11,"Gay Pride is in trouble - this time next year, we'll be hosting Europride, a kind of European Olympics of gayness, without any actual sport. Judging by the pretty poor Athens turnout last year, Europride is actually a lot better at bringing in tourists than the Olympics, and that's before you even consider the fact that we're not going to win the bid anyway, however many brightly coloured banners entreat us to back it. The problem is sponsorship; two agencies hired to drum up blue-chip support resigned within a month of one another, saying there wasn't enough interest. A number of high-profile sponsors of previous gay events - Interflora, Virgin Atlantic, BT - have refused to be involved in this year's Pride. That leaves the organisers with Ford, Virgin Mobile and the office of the Mayor of London, which is some come-down from the days when companies were clamouring to get their logos on to street parties like this.  Practically speaking, I don't think this is the end of the world - the elements of carnival that require sponsorship are things like sound systems, barriers, streamers along the lines of a church hall party for disadvantaged children, and clearing them all up afterwards. If you couldn't afford the temporary street furniture, you wouldn't need to clean it up. Just because Virgin Atlantic didn't ""see anything that they thought would be a good fit for their brand"", there wouldn't be any shortage of carousers wearing flashing devil horns and chancers selling Red Stripe at hilarious prices. I don't hold with it as an adage for the rest of the year, but definitely at festival time the best things in life are free. Still, it's an interesting development in the world of corporate branding. Why were they so keen to sponsor this event in the first place? And what's changed, in the ""fit"" between an airline and a carnival of broad-mindedness?  I don't think this sponsorship was ever an attempt to woo the pink pound specifically - that might have been a side issue, but the association had broader aims than that. Signing up as an active supporter of a gay event sends out a variety of messages. It allies your company to youth and modernity; it presents a friendly face, a ""we're just like you - we like fun, too!"" which has become especially important as radical politics in the last decade has swerved away from governments as foes, and towards corporations. Furthermore, this is the safest and least contentious of celebrations - it has a political foundation, which lends it a certain good-natured gravity and validates the hedonism with feelgood principles. And it is unarguable - there simply aren't many people left who object to homosexuality, or at least who would do so openly, so a sponsor can cash in on all the associations of courage and tolerance that involvement brings without risking very much. So what's changed? An arrangement as mutually beneficial as that should have gone on for years.  The most positive spin possible is that homophobia is such a dead duck, prejudice-wise, such an ancient and laughable concept, that companies just don't get enough bang for their buck when they declare themselves its enemy. If sexual prejudice of this sort is indeed over, then sponsoring a celebration of gay culture is like sponsoring a party to mark the end of slavery - sure, it's a good thing for it to be over, but it's so completely over that to mark its passing feels a bit passe, a bit suspect, even, to be the kind of company that doesn't know how passe it is.  If this is the case, then it's good news for equality generally, but pretty bad news for Gay Pride, since the further down the road of tolerance we travel, the less likely they are ever to get sponsored by anybody. However, it doesn't ring totally true - the evidence doesn't suggest that being gay is losing its taboo on a steady curve. There were more high-profile attacks on gay men last year, for instance, than in the three previous years put together. Legislatively - in terms of gay marriage, adoption - the passage to equality seems to have stalled, rather.  The alternative thesis is that, even if the actual conditions and legal position of homosexuals haven't changed all that much, even if society is shot through with as much prejudice as five or even 10 years ago, the atmosphere has nevertheless changed, to the degree that the crusade just isn't cool any more. It has changed as a result of politicians in general, and the Tory party in particular - during the last election campaign, whenever they said anything at all draconian, or intolerant, or authoritarian, someone would pop up and reassure everyone that, whatever they thought about asylum seekers, gay people were still A-okay.  The issue of homosexuality has been used like a clove of garlic against the vampire of being seen as hardline or fanatical - they didn't quite believe it would work, but it was always worth a try. The upshot is that corporations no longer want to get financially involved with gay rights but the statutory landscape hasn't changed much, either. Nice. Just as Michael Howard skulks off the stage, there's still one more thing to blame him for ..."
11,"It is to become law in Spain that men do as much housework as their wives. Well, it's not strictly speaking a law - more a change to the marriage contract to include a pledge to share cleaning burdens and such. It's coming in as a section of divorce reform, so that ""he never did any washing up"" will soon be fair grounds for parting, whereas before the idle spouse would have had to go to the Spanish equivalent of Brighton (Torremolinos?) with a hooker and a private dick. Nobody will actually be sent to prison for watching Biggos Brotheros when there were clearly chores to be done. But it ""sends a message"", said Margarita Uria, the parliamentarian who pushed for the clause.  I suggested much the same thing myself one time, when I was concocting the manifesto for a fourth political party, as part of a women's magazine jape - my plan was that tax would be paid in inverse proportion to the amount of housework a person did, so that a man doing an average amount (the figure at that time was 24 minutes a day, to a woman's two hours and a bit) would end up paying 75% tax, while his lady friend paid a quarter. The truly crafty thing about my plan was that it wasn't really about the sexes at all, it was ushering in socialism through the back door - because, working on the assumption that the best-paid member of a household is generally speaking the most slothful, all households would end up paying way over 50% in tax. Plus, the complex monitoring systems (nationwide CCTV, finger sensors to register contact with Vim etc) would put the structures in place for me to become a totalitarian dictator when I wanted to take things a few steps further. Nobody called me on this nefarious long game since it was, as I say, a jape; and I have to say that I'm surprised that any plan, anywhere in Europe, that resembled mine even a tiny bit ever got beyond the status of jape.  In Spain, the domestic burden on women appears very onerous - the average man spends 44 minutes a day on cleaning and 51 on childcare, while his wife spends nearly six hours on both. The figure is unenlightening, though, since it doesn't factor in how many women work full-time, so there must be spikes in the graph from women without jobs who do nearly everything about the house. I don't think anyone would seriously counter that it was misogynistic for the person who didn't have to go to work to do other stuff instead, even if that ""other stuff"" were the tedious business of cleaning. A lot of regular work is very tedious as well. My view is that in a household where two people work, the bulk of the cleaning is undertaken by the person with the highest standards. Technically speaking, it is unfair, since even a person with infinitesimally higher standards will end up doing the lion's share of the work. (You only need to think ""I can no longer stand to look at that washing up"" a minute before your spouse thinks it, and lo, you've done it.)  In peculiar relationships, couples vie to have the lowest standards and descend into unspeakable squalor. Otherwise, it might generally be women who do the cleaning, but as one of the third generation of fully employed females in my family, I can tell you that this is a cultural hangover, and will erode over time. Cleanliness isn't innate to the female psyche. I have a fragment of week-old Wotsit wedged in my keyboard, and that's why I rarely use the letter ... oh never mind. What's curious and telling, I think, is that such an issue has to be addressed at a constitutional level, rather than a domestic one. Women, in other words, ought to be able to fight this battle themselves. What's wrong with negotiation? Whatever happened to old-fashioned nagging and moaning?  There's actually not a bad parallel with our Asbo debate. Where once neighbours would negotiate between themselves and, in the case of a particularly noxious neighbour, gather to voice their discontent, they now call the police. The police have no legislation on which to act, so sooner or later, the legislation is supplied. But legislation is a blunt and insensitive tool, so before you know it, eccentric or unpopular citizens get an Asbo for getting undressed with the curtains open or gardening in their pants. Large, flabby concepts - sociability, consideration, cleanliness, fairness - are best addressed on a small scale. The law is only really good for the small, concrete things that can be measured in cash or stitches.  So Ms Uria is right. This Spanish business does send a message, but the message is: ""We Spanish women are too clean, and we aren't good enough at moaning."" I want to say that they should take a masterclass from the French, but I'm scared of sounding like a Tory ..."
11,"I complain a lot (in my own time ...) about the proliferation of stories concerning IVF and fertility in general, since I can generally detect a conservative and/or misogynistic subtext to them, a niggling ""you can't have it all, girls"" message in every anecdotal conception trauma dressed up as news. But at the very least, you can find a correlation between the rising prominence of IVF in the news agenda and its increasing occurrence in the health service. The number of women having IVF each year has reached the region of 30,000. Regardless of the spin you put on their individual stories (selfish, NHS-draining feminist hellcats or regular people having a medical procedure?), their number is substantial enough to warrant a place in cultural debate.  The same couldn't be said for ""the young career women who are putting motherhood on ice"", a story from the weekend papers about women who are freezing their eggs so they have time to have a career and find a perfect mate, rather than getting a career, then settling for the first chap who comes along with passable motility.  This was trumpeted with remarkable prominence in the Independent on Sunday. Clinics ""around the country"" were reporting ""increasing numbers"" of women who chose the freezing for ""lifestyle"", rather than medical, reasons. It sounds like a bit of a trend, doesn't it, something to maybe keep an eye on, if only from an anthropological point of view. You have to dive in a really committed way into the text before you get to any figures.   By ""around the country"" they mean that nine clinics are offering this treatment. By ""increasing numbers"", they mean that eight out of 26 women, in the instance they gave, were undergoing it for lifestyle reasons. If each clinic has the same number of ball-busting, career-loving lifestyle-seekers, that is still only 72 women. In the whole of Great Britain. I bet there are more women who practise fish taxidermy, who go naked curling, who re-enact famous battles of the English civil war every weekend.  The egg-freezing business might lack the spontaneity that some fondly attach to the miracle of birth, but if this is a trend, then so is a polyester bed-jacket with puppies appliqued on to the collar. You can do this with practically any birth-based ""craze""   you come across in the media - the women who leave it too late to find a partner and then engage in ""sperm banditry"" (conceiving without checking whether it's OK with the sperm manufacturer); the women who leave it a little bit late, then have a premature menopause and find it's suddenly way too late. Always skip to the figures: most of the time, they barely count as a handful.  If you file the nuts and bolts of conception under ""personal choice"", it all seems very strange. Personal choices obviously do make the news, but only if a lot of people are making the same ones. If, on the other hand, you file unusual conception methods under ""crime or misdemeanour"", their status in the agenda suddenly makes sense. Aberrant behaviour doesn't need the meat of numbers to make it interesting, it's interesting all on its own. These stories can only loom so large on the landscape if the subtext exists that they are unnatural, wrong and, crucially, a matter of public rather than private interest.  The boundary between public and private can't get any more blurred than it does in childbirth. The law takes it as given that, at a certain point in gestation, the foetus has rights distinct from those of its parents and at that point, any choices made by said parents could no longer be called ""personal"". But the law at least has the grace to formalise that boundary: to determine a time at which abortion is no longer permissible, to establish the furthest acceptable limits of genetic engineering, and so on.  The media has no such compunction. It simply decides, according to nothing more rigorous than whim, the point at which a woman's choice becomes a matter of public interest. It then magnifies those choices until they seem ludicrously prevalent to avoid the obvious question we might otherwise ask: ""Why are you banging on about this so much?""  The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that, for all the lip service paid to a woman's right to choose, there is still deep-seated reluctance to cede fertility control to the individual. Unless, of course, that individual happens to be male. In that case, he could be laying down sperm for the future in the freezers of his local KwikSave. Not until it was such a trend that there was no room for the fishfingers would you hear a squeak about it."
11,"Leaving aside considerations of career, hair loss and ultimate power, frequently of life and death proportions, over sundry nations, who would you rather be? Tony Blair, who is now officially the Worst Briton in Britain? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who is only the 99th worst, beaten effortlessly by all the representatives of his own party that your average person could name, and safe in the knowledge that the only people in Britain less annoying than he is are the Atomic Kittens? It's a close call - if you're going to feature on such a list, it's good to be at the top, since it means people have heard of you. But in an ideal world, of course, your voting public wouldn't hate you at all - they would respect you,   like what they did in the olden days.  This poll is bad news all round for the government -people still reserve some venom for Peter Mandelson, who weighs in at number 49, substantially above Sting. It seems that no amount of sacking this man will make people forget about him. What do they want, blood? Even Lord Irvine of Lairg gets a look-in, and the sheer scale of research it takes to get from ""that bloke with the wallpaper"" to his correct title demonstrates the level of rancour he leaves in his wake.  There is also good news - there were only 100,000 respondents to the poll, and there was a slight bias in so far as they were all viewers of Channel 4. This makes it marginally less representative than local elections, and governments never take a blind bit of notice of those. Plus, there are myriad anomalies - while the Blairs warrant two separate entries (Cherie makes it to number 89), the Hamiltons appear as one single entity of pure badness (at number 19). If, therefore, Alastair Campbell (57) wanted to put a spin on this, he could take an average of the Blair-Booth axis (45), putting them on a par with Pete Waterman. Well, you wouldn't put it past him, which probably explains the fact that he himself has been deemed much more hateful than Alan Titchmarsh (who'd have thought?).  One further political insight offered by the poll is the strong case for an end to the monarchy - the Queen, apparently, is the 10th worst   Briton, and considering all she ever does is go on trips and break up the grinding tedium of Christmas eating, this seems a little harsh. Even low-profile and ex-royals get mentioned, although the significant absence of the Princes William and Harry does suggest that what the voters want is not so much an end to the royal family as an organised cull as soon as they hit 30. Like in that Jude Law film.   Otherwise, though, there is no real consistency to the list - people don't seem to like the inarticulate (Gareth Gates, 6), but nor do they like the articulate (Martin Bashir, 5). Chefs who lick their fingers the whole time irk (Nigella, 90); but so do the ones who can take or leave the licking   (Jamie Oliver, 28); as well as the ones who positively despise it (Delia, 78). Many of those featured also appeared on the 100 Best Britons, which highlights the already pretty obvious point that these are just the people we've heard of, and they can be either the best or the worst, depending on our mood.  Naturally, though, the poll has been used as an opportunity to trot out that old truism: the British hate success. Every development,    however minor, in popular culture, spawns this analysis - the Americans ""really do enjoy having celebrities"" (Terry Jones), they have a ""whole notion of the American dream"" (Sarah Dunant), whereas the British like to build people up just to knock them down, like to mock and carp, enjoy nothing more than watching Ali G gulling a politician or Princess Anne with a custard pie in her face. This is variously interpreted by media pundits as sophistication and healthy jaundice (if you see what I mean), and by politicians as cynicism and pessimism (Blair, in particular, is always ""blasting cynicism"". He has a knack of making politics sound like cheapo DIY. First, you blast the cynicism, then you can Artex the public services). It's time to lay this to rest - it is a   nonsense to claim that we hate success per se.  You will not find anyone on this list who has made a genuine and lasting contribution to life as we know it. There are no doctors or scientists; no academics, poets or composers; no trade union leaders, no charity bosses, no nurses, no inventors. There aren't even any dead people on it, since by the very act of being dead and still famous, they assert their long-term impact. The only artists who appear are better known as self-publicists, and the only novelist is also a journalist (ahem). We don't hate success at all; we just hate people who make a lot of noise, for no great reason, particularly first thing in the morning. Is that so wrong?"
11,"Aren't you glad you bothered to vote, when new legislation is coming so thick and fast and excitingly? I am talking about dogs; and I'm being sarcastic. At least one of those two statements would hold true almost every time I have my mouth open, but that's another story. These are the proposals: that dog owners, being in the possession of a nuisance barker, would face a £5,000 fine, possible imprisonment, eviction from council housing or an Asbo or both. Punishment that harsh always has the ring of the hypothetical to me - at the end of droll stories about people selling their votes on eBay, responsible newscasters generally pointed out that you could face a £5,000 fine or imprisonment or both for misusing a vote. Yeah, right, we thought. In the words of the great Sharon Stone in her fabled no-underwear film, ""What are you gonna do, arrest me for smoking?"" Still, whenever a new piece of legislation comes out, it's worth wondering why, unless we're to believe that lawmakers just like to keep busy. Apparently, noisy dogs are second only to loud music in the list of aural complaints people have. Even a dog-lover would admit that was bad, although it smacks faintly of the statistic that suicide is the second biggest killer of young men. There isn't that much to choose from, is there? Only singers and dogs feel the need to express themselves with long bursts of unarticulated noise. We all have something - a histrionic personality, an ear for rousing choral music, an urge to reproduce - that will at some point be a nuisance to our neighbours. Ergo, when they make a noise that irritates us, it's a boon, since it's money in the civic bank for when we want to make a noise that irritates them. I had this theory brutally tested when my downstairs neighbour held a sing-along-a-Sound-of-Music party in her garden, but it held. Clearly, though, the majority view is that one has a right to expect an environment no noisier than mild hubbub. To explain a new law, however, you need to ask not only how bad is the problem, but also whether it's got worse. Are there more domestically kept dogs than there have been in the past? No, the dog population is in steady decline. There are more cats, but they don't make much noise, although they do (in my view) look at you funny. There are more urban foxes, which make more noise copulating than a dog could if it were trying to bark a greeting to its cousin in Scotland, but that's by the by. There are no more dogs. Are dog owners less responsible than before? Hard to tell - if all society is going to antisocial hell in a handcart, dog owners would hardly be exempt. But having said that, the highest level of ownership is among 45-54-year-olds, so we're not dealing with the binge-drinking, street-brawling, Turkey-Twizzler-munching youths for whom the whole concept of Asbo was invented. Here's an idea - maybe dogs bark more than they used to; maybe they're going through some kind of moral disintegration of their own, mirroring the steady march of self-interest they see in the wider society with the only form of delinquency they know, unless you count biting and bolting and chasing livestock. Instinct tells me this isn't the case, but I can scarcely hear my instinct over all this canine yodelling. Maybe, as a nation, we're making less informed breed choices, taking fewer walks, failing to train the beasts properly. Maybe the government needs a few windfall £5,000 fines, to make up for the gossamer lightness of our tax burden. Maybe prisons aren't full enough, and they're looking for a new band of people to incarcerate; maybe council houses are too full, and they're looking for a new cause for eviction (although, in fact, 70% of dogs live in owned houses which makes them the ABC1s of the pet world). Maybe there's an anti-dog conspiracy fuelled by people like Alastair Campbell, who I can take one look at and know isn't a dog-person. Maybe it's a veiled threat to Roy Hattersley (toe the line, buster, or your noisy pal gets it). Or, just possibly, we're failing to adapt properly to our increasingly concentrated living arrangements. Downsizers make the news for their funny views, but the trend is still towards urban living. We talk a lot about what modifications this might demand in terms of public services, transport infrastructure, housing and such, but we could gainfully explore what changes are required on an individual level. Changes such as chill out, buy some earplugs, stop bellyaching. We'll be fining people for having noisy infants next, and then there really will be trouble."
11,"Tony Blair's annual make-up spend differs, it seems, according to what paper you look at. I read that since 2003 it was &pound;1,000, plus &pound;791.20 on make-up artists. My boyfriend came up with the rather more outlandish figure of two grand per press conference; he must have misunderstood. For that kind of money, the prime minister could have substantial new breasts implanted for every occasion, and would by now look like a lovely healthy heffer.Still, it's a lot of money. I doubt if we're approaching an actor or model's outlay, but he effortlessly outstrips the spending of the average British woman (&pound;195 a year) and, unless the world turned upside down without my noticing, must have spent in two years what the average British man would spend in two or three lifetimes.It's not exactly a Fisher model of statistical analysis, but I still, in my humble way, think it's fair to extrapolate thus: if fleshtone Tony spends about 10 times what a regular woman spends on make-up, then he probably spends in the same ratio on shoes. Research a fortnight ago showed that the average woman, in her lifetime, spent &pound;32,000 on pleasing footwear. Take Blair's tenure as prime minister to be, so far, one-tenth of his life expectancy, and he's already coughed up nearly 40 grand on shoes. For that, you could buy a hospital, albeit quite a small one. I wonder if it was public money? I wonder if he ever wears them? I wonder if he has loads of black pairs that, to the naked eye, seem quite identical? Fancy having to wait until after recess to get these questions answered.Now, the general rule with all cosmetic enhancements is that if you're embarrassed to admit it, then don't do it. I happened to be at the press conference in which Tony Blair famously claimed to have got his facial tanning from the ""Downing Street garden"", which was unlikely for so many reasons; it was two weeks before the election, for starters, a time not spent swivelling in the backyard like a pig on a spit; plus, the alert Londoner noticed immediately that, unless Downing Street gets a special kind of weather, it wasn't actually that hot. Straight away, then, you have a man who's ashamed of himself and pretending not to be, which makes him just about the easiest target in the world.The problem is, everyone is ashamed of this stamp of vanity, apart from sociopaths. Silvio Berlusconi was openly delighted with his facial surgery. The juxtaposition of those two sentences might lead some to suppose that I'm calling Berlusconi a sociopath. For legal reasons, I'd like to stress that that definitely isn't what I'm saying.Easy, you might say - if make-up is embarrassing, and you don't want to be embarrassed, and you don't want to lie, then don't wear it. But this leaves you with a whole new set of problems - namely, a grey complexion, tired eyes and the inescapable fact that Charles Kennedy, blessed with his marvellous pinkness, looks more cheerful than you do.Blair has always been accused of trading on his attractiveness to the lady voter, but I think the truth is something even more icky - he has in fact been stressing his youth, forging this very unsophisticated connection between his revolutionary new ways of being a ""socialist"" and the fact that his physique is firmer than the other older geezers and he definitely didn't have wayward eyebrows.Now he's lodged this alliance between ideology and aesthetic in our minds, he simply cannot afford to age gracefully; if we wanted rugged authenticity, we'd get it from Gordon Brown. So in many ways, it is a straight choice between a shed load of blusher and standing down, and you can see why he's chosen as he has, even though there might be more dignity in the other course. Let's not forget, moreover, the threat posed by the Tory leadership election - with Michael Howard and his monochrome visage out of the picture, they are free to go as fresh as they like. They're a treacherous bunch, there's no knowing what they might do. They could get one with a whole load of hair.In the spirit of goodwill, here are my suggestions: first, tone the slap down. You only need to be an even colour all over, and you'll look more attractive. You don't have to be the colour of David Hasselhof. Second, money and thereby awkwardness will be saved if you learn to apply it yourself. It's a simple buffing motion, most adults can master it.Third, if you ever put your hands in your own pockets and paid for it out of your substantial salary, though it was for public engagements, then you might find scandals of this sort didn't happen. Honestly, if he wasn't such a skinflint, his skincare would be nobody's business but his."
11,"It doesn't seem to take much to pass for humour in Westminster. This is because they are ruminating to the very limits of their concentration, on matters of national importance, almost all the time. I imagine. Anyway, this is the ""joke"" still circulating - what have Julius Caesar and Charles Kennedy got in common? They both got stabbed in the back by men in sandals. I don't think Caesar was stabbed in the back. I think he was stabbed from the side, just below the throat. Jesus. I just called MPs humourless, and then went and said a thing like that. I wish I were dead.Meanwhile, Mark Oaten, who had recently thrown his hat into the Lib Dem leadership ring, was spotted in Savile Row. He needed a new hat. No, I'm sorry about that; he was buying shirts. An unnamed Labour ""wag"" remarked to an unnamed media pal that he should have been buying a beard and sandals.Now, here's the thing - beards have never been a liberal schtick. Not since the days when they were a foot long and everyone was a liberal unless they were a Whig or some sort of freak. Beards are a socialist thing. They date back to a time when people grew them for warmth, because they couldn't afford scarves. New Labour hates the beard, so far to the left is this facial furniture. The status of the sandal in wider life, for that matter, has totally changed, since the footwear first became associated with the liberal. Sandals are very fashionable, these days. Slinky, delicate ones are fashionable, and chunky, lentil-y ones are fashionable. In evidence, I offer the Birkenstock, which is so fashionable that Mr Birkenstock is engaged in legal proceedings against his ex-wife, Mrs Birkenstock, over who's allowed to call themselves ""Birkenstock"". To hear politicians insult one another in this way, through the conduit of fashion, is like listening to two people engage in a French slanging match, when neither of them speaks French.David Cameron, meanwhile, wowed the world with his special-edition Converse trainers. When we say ""special edition"", we don't mean an awful lot - they weren't radically expensive (50 squids; far less expensive than, say, a Savile Row hat), and not all that rare. But Will Smith wore some once, and the last Tory leader you can picture emulating Will Smith ... well, there's never been one. Although it's conceivable that Thatcher would have worn a long, black leather coat, and passed for Keanu Reeves.These Converse have caused an amazing storm. The Express is offering its readers a chance to win a pair, that they might look more like Cameron; media-wide, everyone is taking it as a sign of his groundbreaking modernity, even though when he speaks, it sounds like exactly the same amateurish, on-the-hoof carping that Michael Howard had down to such a tee. They do themselves an injustice, these politicos, when they harp on about clothing. They think it makes them sound more like us, more liable to be voted for by the fabled 16-24s who make the world go round. Instead, it makes them sound daft. It makes shoes sound daft. It's brought me very close to going out in my socks."
11,"A report out yesterday showed that people value parks almost as highly as they value local primary schools. Taking this passion as a starting point, the report goes on to suggest new ways of running green spaces that don't rely on councils doing anything sensible or efficient.  Generally, a development like that would raise the spectre of privatisation and such, but since nobody's ever going to pay to go into a park and there's no enthusiasm for flogging them off to build bijou residences, this really might be as it seems. Communities genuinely prize these spaces; so much, in fact, that they'd rather look after them with volunteer park-tender organisations than leave them to the fate of the neglected municipal pools, with crumbling tiles and floating verrucas.   Now, it's true that councils do a rubbish job of looking after common land. Parkies are such Beano relics that if you saw one you'd think it was a paedophile in disguise. If you ask me, we should take the primary-school parallel one stage further, and introduce faith-based parks, where high standards are maintained by a bunch of people busting a gut to behave well because they're all pretending to be Anglicans.   But it's still strange that parks arouse such passion, since nobody uses them. Actually, that's not strictly true - there are two days at the beginning of summer when people pile in at lunchtime and sit gingerly on the grass, convinced against the evidence of all their five senses that they're perched on dog shit and will probably get that disease that sends you blind. (Note to the irregular park user: there has been a revolution in poo-tidying - it isn't like the 80s any more.)   Otherwise, though, you can go weeks, indeed, whole seasons, without seeing anybody at all. Regular people don't use parks: alcoholics use parks, and dogs use parks, accompanied by their owners for the sole purpose of making sure they cross the road safely. And yet such niggardly effort as is expended by councils is directed exclusively at making life difficult for winos (by closing the park at dusk) and dogs (by making all the best bits no-dog areas). This is an outrage that, were I to dwell on it, would make my head explode.   Still, people are inordinately proud and protective over these spaces they never go in. I have yet to meet a single person from Sheffield who doesn't tell me that their home city has more area covered by national park than any other. The only piece of successful direct action I've ever witnessed came about when Southwark council tried to introduce the nightly locking of Warwick Gardens. (There was a sit-in of 20 people, the council relented, the local paper rejoiced, it was a mini-adventure.) A New Labour policy wonk told me, in all seriousness, that the proudest moment of his career was when he saved Peckham Rye from developers as a young councillor.   The first step in the ABC of creating a futuristic dystopia for the purposes of film or literature is always to concrete over the green areas. The second thing people who don't like Tokyo tell you about Tokyo is that it has no parks. (The first thing is that you can buy schoolgirls' knickers in vending machines. I still don't know whether that's true.) These places are not prized for their practical use or, if they are, only by a very small percentage of those who prize them. Although undeveloped land manifestly does bring benefits, you'd only have to suggest a wind farm on Hampstead Heath to discover how minor a consideration the green argument is.   Commons are cherished as symbols, and they manage, with very little effort beyond being green, to symbolise an awful lot. They remind us that, contrary to the messages sent out by relentless privatisation, certain things will never be for sale, simply because they're not for sale. The more expensive land gets, the more important a message this is. Commons reinforce a sense of community not because we meet on them and chat, but because they are jointly owned. Sure, hospitals and schools are jointly owned also, but that feels like cooperation with the practical purpose of pooling resources. With parks, we share and cooperate for no better reason than that we feel like it.   There is a lofty satisfaction to be got from the creation and protection of beauty for its own sake. Once, this made people want to build. We've lost our enthusiasm for the folly and the cathedral - now we want to un-build. Add to that the fact that parks are no longer covered in canine detritus (go on, go for a walk if you don't believe me!) and they really convey a message of peerless social importance. I've half a mind to knock down my flat and make an ornamental garden."
11,"The wisdom of debating a TV programme that has yet to be aired is arguable, but the case of Julia Black's forthcoming programme about abortion is more clear-cut than most. The film, due to be aired later this month, includes images of aborted foetuses at 10, 11 and 21 weeks.  Typically, the people who insist on representing the reality of abortion with pictures of 21-week-old foetuses are anti-abortionists - at this stage, of course, the embryo is very identifiably human. It has an outside chance of sustaining life if it were nurtured rather than discarded. A termination at 21 weeks looks as much like murder as it ever will, and the fact that this ""reality"" occurs only in a few very exceptional cases tends to be ignored in favour of maximum-impact images.   Black, on the other hand, is no anti-abortionist. She was brought up in favour of a woman's right to choose (her father set up Marie Stopes International), and has upheld that belief, though since having a child has registered more ambiguous feelings. Her project, therefore, could conceivably leave her on perilous territory with no allies whatsoever. Those in favour of abortion will object to her using this visual vocabulary, which seems to locate her, ideologically, somewhere between the Pope and the lunatic Americans who nail-bomb clinics. And those against abortion will object to the fact that, actually, she is not with them at all.   In between those two poles will be people who question the motive behind all this. Black claims she wants to make society ""re-examine its views on abortion"". This is the kind of milky, faux-impartiality that documentary makers shouldn't be able to get away with. Re-examine our views in which direction? On what basis? That if we knew how icky it would be, we wouldn't do it? Without a solid ethical position, this looks like attention-seeking, which is a childish impulse to bring to the debate.   But this film could trigger one valuable shift - it could, indeed it must, force pro-choicers to defend their position. Anti-abortionists set out and argue their position all the time; they have euphemisms (""pro-life"" for instance), but aren't afraid of the words - abortion, foetus, baby, termination - and they aren't afraid to interpret them. But pro-choicers simply will not call themselves pro-abortionists. I suppose we could pretend this was to avoid confusion - it might sound as if we believed that, ideally, all pregnancies would end in termination - but that is disingenuous. We don't use the word because it's not very nice. This dovetails with the ongoing taboo around termination. One in three women will have a termination. Why will you never hear a woman say she's had one? Why this persistent guilty silence? Why the standard-issue terminology, where if you do discuss abortion on a personal level at all, it has to be in terms of guilt, and sorrow, and confusion, and anger?   It's because those of us who are in favour of abortions have never thrashed out a rational justification. We let our mothers campaign for its legality, breathed a huge sigh of relief that we could now abort on main roads, rather than back streets, and never stopped to say, ""I believe this is my right, and here's why."" So, everyone's in this ethical twilight, where we know it's OK, because everyone else has had one; and yet at the same time, we're not completely convinced it's not murder, so we definitely won't be bringing it up at dinner parties.   But that kind of ambiguity is completely inappropriate. Every woman considering an abortion - every woman who's even sexually active - has to decide what, for her, constitutes murder. If you abort at a point when the foetus, if supported, could survive without you, is that murder? Does an embryo only become a human being at nine months? Given that a 12-week-old embryo bears the hallmarks of humanity, does that make it human? We've got into a situation where, because the questions are difficult, we don't ask them. But that makes us easy to attack, because our silence carries such an obvious implication of shame, and what do we have to be ashamed of, if we don't half-believe that this ""collection of cells"" is actually a very, very small life?   On this matter, we don't need more sympathy or understanding - we need to be tougher-minded and more rigorous, both on ourselves, and with each other. Women with any reservations at all about whether abortion is a right or a crime, well, just don't do it - what in your lifestyle is so valuable that it is worth turning yourself into a killer? And the rest of us, without those reservations, with full confidence in the legitimacy of terminating inchoate foetuses, should for God's sake attest to that publicly and stop colluding in this taboo. We give our opponents more power with our shuffling evasiveness than gory footage of abortions ever will."
11,"At his monthly press conference yesterday, Tony Blair told Oona Blackman, a journalist on the Daily Mirror: ""Sorry, darling, I'll get to you."" Would that get your hackles up? Or would you think, ""Here's a good turn, I'm practically family. In a couple of weeks, he'll be telling me what he really thinks of the death penalty vis-a-vis Saddam Hussein.""It is fine among family members. Well, it is fine from parents to children. From children to parents it sounds a bit patronising, a bit ""your time is past, now I get to call you treasure.""Between siblings, it's fine but affected (you never called one another darling when you were eight, now did you?) Between lovers it is, of course, obligatory. Between friends it's OK but choose your endearments carefully. If you blow all your sweet nothings on friends, your life-partner will be piqued.In the workplace, it would never be OK for a man thus to address a female subordinate, but between female peers it tends to be OK, except that a pleasing term should not be used to take the sting out of an annoying request (""Honey, would you mind terribly staying late? I'd do it myself, only I have to get to Fenwicks before they sell out of that expensive thing that you probably can't afford""). And you have to be careful of the way one endearment slides into another. One minute, you're calling your co-worker ""darling"", and the next you'll call him or her ""tootletots"" or ""perfect pie"" or, worse, ""hot stuff"" or ""professor big trousers"". And that is weird.As prime minister, I would be inclined to steer away from love bombs altogether, since it's not very authoritative. If he wants to mix it up a bit with unexpected modes of address, he could do worse than ""pal"" and ""matey moo""."
11,"I'm trying to work out what my objection is to doing sporting activities on behalf of charities. At first I thought it was unrelated to the charitable act itself - this was when I got caught last weekend in the middle of some charity cyclists, and they a) were very annoying cyclists, constantly making merry and observing poor lane discipline; b) were all wearing T-shirts that matched, like some kind of stag weekend, only not, obviously, drunk; and c) had festooned those T-shirts with some really irritating wordplay like The Only Way Is Forward (on the front) and Let's See The Back Of Sickle-Cell Disease (on the back - and it's not that I can't apprehend the seriousness of sickle cell disease: it's the jollity. I can't stand joy!). But that's not it at all. Someone then floated past me the idea that I might do a trek in Peru, to raise money for breast cancer. I'm wholeheartedly in favour of raising money for breast cancer, and I think I probably like trekking, and I like Peru, yet the idea appalled me, which you have to put down to the trial of asking your friends for money. The contract becomes: you, friend, should sponsor me for some effort I might put in, but really it would be nudging at the boundaries of fellowship to expect you to care whether I trek or cycle or hop to Peru, though for some reason it is necessary for me to do so - we can't just all, you know, put our hands in our pockets and give away some money. The implication is that the friend won't engage in charitable giving independently of you. Furthermore, that your physical toil is of so great a merit that nobody need trouble themselves as to how much you're giving, they must just stand back and applaud you, perhaps by flapping fivers in your face. And furthermore (I'm sure this is how it works) some of the money raised will help get you to Peru, since I'm pretty sure you don't walk there, and even if you don't use your friends' money for this but your own, wouldn't the breast cancer cause have been better served by you and your friends just giving it some money without involving Peru? And isn't it patronising to the friends? If you want your friends to pay for your sweat, in the service of some charitable goal for which you'll, ultimately, end up taking the credit, why not offer to scrub their stairs or help them move? That's before you even get on to the cause, which has to be uncontroversial, because you'd anticipate asking everybody you'd ever met to sponsor you, so it couldn't be, you know, Ban Trident or Excise American Fundamentalists From African Aid Programmes. And that's fine, since most diseases and causes are fairly uncontroversial, but there's something about that ideological flattening-out that feels so depressingly apple pie and third way and ITV-on-a-Saturday-Night. Again, just give away some money! Let your friends choose their own cause. They might like controversy. Yes, this argument relies on me, right now, giving some money to a breast cancer charity. And also, you're quite right, to one for sickle-cell anaemia, too."
11,"I always thought Fathers4Justice would fall out when that fella climbed the Tower Bridge crane with the distinct intimation of his bollocks poking out of his over-pants. That's pretty bad, isn't it? That can't have been in the committee meeting: let's dress up like Spider-Man (Dangerdad! To the rescue! Earthbound women can't stop us, just watch them try!), climb up something high (have a go at that, single mumslag), compromise national security (what if we'd been al-Qaida?) and then make ourselves look irredeemably ludicrous with the small matter of the too-tight tights and the insufficiently capacious superhero undercrackers. Lobby groups have fallen out over less; Ukip fell out over Kilroy-Silk. Nope. They weathered that storm. Everybody laughed. They stood firm. And what finally does for them is the threat to kidnap Leo Blair. I don't think I'm risking the youngling's security by saying, boys, you're better than this. I always thought that when the papers got hold of a possible kidnap story - a Beckham child, for instance - it was because one of the tot's parents had an autobiography due out. So far as I know, neither Blair has any literature in the pipeline, though with Cherie's Married To The Prime Minister currently standing at 14,217 in the online charts, she might like to consider kidnapping one of her children to mark her next publishing venture. Perhaps she'd like to kidnap Euan and send clippings of his facial furniture to the press, as proof it was him. That would indeed be evil genius. I'd read almost anything she wrote after that. Sorry, I was ignoring Fathers4Justice. This happens to them a lot, I feel sure, otherwise they wouldn't be such nutjobs. The ""moderate"" centre of the organisation never wanted to kidnap Leo at all. It was unkind; plus, if they were any good at kidnapping children, they'd be able to get ahold of their own, instead of climbing cranes. However, as is so often the case with grass-roots pressure groups (look at the WI - they're always being investigated by Special Branch), an extremist wing hatched this evil plan. It has been suggested by various pundits that this was not a plan so much as an ""inebriated flight of fancy of three men in a pub"" (the Independent). Two reasons why this cannot possibly be the case: first, one of the men's names was Jolly Stanesby. If you are a running joke, liable to get pissed and talk overblown idiocy in a saloon environment, the first thing you do is change your name from Jolly to, I don't know, Mask. Or Leopard. Plus, if you're a drunken fantasist, and Special Branch comes round your house, you don't say, ""They were just warning me not to do anything silly."" You'd say, ""They pinned me down! And then they punctured my big toe with a compass and told me to join their dark society in a brotherhood of toe-blood!"" These men, in other words, were definitely intending to kidnap somebody, even if the finer details have been lost to history. Matt O'Connor is right to close it down. Hopefully, this splinter will reopen as Fathers4Child-Snatching. Then we really will see some bollocks."
11,"Adriana Iliescu, 66, has been accused by a medical ethics group of ""the ultimate act of selfishness"". As if that weren't bad enough, the Daily Mail weighed in with ""and she's single!"" You'd want her to have done something pretty bad to warrant this kind of castigation: set in motion some self-serving property scheme that left hundreds homeless, or released something deadly into a reservoir.Selfishness is rather too nebulous a concept for us to nail down a definition of its ne plus ultra, but at the very least, for this act to be the ultimate, it should be wholly beneficial for Iliescu and wholly damaging for everyone else involved. In fact, she's just given birth, after nine years of fertility treatment. She'll be 87 when her daughter is 21, and - family longevity schmamily schmongevity - she's unlikely to see her scion into her 30s.The worst things that can happen to a child, at the hands of its parents, would be (in roughly descending order): physical and/or mental abuse; death of the parent; unstoppable mental or physical decline of the parent; desertion; profound embarrassment; lack of rough-and-tumble games as a result of parental frailty. Some of these risks are amplified with a 66-year-old mother, and some aren't. There is naturally a greater risk of early bereavement for newborn Eliza Maria, and that's not a risk most parent would willingly bestow.  But when you hear of women within their natural fertility window delaying treatment for a cancer that could well be fatal in order to give birth first, you'd greet that with sympathy and admiration rather than censure. And I didn't pluck that example out of nowhere - I heard it on Radio 4's The Choice. Sure, Iliescu might not play as much knockabout netball as a younger parent, but perhaps she can make up for this deficiency with eye-witness accounts of the second world war. She might embarrass her daughter in the playground, but my sister picked my brother up from school once wearing bondage trousers. These things are all a matter of degrees.  It's hard to have much respect for this mother's powers of reasoning. Women were, she says, put on earth to give birth. It should not take 66 years to get your head around such uncomplicated Darwinism in my view. Nevertheless, it is obvious that objections to her ""selfish act"", trenchant as they sound, are not based on the practical ramifications for the child. It's so obvious I don't even want to choke it out, but men siring children at this age are subjected to no more than a metaphorical elbow in the ribs.There are three reasons why people react so strongly to women tinkering with their fertility. The first is that it's ""against nature"". The cut-off point of the menopause as that at which nature no longer intends you to have children is just daft. Nature intends you to stop having children when you can no longer get pregnant, or carry a child to term. That's it. You might only be 30, but there it is, and any medical intervention to overcome it is, unambiguously, against nature.  To draw a line for female fertility treatment at 50 (as in Britain) might be loosely based on a shared understanding of humanity and fairness, but it is still arbitrary. It's a tired old invocation, this. Nature didn't intend us to fly, either, or to have unlimited access to dolly mixtures. It's funny how you only ever hear about mothers' intentions when you're discussing embryos, or talking homosexuality with a nutter.  Second, less often stated, there is a squeamishness about the sexuality - indeed, the sex organs altogether - of the older female. The story that rammed this home (ahem) most powerfully for me was when Edwina Currie revealed her affair with John Major. He was an old rogue; she was skin-crawlingly icky. This is how it always goes with any woman over about 35. I'm not sure it's something that can be combated, but we need to recognise that it's odd.  Third, society, so used to calling the shots when it comes to death - when you can kill, when you can't; when you can choose to die, when you can't - feels left out of the business of birth. There is a lingering belief that something as axiomatic as the creation of life shouldn't be left to dimwitted females, which is why the most vulnerable, teenagers, are harangued where they should be supported, and why the chance to intervene between a woman and her decisions (supplied by reliance on IVF, for instance) is grabbed at with unseemly enthusiasm. (There is currently a debate about whether prospective IVF parents should be checked for a criminal record. Insane!)  Ultimately, anybody can object to Iliescu all they like, so long as they admit to the roots of their objection. It has little to do with medicine, less to do with ethics, and nothing at all to do with the child."
11,"The row about the allocation of lottery money is - like the one about the rights and wrongs of Goldie Hawn's botox injections - one that started in the Daily Mail and should have ended there. It all began with the £340,000 grant to the National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns. The objection to this was kept fairly oblique, but the bare bones of it seemed to be that while the recipients were plenty poor enough for a grant, they were insufficiently white.  To this injury to right-thinking citizens has been added a further £145,000, the insult here being that the recipient group is ""linked"" to one Gerry German. His offence? No, it isn't his name (you can't blame a man for his name - though if he were called Harry Hun, maybe we could put that to a vote). It's   apparently his history as a ""race zealot"", evinced by the fact that he was part of the Commission for Racial Equality during the 1980s, when it banned the Robertson golliwog for being an offensive racial caricature (when truthfully, it was ... what? A charming and side-splitting toy, of course).   Now, the organisation in line for the cash is the Working Group Against Racism in Children's Resources, whose stated aims are pretty difficult to object to, put like that. The objection is that German the firebrand is its co-founder, and that seems enough to demonstrate, once more, that this money is being spent on causes with an overt dubious political agenda.   The mooted solution is to give buyers the chance to state their preferred charity on the ticket itself. My gut   reaction is that this can't possibly work.   First, of the 28p from every Lotto pound that goes to charity, only 9p is available to the government for redistribution (the rest goes to other bodies, including the Arts Council and the Sports Council). Of that, only a minuscule proportion, 2% tops, is spent on anything even approaching controversy. Even in the crazy mean-mindedness of the Mail's worldview, they can't seriously believe that people resent making the odd contribution of 0.18 pence to anti-racist organisations.   Second, if you're going to be picky about what lottery-ticket buyers want their money spent on, then it might be worth polling them about how much they would choose to spend on high art (the Arts Council - which doesn't extend to museums and galleries, those are covered by the Heritage fund - gets 4.7p per pound. That's a hell of a lot, given that its areas of concentration - opera, poetry, theatre - are such special interest pursuits).   Third, the charities that would get the money if ticket-holders were consulted would inevitably be the same ones that have least problem raising money in the first place.   The only charities in this country that can drum up money really easily are those supporting cancer research, children and dogs (I guess the Daily Mail might want to be able to specify the colour of the children, though I'm not sure how you'd phrase that; comically, the colour of the dogs would never be an issue).   Cancer is a wonderful disease because it doesn't   discriminate, which is why it's so easy to get celebrities involved with it. Children and dogs are cute. Most other things - from Christian Aid to Amnesty, World Wildlife to Wounded Warriors Welfare - make a statement about faith, politics or social priorities. These aren't statements that everyone necessarily wants to make, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't be accommodated within a wider fund that a lot of people are happy to contribute to.   Unglamorous, minority-interest, perhaps ideologically complicated charities are exactly the ones that should benefit from the lottery since, let's face it, they're never going to get Geri Halliwell to launch them a phone-in.   And yet, at the core of the Mail's grimly bigoted objections, there is an unfortunate truth. If a substantial number of Lotto players disagree with where the money goes, yet have no means of influencing the spending, then this isn't a game, it's a tax. What else could you call a sum skimmed off a citizen's spending and redistributed by a government? A gift?   Once you've admitted that it's a tax, you have to clarify what it's a tax on - it's a tax on being poor. Sure, it might also snag some of the stupid rich (Hugh Grant was snapped buying a Lotto ticket only last week), but the real   devotees of the lottery are those to whom the fantasy of the win is attractive enough to off-set its laughable improbability - the more you need the money, the more likely you are to waste it. In other words, it's a total reversal of the principle of taxation, and that can't stand.   So, ticket-holders must be allowed to choose their charities, and if there's a huge cash injection into cancer research, nobody could call that a disaster. Perhaps the government could dip into proper tax to make up the shortfall for the National Coalition of Anti-Deportation groups. Or it could really branch out, and stop deporting people. It might be ethically wrong to ignore the wishes of the lottery punters, but there's no law against a centre-left government adopting a centre-left policy."
1,"Not long ago, George Bush and the Republicans seemed to have something to say to European parties of the right. The British Conservatives, in particular, were entranced. Last December, the red carpet was rolled out when Iain Duncan Smith paid his first visit to Washington as leader. He saw Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, a full house of the warrior right. The Americans, who had often received him when he was Tory defence spokesman, obviously thought he mattered. He for his part saw Bush as a role model. On his return, he wrote a piece headlined ""My Manhattan project for a transatlantic conservative revival"". Each part of this fanciful construct is now in tatters. Bush must wonder what he ever thought he was doing, giving 40 minutes' face-time to the swiftest loser the Tories have ever put in the field. And now the day this president reaches a pinnacle of power, and at last, legitimacy, turns out to be the day when IDS, in the happy phrase of my colleague Simon Hoggart, became the first leader in history to turn himself into a suicide bomber. ""The most desperate day,"" added the Telegraph, of all papers, ""in the history of the Conservative party."" So much for the Manhattan transfer.  But the other part of the ruined conjunction of the transatlantic right is what really matters. This is about agendas not people. Bush has secured his power with an agenda that no mainstream European party could expect to put before its voters and   then win an election. Compassionate conservatism, coined by Bush and lifted by Duncan Smith, was for a time a phrase graced with truth and common relevance. Pumped out often enough, the mantra helped Bush defeat the legacy of the Clinton years without entirely disowning their tender side. Tuesday's victories in the Senate and the House were, by contrast, triumphs for the right, paving the way for an unequivocally rightist programme, in which compassion will be consigned to the wastebin of political artifice where it probably always belonged.  There are ways of denying this analysis, and pretending that the US has not made a clear political choice. Bush, it can be justly said, had the advantage of incumbency at a time of national crisis. If, like 9/11, the crisis unites the nation, a president would be incompetent not to gain strength from it, and Bush has shown that, in the business of partisan campaign politics, he is a master. Presenting himself as a heroic leader - first warlike, then, when the polls shifted, a man of reason at the UN - he placed Saddam Hussein in the gap left by Osama bin Laden in his presidential curriculum vitae. Perhaps he won as a hunter of evil ones on behalf of this great nation, not as an ideologue.  There are other alibis. As incumbents, the Republicans raised more money than the Democrats. To an extent, they bought their victories. These were, in any case, local not national. Bush faced a party, moreover, that was singularly   inept. Ever since Al Gore lost the election the people had really given him in 2000, he failed to perform like an opposition leader. There was no opposition leader. Bush, the heroic riser to the challenge of 9/11, had nobody to match him, round whom the country could gather to express its discontent with an economy that is failing, not to mention the corporate scandals that taint the presidency itself. All this can be used to explain away the election result as something less than a decisive choice with enduring consequences.  But that is not persuasive. Even if the process was messy, the outcome is unambiguous. Now that he controls all the political institutions - House, Senate, White House - Bush can move to infiltrate the judiciary. Dozens of conservative federal judges with lifetime tenure await confirmation they can now expect to get. This will permanently reorient constitutional trends. The slashing of forests and the drilling of wilderness, by timber and oil interests newly let loose, will be still less reversible. The rich men's tax cuts of 2001 will be secured against revision, and other tax cuts added. The 40 million Americans without health insurance can expect   to remain that way. Axioms of inequality will be engraved deeper into the pillars of American society.  None of these preferences has much appeal to many Europeans, and the best exemplar of this is not German social democracy but British conservatism. The Republicans confirm themselves as a role model the Tories cannot follow. This should have been apparent as long ago as the Thatcher era, when the state's share of gross domestic product remained stubbornly unchanged. The high priestess herself had difficulty making Britain into a low-tax society, and was eventually frustrated by popular demand. This has not gone away.  After the Budget last April, when ICM polled voters on Chancellor Brown's tax rises, 76% approved them. More tellingly for any British politician hoping for a rightist resurgence on the back of a Bush-like philosophy, no fewer than 54% of Conservatives thought Brown had done the right thing.  The mid-term elections, therefore, lock the America-Europe divide more firmly into place. They define a society, more starkly than at any time in 50 years, that's trending in a different direction. Far from telling the benighted Tories how to win, they show what IDS's successor will have to avoid if he's to make a rendezvous with the dominant instincts of British society. From east to west, in several unexpected places, sometimes marginally but always decisively, American   voters have made a statement that separates them from most other mature societies.  How this plays out on the international scene is now the question. It may not alter much in the existing prognosis for Iraq. The American stance was already bi-partisan in its rigour. Democrats agreed with Republicans, which was one of the problems they faced in fighting the heroic national leader. Bush's patience in going through the UN process operated in parallel with his willingness to go to war, and this will not change. But neither will the arguments on the other side. The mandate Bush has secured from his own people does have its limits. It may increase his confidence, but doesn't make unilateralism over Iraq any easier an option.  This was the week, however, when the US declared itself a different country. That's what will leave a historic mark. The capture of the Senate makes possible the advance of materialistic individualism on many fronts. State and community are in retreat. Corporate power, instead of being shamed by its recent crimes, can be expected to advance. This is the Republican way, which America has now undeniably endorsed. A truism often heard is that what happens in California today will quickly reach New York. Its sub-clause says that the political economy of the US will sooner or later make its way east to Europe. The 21st century is beginning quite differently."
1,"This week, two former national leaders joined forces to do their country service. They were from different parties, but had each done time in the highest office. As such, they had a role in public and political life that transcended politics. They enjoyed, in a word, general respect. They were and are a credit to their class, the political class. When politics closes down in some societies - whether for the summer or for life - its denizens are not written out of the script. They rise to a certain kind of occasion. Neither Gerald Ford nor Jimmy Carter was among the great US presidents. Arguably they were the two least successful holders of the office since the war. But they carry the stamp. They've kept authority. So it was natural for them to head the National Commission on Federal Election, which was charged with proposing reforms in the aftermath of last November's bitter farce in Florida, hanging chads and all. Their report, with a raft of plans to re-enfranchise voters and make federal elections more meaningful, has been greeted with somewhat restrained enthusiasm by the beneficiary of that calamitous event, George Bush. But nobody has challenged their bipartisan credentials for writing it.  They've both retained post-presidential dignity. Carter in particular has become a kind of ombudsman, often self- appointed, creatively investigating many ills of the world. He seems a selfless, yet still ambitious, man of global purpose. The US is a land of intense partisanship, where the linkage between party and patronage is more richly oiled than it ever is in Britain. Party labels are for life. But great men rise above the battle. They want to. They're allowed to.  In Britain this couldn't happen, and it's hard to be certain why. Former prime ministers are invariably damaged goods. The idea of putting Margaret Thatcher and Jim Callaghan in charge of electoral reform would be unimaginable, partly because nobody would trust them to agree but also because they wouldn't accept the task. Consider the last two holders of the office, and you recall that most former prime ministers, unless like Callaghan and Harold Wilson they opt for withdrawal, focusing mainly on two things: salvaging their reputation, and making a lot of money.  Lady Thatcher is the prime example. Just about every utterance she makes is directed at self-vindication. She travels incessantly abroad, not speaking for Britain as much as promoting herself and filling her pockets. Britain is worth talking about only as an embodiment of Thatch-erite prejudices and values, not for any other quality or any other leader. The lady's vanity knows few limits. Not long ago, asked at a meeting of business people in Texas why the first George Bush hadn't gone into Baghdad to take out Saddam Hussein at the end of the 1991 Gulf war, she replied, to rapturous applause: ""Because I was no longer prime minister.""  That's the measure of the baroness's post-political life. Far from rising above party, she remains an ever-baleful influence upon it, to the plea sure of an ever diminishing circle of people who call themselves Conservatives. Her special gift has not been to the breadth of the nation but the narrowness of a self-created sect, with the brilliant results we now see unfolding in the leadership election.  In his own post-political world, John Major has followed her. No Ford or Carter he. For Major too, money and exoneration seem to be what count. He struggles for an eminence we decline to allow him. The pre-political years of scraping a living are being followed by years of plenty that the old Major could only dream of. He owes every penny of it to what the voters did for him. Yet there's no windfall tax on the benefits from boardroom and memoirs which, without the prime ministership, would not have been available. The tax comes in terms of reputation. These people soon lose most of their credentials to epitomise, at some special level, the national interest. They cease, unfortunately, to be a national asset.  Bill Clinton isn't like Ford or Carter either. For one thing, he's as interested in personal money as any Thatcher. He has bills to pay, and debts to meet, so he must speak and write for money. But a scene took place on Monday that proved how large a figure he still remains, and how available for national duty.  Opening his post-presidential office in Harlem, he was received like a hero. The bands played, and a crowd of 2,000 waited two hours in the sun to see him. He has started to establish an agenda above party politics. One of his biggest themes is the worldwide struggle against Aids, another is the American rural poor, another the empowerment of places like Harlem. The aura of authority and the manifest fact of commitment are not, apparently, undone by the rotten pardons that marked his last days in the White House. He plainly will not fade into civilian life and, as plainly, the nation doesn't want him to.  His reception in Harlem called up memories of another young ex-president. Theodore Roosevelt's second term ended when he was 50. After a year of travelling in Africa and Europe, in 1910 he too landed in New York, receiving, according to his biographer, ""a truly royal welcome"". The harbour was crowded, the city packed, the reception ""like nothing ever given a private citizen coming back to his native land after a brief absence abroad"". In response, Roosevelt remarked that ""the role of sage had no attractions for him, but that he considered it both his privilege and duty to take active part in the discussion of public questions, commending or criticising as his judgment dictated"".  In due course, Roosevelt couldn't restrain himself from going further. He ran   for a third term, an ambition barred to Clinton, much though he would surely like to do it. Their similarities, though, are striking. Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican president who became a Progressive, was plainly an early practitioner of the third way, decades before anyone had heard of Clinton or Tony Blair.   He had the same intense interest in the substance of social reform, cutting through conventional ideological labels. Clinton shares with Roosevelt a passion for engagement and the energy to apply it, together with the quasi-monarchical status that, admittedly, distinguishes an American head of state from a British head of government.  Being still young, Clinton has active years ahead of him as a national figure. He will be accorded special gravitas. Former presidents always are, if they want it. A week before Jimmy Carter handed President Bush the report on election reform, he delivered a scathing attack on several of his policies, notably national missile defence. ""I have been disappointed in almost everything he has done,"" Carter said of Bush. It was an unusual exchange from one president to another. But it did not diminish Carter. Nor was it seen as invalidating what he had to say about elections. We miss that quality in our retired politicians. Our cohorts mostly despatch themselves into cushioned pettiness, fighting old party battles, removed from national service. Where was Ted Heath when you needed him? Sucking up to China, first-class."
1,"The case for the war against Iraq rested on fluctuating rationales. Those of us who opposed it watched with cynical fascination as the words of the statesmen groped for new reasons to suit the predicament they were in. George Bush and Tony Blair had embarked on a policy they could not reverse. At a certain stage, unless Saddam Hussein fled the scene, they were determined to have a war, and finally homed in on two justifications. These had different levels of explicitness. Both now stand in peril of being void. But the failure of one matters a lot more than the other. The failure to find any weapons of mass destruction is becoming an ever bigger deal. Neither 1,000 new US inspectors nor scores of interrogated Iraqi scientists are delivering the goods. It begins to be more possible to believe that most of the bad stuff was destroyed in the 1990s, and that Iraq was telling something like the truth when it claimed to have no weaponised chemical or biological material.  What we're learning more about than caches of weapons of mass destruction are the ferocious wars between politicians and intelligence agencies in the US and UK. For Mr Blair and the military establishment it remains an article of faith that the WMD exist. Blair says that any other outcome would imply a conspiracy by several agencies - the French and German as well as MI6 and the CIA - to lie to their political masters. Yet there is plenty of competing evidence that agencies were leaned on or sidelined by politicians in pursuit of answers that had become politically imperative.  The New Yorker has carried persuasive details of Donald Rumsfeld's creation of a private intelligence group to produce analyses both of the weapons of mass destruction issue and the al-Qaida connection that the CIA's professional scepticism restrained it from delivering. MI6 was seemingly complicit in a crude forgery of documents designed to show that Niger supplied Iraq with nuclear material. Downing Street was willing to stitch together an old academic paper and pretend it was a hot intelligence assessment.  All this happened in support of the WMD thesis, when it was up-front as the leading reason for the war. It was, after all, the only way of conferring legality. A war to enforce UN resolutions came to be defined as the essential link to what was internationally lawful. So the assertion of the presence of WMD in Iraq, even when they had not been discovered, continued as the lynchpin of the public case Bush and Blair made.  The failure of the weapons to turn up is, therefore, embarrassing. It should leave a permanent scar on the credibility of anything any government has to say about war and intelligence. It reminds us that when a war script has been written, the end is taken to justify any political means. But does it now do more than provide sniping material for the critics? Does it matter at the present conjunction of Iraqi events? Not as much as a failure of the second rationale, the ambition for political reform in Baghdad.  At the time, this was seldom made explicit. It filtered through Blair's passionate moralism about creating a decent society, but neither coalition partner talked easily about regime change. Pre-emptive war was a new enough concept, alarming in its implications. Naked intervention to impose a new politics on a sovereign state would have been an outrage too great to admit to. So, at any rate, it seemed to Washington and London. As it certainly did to their critics.  But again, circumstances have to alter judgment. Iraq is where it is. The war was won. Saddam has gone. The high ground, if semi-covert, case of the neo-conservative faction that drove Bush towards this war always was for a regime change that opened the way for Iraq to become some kind of magnetic pole of democracy in the Middle East.  I think that those of us who recoiled from the war on any grounds, and certainly on that one, now need to give its exponents the time to see what can be done. Those who once said the US must never go near Iraq should now urge the US to stay there, with every serious commitment it can muster.  Making the place safe for political freedom is a fantastically ambitious task. We keep being told that George Bush is not a simple man, but he talks about democracy as if it were a commodity ripe for handing over to the ready-made Mesopotamian heirs of Thomas Jefferson. The odds defined by culture and history make the liberal democracy of Iraq an improbable bet in anything less than a decade, if then.  I spent the weekend thinking about this in a different context, at a conference of a fledgling seminar called Ameurus. This is a group brought together by that most fertile animator of such projects, George Weidenfeld, to seek out the common ground between America, Europe and Russia. To hear the Russian speakers, keen democrats all, talk gloomily about human rights and elections and the rule of law was to be reminded how very difficult it is for democracy to penetrate the life and experience of people who are not used to it. Even a society educated in western traditions, knowledgeable in democratic theory, and unencumbered by religious allegiances that challenge it, has a long way to go before becoming a democracy in heart and mind.  In Iraq we've soon seen how unprepared the US was for the ambition it had. It didn't bring policemen, let alone nation-builders. It has not brought elementary order to the streets, and its   first cohort of proconsuls has already been deemed incompetent and sent home. Its clumsiness reveals a Pentagon apparatus better equipped to win a war than contribute to the peace. And don't forget: the builders of the democratic dream were, and are, in the Pentagon.  The message from the early calamities is to reinforce the need for an international approach. Perhaps Mr Blair can play a more effective role than he did before the war, and persuade Washington that what many nations will do for both the reconstruction and the political reform of Iraq is far more important than the effacing of the UN, on which those same Pentagon thinkers seem bent. Their political project has not the slightest hope of working as a unilateral act of imposition.  But they need to be committed. If they're serious about democracy, they'll have to pay for it: 75,000 troops and $20bn a year for several years to stabilise the peace, according to an estimate by the Council on Foreign Relations. They need to learn the subtlety required to preside over the emergence of genuine consultative mechanisms that might lead towards free politics in some sort of federal system. Above all they have to engage the world as leader not hegemon.  These would be hard concessions for the US. They would change the mindset of the Bush administration. But if their priority is as they state, we should now help to hold them to it."
1,"John Smith did not have the chance to be a great leader of the Labour Party. But he was the necessary, probably the inevitable, leader in his time and place. As such he was a brilliant success. Never did a more decent man rise to the top of British politics. He had a rare coherence of morality as well as mind. Although he was a skillful advocate in court, and a wonderful performer in the bear-pit, it was the advocacy of social improvement that came from the core of his being, and here his hierarchy of principles never changed. With unqualified passion, he wanted the betterment of all society, not just part of it. The Scottish belief in community, and in the duty of successful men to advance its case, came as naturally to him as it once came to a certain kind of Tory: the generous, inclusive outlook most public people used to have. It is not too soon to see John Smith as a transitional figure. When the decencies have been done, you can see it right away. He ran a half-modernised Labour Party but he was a man of the old politics, the last survivor of the Callaghan cabinet. Steeped in Labourism, burnished by the swiftness of a clever Scottish lawyer, he asked the party few awkward questions. With the Government in free-fall decline, this comforting style paid dividends. Fate compels the party to look at itself once more, and make a statement about what it is. The necessity for choice will pose essentially two alternatives: carrying forward the momentum towards true modernity, or extending the transitional phase Smith thought sufficient to take Labour into power. By demanding such a debate, John Smith's tragedy need not be the party's catastrophe. Handled sensibly, the contest could yet make Labour a party for which people will vote with enthusiasm rather than the resignation that now widely obtains. It will range the John Prescott against the Tony Blair school of politics, and those men will surely be among the main names in the field, with Gordon Brown and Robin Cook upholding the claims of the Scottish dynasty. For my part, I hope the party thinks deeply about what it means to look forward, not back, and seizes its chance to make the positive appeal John Smith had yet to articulate. The leader matters. The wrong choice could bring disaster in its train. The system, as much as the party, is owed a leader the whole nation can respect. But the state of things is on his side. The leader is dead, long live the leader. Without the 18-month tenure of a brave, accomplished man, that sentiment would have been impossible to set down, except as a sour joke."
1,"All parties agree that ideology is dead. The word is as dirty to Tories battling out the leadership contest as it is to Tony Blair delivering a major speech on public services. And who is not pleased to hear it? But there is a downside. Having no ideology means that all aspects of politics become more perplexing. Government is complicated to do and just as complicated to understand. The silver thread that linked and determined everything has gone. When the defining mantra of the left said public good and private bad, and the right said roughly the opposite, politics was easy to make sense of. Now everything is messier.  While the practice of the trade has eventually had no alternative but to recognise this, public understanding has not caught up. It strives to cling to the old simplicities. The mindset of ideology survives the passing of the ideological age. It's not merely in newspaper headlines, groping for the familiar matrix, that Blairism's plans for public-service delivery are seen as a private-sector takeover. I bet most people in the country see it that way too.  For this the government is largely to blame. In its first term, feeling its way forward, it wasn't straight. It wanted to please all the people all the time, so it tended to reassure the business world with one spin about innovation and competition, while distracting its own constituency with words that said nothing fundamental would change. Its attitude to the health service covered a gamut of promises from tough to tender. Its replacement weapon for ideology was ""what works"". But this became its philosophy well before it knew what worked in either health or education. It knew that what the Tories had done, especially in the NHS, did not work, but was far from sure how to replace it.  There remains a lot of confusion. Important differences are still not widely apprehended, partly because ministers' own schemes reflect the complication of post- ideological government, and partly because producer unions want to make things seem more threatening than they are. Enlisting private-sector skills and money to develop surgical centres or improve failing schools is not the same as privatisation.  Very little of the public sector is capable of being run by the private sector in any case. Instituting regimes of competition or ""contestability"", a practice common in the public sectors of France, Germany, Holland and other continental models, isn't an assault on public-service principles but a minimal necessity for raising them to the best-practice levels everyone is entitled to expect.  Yesterday, Mr Blair got closer to clarifying some of this than he has done before. It was the most important speech he has made since the election. Though the news line will be his commitment not to ""flinch"" from producer union opposition, the real message was a more cogent invitation than ever before to move out of the ideological box. Some of the unions believe he is thirst ing for a fight, even looking for a demonstration combat such as Mrs Thatcher had with the miners. Actually his words sounded as though they came from the last-chance saloon of the British version of social democracy, which has rather suddenly woken up to the danger of its core proposition being seen to fail.  It was a sobering not a militant address. The case it made chimes with the experience of most people who use public services of every kind, which tells them that while more money is absolutely necessary, it is not necessarily sufficient, and that reform is essential if delivery is going to improve. This was an inaugural moment for the second term in another way as well. It put into operation the vow of plodding, responsible realism with which Mr Blair said he would replace the ever-deceptive spinning that was the leitmotif of 1997-2001. As such it sent three signals.  First, the government has no single plan for public services. There is no Great Blueprint, the temptation towards which it was lured in the first term. Compared with some of its first-term rhetoric, the glorification of the private has actually receded. There are different answers for differ ent problems. If more than half of local education authorities are described by Ofsted as either fairly or very successful, as they are, the sweeping abolition favoured by some reformers makes no sense. It makes as little sense to insist that only NHS units may tender to run the new surgical centres just because they are being set up as a supplement to NHS hospitals.  A senior trade unionist told me yesterday he was sceptical of ministers' ability to get down to the detail of reform. They were, he said, more at home talking about, and endlessly revising, their fancy institutional structures than with the tedious practicalities. He also regretted the adversarial - anti-union - subtext that seemed to have made its way into the discourse. But Blair avoided that. His real subtext was that, at a time of peace and high employment, no task of government is in greater public demand than making essential public services, the base material of a functioning society, work properly.  Second, it is without doubt true that only a social democratic government has a chance of doing this. Only the party with an incontestable belief in the primacy of public services can be trusted to reform their delivery in ways that do not merely profit private business and ultimately deprive the less advantaged members of society. As a matter of fact, this belief may be a little more widespread than it was: another victory, perhaps, for a new spirit of the times. Two of the candidates for the Tory party leadership make almost everything of their commitment to health and education, and admit that it was failure in this field that contributed most to the public's hatred of their party at the election.  But the third candidate might yet win. Iain Duncan Smith is the voice of the hard Tory right, which flirts with the minimal state, and much of which favours an American-style approach. With that line, IDS would be even less likely than Michael Portillo or Kenneth Clarke to win the next election. But the state of Conservatism makes plain the danger that, without visible improvements brought about by progressive politicians, the public sector will become the source of yet deeper cynicism and despair.  Thirdly, though, the challenge is in one sense impossible to meet. Blair said yesterday that it was ""as great as any that has faced a postwar government"". We have to be aware that he has staked everything on outcomes that will, in many people's eyes, never be satisfactory. The famous glass, whether in school or hospital, is always in danger of being half-empty. If the world economy, dragging Britain's with it, faces a prolonged downturn, not even the prudence of Mr Brown will have been enough to preserve the required budget surplus.  All one can say at the moment is that Mr Blair has set out, without glamour or spin, on the defining stage of his engagement with the realities the people most value. Even that is worth saying, however - and worth supporting."
1,"Urging us to start a debate about tax is a strange thing to find as the centre-piece of a Labour chancellor's agenda. Isn't that one of the main questions political choice was always supposed to be about? Gordon Brown unfurls the issue after seven years spent keeping it tightly wrapped. Not having the debate has been at the heart of his political strategy. Such silence about a key mechanism of what we used to call socialism has been apparent all round the western world, a by-product of the left-right stasis that settled over the 1990s. But nowhere was the possibility of a pro-tax position further beyond the pale than in the realm of New Labour.  In Britain, Mr Brown and Mr Blair implied, the issue was settled. Thatcherism had established the new norm, from which they would not depart. Their commitment against higher direct tax rates, and their decision to freeze public spending for the first two years, were meant to close down the fundamental argument. In reality, all kinds of taxes were pushed up. There was a welcome shift on another left-right axis, the pattern of redistribution. But debate was precisely what was not allowed. These things happened by stealth. Any possibility that public opinion might favour higher taxes openly proposed was too alarming to put to the test. It might tear apart the image of a reformed Labour party. Political convenience dictated that debate should not occur.   Now political convenience says differently. The leaders invite a discussion because they see the need to raise taxes, including perhaps direct taxes, which they've previously promised not to touch. Moreover, a cynic might say, they've loaded the outcome in their favour. Some public services have reached such a depth of inadequacy, in the fourth largest economy in the world, that there can be no case against greater public spending, or therefore higher tax. We've been living for five years in the middle of a social experiment that might have been designed to prove that the low-tax, low-spend aspirations of Thatcherism had finally to be contested. It's unnerving to think that the impoverishment of the NHS may be the only way a progressive party could get its case across. But that has surely helped precipitate Mr Brown's uncharacteristic request for a debate.   Meanwhile something else has been happening. The argument may at last be urgent, but it will be harder to have. There's a new dimension since the early days of Mr Blair. Public confidence in politicians seems to be steadily declining. The latest survey of British Social Attitudes (18th report, National Centre for Social Research) asked some questions about political engagement and trust, mainly to explore why apathy has reached such depths as were registered by the deplorable turnout at the last election. The verdict does not look good for a genuine tax debate.   In some ways, the British prove to be less apathetic than is commonly assumed. The survey, which is more meticulous than any opinion poll, produces figures that could persuade one there's plenty of life in the democratic dog yet. Though turnout is low, and interest in parliament in decline, engagement with public issues by other means is on the rise. Petition-signing, media-contacting, street protesting and even writing to an MP have grown markedly in the last 15 years. Many millions of us evidently still care about things beyond our precious lifestyles.   But to enlist us in a serious debate about higher taxation is to presume a reasonable level of trust in politicians to spend the proceeds well, and such trust seems to be in tatters. This is the only conclusion to draw from a wider measurement of confidence that was tested in a question asking whether people trusted British governments of any persuasion to place the needs of the nation above the interests of their own political party. Only 16% said they did so ""just about always"" or ""most of the time"". This is less than half the percentage (39) that said the same in 1974. The trust gauge steadily declined over three decades, with an upward blip to 29 in 1998, followed by the present abysmal figure, which implies a near halving of trust over the life thus far of the Blair government.   Whatever ministers say, in other words, the voters are becoming ever less inclined to believe in their selfless concern for the national interest. In particular, one may reasonably infer, if they say they want more of voters' money, they will face deep mistrust about how the proceeds will be used. Actually, another survey in a different context showed that, if asked the right way, people say they're willing to pay higher tax, including income tax. Last year's Fabian Society commission of inquiry into tax came up with old-fashioned, even socialistic, answers. But they were conditional on the belief that ministers can be trusted to give consumers of public services a better deal. An earmarked tax-rise for the NHS got 80% support.   Public desperation is already changing the context. Anxiety levels about health and transport in particular have now reached new peaks. Slowly but inexorably, the inviolable sanctity of the NHS as presently conceived is being challenged by intolerable waiting-lists and death-rates few other European countries suffer. The need for private money, essentially from the users of the service, subject to every kind of necessary means test, will become more glaring. Equally, the railway system cannot survive without public-private partnerships, organised on a basis that corrects the biggest scandal of the Major government, its rush to privatise at whatever price as long as the ideological pledge was met.   So the voters are ready for reform. They want to see investment and delivery on a level France and Germany regard as routine. Some of this will be with private money. But they're also ready for more public investment. What they await is a government that can break through the familiar contradiction, found in every survey on the subject, which reveals most respondents wanting better services and lower taxes at the same time, the Gordian knot that Gordon now seeks help in cutting. The apparent challenge is to his arithmetic. But the real one is to his credibility. How can he persuade the country that their taxes really are worth paying?   For in a sense, the debate is already over. Better services, in these elementary parts of civilised life, have now become such a paramount need that they've transcended the pressure for lower tax. We are a European not an American society, and demand the outcomes, if not always the methods, of social democracy. The demonstration effect of five years' Labour government has been, ironically, to prove the urgency of that priority by failing to deliver it.   What we know about political alienation is that much the greatest withdrawal of trust is due to the breaking of promises and the failure of delivery. Most other things, as the BSA survey suggests, are chaff in the media wind. So Gordon's discussion of forbidden subjects may be interesting. But not as a mask for what politicians should be doing, and are widely seen not to have done."
1,"In Washington, as well as Europe, Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary at the Pentagon, is regarded as the most awesome of hawks in his appetite for a war to overthrow Saddam Hussein. A Republican senator I interviewed on a recent visit saw him as a weirdo whose views were so dogmatic as to put him outside the realms of normal debate. In Bob Woodward's new book, Bush at War, an essential revelatory text, Wolfowitz is reported as arguing from the start that the right response to 9/11 would be an attack on Iraq - ""a brittle, oppressive regime that might break easily"" - rather than an invasion of Afghanistan risking 100,000 US troops in unwinnable mountain combat. I asked him about hawkishness in a conversation yesterday in London, and notably his well-known opposition to sending UN inspectors on a futile mission to search out Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. ""I'm well known for lots of things,"" he said drily. He comes over just now as a hawk on his best behaviour. But he doesn't think inspection has a chance of success without a fundamental change of Iraqi attitude. There was no way every computer hard-disc and every home-stored piece of poison could be simply unearthed. ""This isn't a country where we've had lots of human intelligence tunnelling like crazy for years and years,"" he said.  Nor is the Pentagon working to the same time limit as the inspectors have declared. Last week, their spokesman said it would take at least a year before inspection had a chance of calling itself complete. It would take much less time, said Wolfowitz, ""to decide if we look like going down one track or the other"". As to what the test might be, as between peace and war, he resists any request to specify one. He thinks journalists are too eager to ask about trigger-events, when in fact, according to him, there is no blueprint for a war decision.  The leaders, he says, will have to make the choice. ""They're not going to make it on the basis of a predetermined line that's been crossed, and somehow says the hour has come. They will have to make a judgment, balancing the positive and negative evidence."" This was Wolfowitz in soothing mode, ceaselessly deferential to the president whose September decision to go to the UN was a defeat for the hawks. The question is: when will they be back?  The secretary was here to give a lecture, whose main substance changed the subject from Iraq to Washington's urgent request to the Europeans to bring Turkey into the EU. Turkey is a key ally in any war coalition against Saddam, but the American purpose is wider, namely to secure the absorption of a moderate Muslim state into the political organisation of western Christendom, which is one reason why France, Germany and Spain, to name but three, are unenthusiastic, though Britain, as ever, is taking the American view. Wolfowitz's argument is important, and   the case was well made - but this wasn't what the audience assembled by the International Institute for Strategic Studies had come to hear.  On Iraq, he didn't say enough for them. And Iraq presents an unusual British problem. The war proposition is one on which our prime minister is well ahead not only of his own party but also of the network of defence intellectuals, politicos and mandarins assembled by the IISS. Here was a group of non-Labourish, often rather conservative figures waiting to be persuaded out of their scepticism by a famous prince of darkness. But I think he failed to satisfy them, because he was talking with unnatural reticence.   He did make a vivid case for pre-emptive strikes against the possessor of so many weapons of mass destruction who has a record of putting them to criminally hideous use against his own people. Taking the 3,000 victims of 9/11 as a benchmark, were we to ""wait until 30,000 Americans, or 300,000 or perhaps three million had been killed by WMD before we felt free to act against them""? John F Kennedy's conduct of the Cuban missile crisis, facing down such threats, was Wolfowitz's model. Forty years on, in a world without state-based enemies, ""imminent"" threats were so indecipherable, it seemed, that any hypothetical threat now justified pre-emption.  The issue he did not address in detail was how the Iraqi threat connected with the war on existing terrorism as experienced in New York, Bali and Mombasa. Here was the hawkish disappointment of the day. After all, Wolfowitz is leader of the school that says the link between Saddam and al-Qaida justifies a war if and when the inspection process fails, yet he produced no evidence of a connection even after 15 months to find it. Even at this time, in front of this audience, he did no more than insist that the US military could fight on many fronts, disregarding the argument that bothers Europeans, including many well-informed Brits. To them the issue isn't whether both wars can be fought simultaneously, but whether fighting Iraq won't enhance rather than defeat the forces available to al-Qaida.  From these encounters, the lecture and the conversation, I draw two conclusions. One is that the US has no doubt about the virtue of its cause, as seen not only at home but also in Iraq. This confirmed what I kept hearing in Washington. Many important people there have a clear belief that the Iraqi street, not to mention the Iraqi middle class, is simply waiting the signal to rise up and welcome their liberators. Officials at the National Security Council are counting the civil servants they're quite sure will turn in a trice to run the country the American way.  The official American line is, in a way, simplistic. Perhaps it has to be. Americans understand the war may be hard to win, especially if it reduces to an urban battle for every street in Baghdad. But they cannot believe they might be less popular than the regime they will replace. The sense of a democratic future for Iraq, its 23 million educated citizens cohering round a new prosperity and being transformed from the pariah to the role model in the Middle East, reveals the power of optimistic fantasy to sweep aside all difficulties.  My second conclusion is darker. When I asked Paul Wolfowitz whether we should be preparing for a war the UN did not bless, he avoided the question. He said, as per routine, that there was an outside chance Saddam would see the light, and let inspection lead to the peaceful dismembering of his weaponry. But he doesn't believe it is going to happen. Nor does any American I've met anywhere near the administration. They are going through the necessary motions of peace. They might even believe what they used to reject, that regime-change could occur that way. The hawk yesterday talked a subtle game, submissive to politicians ""above my pay grade"". But in September at the UN, he only lost a battle. The war is another matter."
1,"The government reshuffle made a lot of column mileage. Covering it was a journalistic duty, the journey being fuelled by many practitioners of the politician's trade, whose whispers became a form of necessary news. The large truth is that it will barely matter. Hardly anyone outside politics has reason to give a damn about the unchanged cabinet. This is not mere summer ennui, however. It states a truth about the uniquely unpolitical state of modern politics. The truth, murmured but unelaborated, is that there may not be enough talent for Mr Blair to choose from. He worries about this. The word from his circle is that there are too few stars making an irresistible case for promotion. What's left of the reshuffle is designed to test this proposition. The lower ranks - hoisting first-time ministers from the ranks of backbench Blairites - were always going to be more suggestive than the fate of old sweats by the names of Cunningham and Beckett and Mowlam. With luck, some stars will reveal themselves. Very possibly, however, Mr Blair is chasing a chimera of his own making.  For how does a politician become a star? When is he or she big? What is the route to mattering? Unless they look like making a difference, they can never hope to be heavy hitters. Yet the style of the Blairite hegemony is designed to produce the opposite kind of political creature. Last night's bet on stasis was further evidence of it.   Previous Labour governments were not short of big politicians. There were the usual obscure middle-weights, but there were also Castle, Healey, Benn, Jenkins. They were people of substance, who made a difference. They tended to be listened to. Why? Partly, no doubt, because they were the cream of the progressive crop. In their time politics was the highest pursuit a leftist could aspire to. There was academe and the civil service, but there were no consultancies, no lobbyists, no media that might satisfy such a person as a proxy for politics and a back-passage to power.  Yet there was another reason for these leaders' weight. They were independent spirits. They stood for something. A factionalised party produced factional chiefs who rose to prominence by argument, and remained there because of the portions of power they were seen to wield. Quite apart from her persuasive talents, Barbara Castle was a political force whom Harold Wilson could not ignore: ditto Tony Benn with Jim Callaghan. Roy Jenkins became a major politician, both prop and menace to Wilson, partly because it was recognised, at different moments, that he might soon be leader himself.  The politics of faction is the culture that Mr Blair has sworn to exorcise from the modern Labour party. He has already paid a price for it, and will deserve to pay more. We learn that political weight - the star quality he apparently misses - has some thing to do with political menace; some connection with independent credibility; some dimension of awkward separateness.  The same was evident under Mrs Thatcher. When Geoffrey Howe moved out from under her unchallenged command, he finally became a politician to reckon with in his own right. A colourless disciple, it is true, was chosen as her successor. But throughout the Tory period it was the ministers who stood for something often oblique to what the leader preferred - Clarke and Heseltine are good examples - and then became proven risk-takers for positions they believed in, who stayed in the heavy-hitting league.  The operational principle of Blairism is quite different. Such characters are not allowed, let alone encouraged. There are ministers who in their youth shared a platform with Tony Benn, but their self-validation as new Labour lies in the abjectness with which they watched their past draining out of them. Not only is faction banned and rebellion unthinkable, but evidence of an independent mind is proffered with caution - and then only by cabinet ministers exceptionally sure of their position.   This is a matter of circumstance as well as character. The demands for uniform spin have a mighty power to suppress discussion, let alone disagreement. The end of ideology has a similar fall-out on the system. The absence of faction, and therefore of the sub-potentates whose power came from faction, reflects a paucity of the issues around which the old doctrinal fury used to rage.  A good thing too, say Blair and his friends. Here we have a united party, shining eyes fixed on the progressive millennium, able to report all 177 manifesto pledges on course for keeping. Isn't GB plc doing well? Besides, don't voters hate a divided party? Isn't it for this reason that the famous second term, which eluded all those warring titans of the sixties and seventies, looks a near certainty?  Maybe. But the future political class look a rather threadbare lot. That is the way they are being formed and trained. The voters may eventually punish chronic division, but they don't admire a party of neutered robots, which is what Blairism requires its backbench politicians to be: as they're about to find out yet again, with the Millbank verdicts on their fidelity, and the Millbank invitation to constituencies to take action against back- sliders who have dared to show a sign of independence.  There are some able people in this government. But the climate doesn't encourage them to show that they are potent politicians. When Blairite insiders say that David Blunkett is able, they mean he has shown the will to do, as efficiently as possible, what the leader wants. When they say that Robin Cook has recovered from a bad start to become an important player, they mean he conducted Kosovo well, and now understands that his future lies entirely in mirroring Blair rather than posing as a threat to him. The fate of Mr Cook, once an independent force in the party, illustrates better than anything what has happened since the days when Harold Wilson fumed to Benn that Jenkins was about to unhorse him. As a politician, Mr Cook, like everyone else, seems to have little clout left.  The test of quality, instead of being political, is administrative, though with a side-glance at the sub-political art of media performance. Has the minister made progress with enough of the 177 items in the company prospectus? This is the benchmark question for the Blair project. All the cabinet evidently passed it. But if political stars are to reappear, it is the wrong question. It kills political talent. What the regime prefers are men in suits whose words will never sing, and women whose command of bullet-points ensures a reliable absence of imagination. None of them are meant to carry menace or even interest. That is why it's hard to care whether Cunningham came or went, or Ruth Sycophant is promoted under-secretary for bicycle bells."
1,"When Ronald Reagan dies, will Dan Rather wear a black tie? Unlikely. Will American television newsmen be cursed from one end of the print media to the other for their sartorial disrespect? Out of the question. When Reagan dies, Americans will behave with respectful maturity. There will be a big funeral, and many television obituaries. But there will be no collective nervous breakdown over the finer details of the obsequies. That is because Americans have much to teach the British about a healthy attitude to the past. Reagan, the defiant British may reply, is not royal. He was only a temporary piece of history. He came and went, and held no constitutional role after his presidency. He disappeared, lost to the public mind as thoroughly as Alzheimer's claimed his own mind from himself. Yet Reagan was a head of state. He did enormous things, helping to change world history. He merits far more reflective consideration by the American body politic than the Queen Mother does by the British. But there will be no national frenzy if he's judged by some people not to be getting enough.  Reagan's death will take its place in the scheme of things. Americans have a reverence for their past, but not an obsession with its power to guide the present. They know their history, cultivate their heroes. Washington has a selection of monuments commemorating the greatest of them. They take care of their historic sites, especially those that mark the civil war. Sometimes they seem to want a longer history, and come to Europe looking keenly for it: marvelling at medieval cathedrals, searching for roots.  But for most Americans, the past gets in the way of the future. They look backwards as much in apprehension as celebration. They think hard about the lessons of disaster, such as slavery and Vietnam. The old preoccupation of the American psyche with isolation from the entanglements of the world lives on. But history does not infuse everything they do. Respect for history is not a precondition of contemporary action. The past does not suck them in, preoccupy them, define their sense of self. Hardly any American ever says how much better life was 30, let alone 100, years ago. It's a sentiment I've never heard expressed there. There is rather little nostalgia in America.  The British are still different. Here the national psyche is inextricably defined by the past, the period of national greatness that has gone. For some people, clinging to the past is a way of remembering that life undoubtedly was better however many decades ago. The past and its icons seem to supply the strategies by which we stoically remind ourselves that things, alas, can never be the same again.  The Queen Mother's death expressed that. But what did so even more were the arguments about how it should be talked about. These revealed some deep insecurities. The worry was not just about the tone of the commentary but, underlying it, the very future of the monarchy. Was sufficient respect being deployed? Was the timelessness - the unchangeability - of Britain being adequately recognised? Were we still in touch with that great country where the army was once powerful, the people knew their place, and respect for authority was reliable and might, if only that queenly world could be rediscovered, still be so.  The British dream, whereby the past is required to infuse the present, has not, even in modern times, always been a fantasy. There's something fitting in the coincidence that the Queen Mother died, unleashing all these passions, in the week when memories of the Falklands war are doing the same. The war is relished, if at all, not so much for its contentious substance but the fact that it happened. It proved that the days of imperial duty were not entirely gone. We did it. The 20th anniversary is marked by poignant, sometimes angry, analysts getting to grips with the awful fact that Britain could never do that kind of thing again.  Whether these longings, or this wallowing in the past, reflect the majority mood of Britain is debatable. Each side in the argument claims the nation for itself, but especially those who make the fullest-throated case for honouring the past. My own impression of most people, when they think about the Queen Mother, is that they do not engage with much of this argument. They don't reflect the Guardian letters column, an atypical fount of bile. They soberly recall a pretty admirable old lady, who lived to 101 and did service to the nation, but then they move on. They mark her departure politely, while remembering that she was hardly more of a monarch than Ronald Reagan.  The political class, in which the media should always be included, are another matter. The charge and counter-charge that this very normal death has prompted are more fatuous than in any political argument I can ever recall. The disproportion between the facts and the response seem to reveal editors and columnists who have lost the last shreds of a sense of scale. Their righteous rage at the BBC could not have been greater if the person of the Queen herself had been violated by Greg Dyke. Betrayal has been the word of the week. The betrayal of the people by the BBC is matched only by the betrayal of Falklands veterans by the MoD, when it calmly says it is accustomed to celebrating 25th but not 20th anniversaries of battles large and small.  Modernity does creep in here. The foaming rage of the Daily Mail is part of a topical agenda, to do with trying to dismantle the BBC. We learn that in fact the Royal Family were not at all furious with the way the BBC performed. Prince Charles himself said so. One would suppose not, given the vast output the corporation has set aside on all channels.  Mendacious venom, however, is not troubled by tedious truth, when commercial rivalries are being conducted behind a sanctimonious debate about what is and is not proper. It's hard to imagine the Times, under any other ownership, actually leading Tuesday's paper with a headline about Peter Sissons' tie, reinforced with pious little pictures showing what a good little black-tied boy the Sky presenter had been compared with the burgundy hooligans on BBC1. There are many subliminal routes towards establishing the fake parity of respect that Sky would dearly love to claim.  But essentially the passion is not modern. It is the old British disease raised to new levels of hysteria: of fear for the passing of the past; of sentiment that's always in danger of overspilling into every corner of British life. This is a country that still finds in the past a place of safety. While nobody would want to forget history and still less, of course, undo it, what is better worth remembering is that history can be a curse. In Britain more than most countries, it has been the enemy of the future. Now that our oldest embodiment of history has been gathered, perhaps her finest epitaph would be that she marked the beginning of the end of that affliction."
1,"Ministers are public people. That is their uniqueness. What they do is speak for the state. They may be parents, and they may be viewers, but these are secondary characteristics, which may add to their claim to be human beings but can be distractions from their main function.  When reacting to public events, they deserve attention only in their public role. Faced in the last week by two challenges to their capacity for speedy judgment - those swift uncalculated words that tell so much - they responded by exposing some pretty sinister instincts among those who command the British public realm.  This is not a party point. The degeneration that has unfolded under Mr Blair builds on that which was well developed under Thatcherism. Maybe it's characteristic of governments everywhere. But seldom has there been such a revealing mismatch of responses, such a woeful reaction to two events that had in common the fact that television encompassed them.   In the case of Brass Eye, the programme satirising anti-paedophile hysteria, ministers put on display their incorrigible capacity for intervention. They seem to be incapable of shutting up, or of observing the elementary rules that might entitle them not to, and this film could of course not be allowed to pass. David Blunkett sent word from his holiday that he was ""dismayed"" by the programme, which he had not seen. One of his deputies, Beverley Hughes, called it ""unspeakably sick"", again without having seen it; and, when challenged 24 hours later by Jim Naughtie, was defiant in her determination not to see it, even though sending for a video might have been considered a prudent manoeuvre if   she was to go on braying about the scandal of it ever being shown.   Tessa Jowell, the culture minister, was a little more careful. She saw the programme, but plainly failed to see its point, and found another way of saying that it should have been stopped. As secretary of state, she was alive to the danger of direct censorship, but spent yesterday putting the arm on the Independent Television Commission to perform that task instead. Why hadn't the ITC stopped the show being repeated? she whinged. There ought to be a law. There needed to be a system whereby the censor intervened quickly, if enough complaints clocked up. She would be urgently inventing such a system. This must stop. And so on.   I thought the programme was a failure. The satire was too deeply embedded in the shock effect to make much sense. Some stupid personalities were conned into appearing on it. But it had a point, which survived many levels of scrutiny at Channel 4. Is the volume of viewers' complaints to be the touchstone for acceptability? If it is, a mere 2,500 complaints out of a viewership of some millions, though large by historic standards, surely ask a question about the rights of the silent majority. Above all, this is nothing to do with ministers. The worse the programme, the more important it is to remember that point, if we still believe in a television regime that aspires not to take the state-controlled public-private monopolies of Silvio Berlusconi as its model.   In any case, these interventions seem to be very selective. Confronted by pictures of unparalleled police brutality from Genoa, ministers did not react so fiercely. They seemed to be not at all shocked. Neither as viewers nor as parents did they have anything to say to the evidence before their eyes that young people, including quite a lot of Brits, were systematically beaten up by various branches of the Italian state apparatus.    Conceivably it was excusable for Mr Blair to react as he did to the opening scenes of this encounter, which happened while he was still in Genoa. In saying that he supported the Italians' efforts to stop the G8 meeting being wrecked, he made a necessary case for peaceful international diplomacy. But then things turned brutally unpleasant from the other side, with credible statements by innocent British people that at least deserved the status of evidence to be believed or refuted.   At that stage our prime minister, as far as I have traced, said nothing. Our foreign secretary, after a two-day delay, came out with the bloodless assertion that the Italians should inquire into what happened, and the promise that, if the victims could marshal a case against the carabinieri who had beaten them black and blue, it would be forwarded to Rome.   The premise at work here is a long way from the assumption that lies behind the onslaught on Brass Eye. One set of images, sight unseen, attracts ministers' maximum intolerance. The other, featuring criminal behaviour by another government, achieves only their acquiescence. Peter Hain, the one minister who talked about ""the over- reaction from the police"" in Genoa, soon had the ground removed from under him by Mr Straw. The state fell over itself not to be appalled, even conditionally, by what had palpably happened in Genoa: the beating of non-violent protesters by a quasi-fascist police force. On the other hand, it was ready with instant condemnation of a television programme it had no locus to attack.   Is television to be free of government control, or is it not? Ministers set the rules of ownership and create the regulatory regime. Ofcom, which is about to take that task, will be one of the most powerful public bodies in the country. But ministers   should legislate, then withdraw. When Chris Smith was culture minister, he found such restraint impossible. He was forever interfering, especially with the BBC. He thought nothing of telling them to lay off the costume dramas in favour of more gritty television, or exploding with rage over the supremely unimportant issue of the scheduling of the nightly television news. He talked about liberty in one breath, and challenged it in the next.   The Blunkett-Jowell intervention over Brass Eye is in the same spirit. It speaks for a ministeriat that thinks it must say something about everything, especially when the tabloids are baying. It can't see any social imperfection, such as a tasteless TV programme, without reaching for a new law to deal with it. To say it cannot recognise irony or satire is perhaps to offer counsel of unreasonable perfection. But to charge this collective governmental spirit with dislike for other people's freedom, whether as creators or receivers, is to say no more than the tedious, deadening, sanctimonious truth.   Yet the spirit has a darker side. Swift to intervene in what does not matter, it's unwilling to recognise what does. I have no doubt Mr Blair sincerely believed in Genoa that his duty was to defend the Italian authorities. But then the evidence changed, and neither he nor Straw could summon a single heartfelt phrase of indignation on behalf of their own citizens with a prima facie case against Berlusconi's government. For this was diplomacy not paedophilia. In that arena, state power is quick to recognise its own. Where there was caution there should have been fire, and where there was fire, caution. Such are the priorities of a government that finds it easier to rage against paedophilia than defend the freedoms of its citizens abroad, when television stakes out the ground."
1,"For all his scripted dumbness, George Bush is the voice of America. He manages to be loud and anxious at the same time. When he speaks his own words they often sound evasive and uncomprehending. But his is the only voice there seems to be. He is, after all, the president. Through him and the handful of his ministers regularly heard from - which means, in effect, the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and almost no one else - we get a monochrome picture of the US: an America defiant, haughty and contemptuous towards both dissenters at home and, mitigated by the softenings of the secretary of state, Colin Powell, other governments that do not agree with the Bush line abroad. The dominance of this tone is surprising. Had it not been for the 9/11 crime against America last year, Bush would surely not get away with it. That remembered horror shelters him from the truth that an election he did not win fair and square should have induced a subtler humility. What is even more striking than the president's strident emptiness, however, is the absence of competing voices with a different philosophy.  The American system does not provide for a leader of the opposition. But it is still eerie to watch most aspirant leaders of the Democrats, preparing for an election contest with Bush in 2004, taking their tone from him rather than posing a frontal challenge to it. They gripe about the huge Republican tax cut for the rich and middle rich, and rail against corporate corruption. But they throttle back. They have to be careful. Many Democrats as well as Republicans took poisoned money from Enron and WorldCom.  Al Gore jockeys for position. Amazingly, he is the frontrunner, despite the fiasco of a campaign he ran in 2000 that let Bush in. He is hardly ever heard from, sidling away from confrontation and weighing up whether the polls will let him run. A handful of senatorial possibles - John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, John Edwards - circle around, daring to say almost nothing, propelled, it seems, by terror of the Bush hard right more than the fury these incumbents deserve from any Democrat.  To find a fiercer rigour, one needs to travel north. Vermont is a small state, and its governor, Howard Dean, not yet a national figure. But he is the one declared candidate for the presidency, and is now embarked on the long haul to 2004, with a package of positions that define him as a realist but, more important, a style with the declaratory conviction that separates him from all those guarded poll-watchers. He sounds like a Clinton third wayer without the torment. Could this be the voice that, if heard often enough, will at least remind Americans that Bush's incoherent nationalism and vested interest economics are not the only message they need put up with?  ""I'm much more conservative than President Bush on money,"" Mr Dean told me. Bush's failure to balance the budget, ""with $200bn deficits as far as the eye can see"", was the mistake of a profligate Reaganite believer in ""voodoo supply-side economics"". No Republican had balanced the budget since Richard Nixon. Dean, governor for 11 years, has balanced the Vermont budget with the messianic rigour of a Gordon Brown. Bush's failure to do the same puts America, he says, in the same category as an IMF defaulter. ""This federal government is no more responsible than Argentina,"" he declared.  Vermont is the most liberal state in the union, but this does not sound like a knee-jerk Vermonter. There was more in conservative vein. Dean gets an A rating from the National Rifle Association because he says gun law is a local not a federal matter, and naturally does not oppose hunting in his rural state. A liberal would also find him unsound on the death penalty, which he once opposed but now favours for child murderers and killers of on-duty policemen. Nobody, I guess, can win the presidency as an open opponent of capital punishment. Dean's shift, he says, was a tough call, ""but I've made my call and that's what I'm going to stick with"". It was the one moment in our conversation when I sensed an uneasy political calculator at work.  But now comes the liberal realism. Against the evidence of polls, Dean signed the first American state law allowing gay civil unions. At the crest of his record is health insurance, the domestic issue that worries Americans more than any other. More than 90% of Vermonters, including virtually all children, are covered, something the governor, who happens to be a qualified doctor, believes he knows how to bring to the country as a whole. He is convinced that health insurance with a balanced budget could be a winning ticket among middle Americans, who ""want to hear from someone who's not timid about the direction the country should take, and is not about nuances and shades of difference"".  His fiercest dissent from Bush is on foreign affairs. Where Bush had famously seldom been abroad before entering the White House, Dean has visited 60 countries. He has an entirely different vision of America's role in the world. ""Bush has said we shouldn't be engaged in nation building,"" he said. ""I think we must."" America had the duty to be a good world citizen, which it was not being. Here I heard a defence of cultural imperialism that would make this governor a more natural soulmate of our interventionist Mr Blair than Bush could ever be. He sees America's role as being a long-haul presence in Middle East societies, which need to become ""middle-class democracies"". He thinks Bush should invade Iraq only if he can show, as Kennedy did in Cuba, irrefutable evidence of the enemy's nuclear and/or biological weaponry, and if he explains to America that this will be a 10-year, nation-building commitment.  As for the allies, he seems to regard the EU as a wonder of the modern world, to be cherished not abused. ""In a short period of time, the most dangerous continent on earth has been made into the most stable,"" he said.  ""This president has the capacity to do more harm to America than any other individual,"" Dean said. ""For the first time we have a man in the White House who can neither manage economic affairs prudently nor foreign affairs wisely."" The governor will struggle to make himself heard.  He does not yet have big money. He comes from the wrong kind of state - though both Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter made it from small constituencies, and four of the past five presidents have been governors not senators. Possibly Howard Dean's greatest virtue is that he can speak. He has a voice. It is orderly, clear and unagonised. It says if you want an alternative that is truer than Bush to the great American dream of standing for a better world, here he is. There are worse beginnings for a candidacy."
1,"Scouting the tundra that is New Labour, some Tories claim to know where it will break up. They think the issue will be Europe. Iain Duncan Smith is running his leadership bid on that misguided fantasy. Actually, the real fault line is about as uncomfortable for him as for Tony Blair. We see the beginnings of it in the Greenpeace escapades at Menwith Hill. For two days running, demonstrators broke past dozy guards at the American listening post in Yorkshire to make their point against national missile defence. It has been a perfect gesture: well-organised, attention-getting and sparking into life an argument the government was hoping to suppress. It also signals a contest in which the anaesthetic sibilance of New Labour will face its hardest struggle to put the instincts of the old left to sleep.  Unlike Europe, NMD strikes at the living heart and mind of Labour. As an issue of principle, Europe is dead. The socialist souls it stirs are barnacled with age. George Bush's missile defence schemes, by contrast, draw conscience and politicstogether to demand a statement about the modern world. Here the argument has only just begun. NMD's presumptions about the post-cold-war world challenge the European left to think seriously.  Mr Bush ended his recent visit apparently thinking he had it licked. Such was the briefing from spokesmen and spinners, especially in Washington and London. Europe, we were led to believe, agreed that there were missile threats from rogue states, and did not fundamentally oppose the US in its efforts to counteract them. The phrase ""moral imperative"" was even attributed to one European power, believed to be not a million miles from Madrid. The strategists, both political and military, of the Republican right sustain the assertion that, come what may, NMD is irreversible, will go ahead and - a more recent promise - will be deployed whether or not it has been proved to work.  The imperative has become political. ""It is a simple question,"" the June 9 Washington Post quoted a Pentagon official as saying. ""Is something better than nothing? The president and the secretary for defence have made it pretty clear that some missile defence in the near term is in fact better than nothing."" The definition of near term appears to be set just before the end of Bush's first term as president.  The European response is in fact more fragmented, more aware than ever of the fragility of some of the claims coming out of the ultra-hawkish Pentagon, and the plethora of defence businesses that would be the only unambiguous gainers from NMD. There's a seamlessness between the Bush and Clinton missile programmes, and more evidence appearing of the critiques that were made of the Clinton approach even from within his administration.  In a telling piece in the new issue of Foreign Affairs, John Newhouse, who worked in the Clinton State Department, pours scorn on the threat-analysis that persuaded Clin ton he needed ""red meat thrown to the rightwingers on the [Capitol] Hill"". North Korea and Iran were depicted as capable, within a few years, of threatening the US with strategic missile systems. ""But within and beyond the administration,"" writes Newhouse, ""as well as within the intelligence bureaucracy itself, the threat was widely seen as greatly inflated."" It reminded him of the later 1970s, ""when cold warriors in and out of government exaggerated the strength of Soviet strategic forces, in part by intimidating the intelligence community and skewing the intelligence product.""  The key player in both the late 70s and late 90s was Donald Rumsfeld, the present secretary for defence. ""His agenda is modest,"" writes Newhouse. ""He concentrates on just a few subjects, but these he routinely bulldozes into submission."" Although, on his own recent visit to Europe, Rumsfeld continued to bulldoze - NMD is ""simply inescapable"", he said - many allies are becoming less not more willing to accept his analysis. The politeness they showed to Mr Bush masks the growing likelihood that any European government with a socialist element in its coalition will be working to oppose NMD, as a source of global instability which Washington has not succeeded in talking down.  In response, the British line is that it's too early to raise such alarms. Everyone should hold off arguing until we know more about Washington's real intentions. This is typically disingenuous. 
The missile defence system to which all efforts have been, albeit imperfectly, directed is space-based, rather than speculative and unresearched boost-phase interception. That means using Menwith Hill for satellite relay and, more offensively, Fylingdales as an integral element in the chain of early warning radar. Early NMD probably means early British involvement.  The Ministry of Defence sounds ambivalent about the prospect. Officials express their anxiety about being drawn into a misuse of our own stretched defence resources. Meanwhile, though, they scheme to be a part of it, in keeping with their special alliance. The instinct of defence officials not to get left out has no limit. The top brass are therefore now working to seek a place for British scientists on the NMD development teams. As one of the top military people told me not long ago, everything must always be done to reinforce the outwards signs of London's concurrence with Washington, for a simple reason: ""If we disagree, we tend to find the door not slammed - but rather less wide open.""  That axiom now faces a challenge from two quarters. The first is Europe. The objections to NMD focus on finding a credible balance between threat and response. As Newhouse argues, the biggest, and perhaps most answerable, threats to the US come from more immediate and less expensive items than first-generation ICBMs. Europe, he suggests, may want to get together with Vladimir Putin to make a realistic assessment of threats to their shared landmass. This would only be divisive between Europe and America if the Bush administration caused it to be.  The second challenge should be just as strong. Opposing NMD is not another bout of CND-ism. It's not about crypto-pacifism, or any other of the charges levelled at Labour in the 1980s. It says, along with many Americans, that NMD is not self-evidently benign, and may be a waste of money and stability. It insists the debate must go on in public before irrevocable decisions are made, which may in any case be impossible to carry out.  For Fylingdales is a more inflammatory target than Menwith Hill. Some in the ministry privately doubt whether its physical extension, necessary for NMD, could be done, in face of direct action against the American bulldozer and the desecration of the Yorkshire Moors. Minority protest could be forged into public opinion. There seems a good chance that Labour will become the agency where that opinion finds its voice, and thereby regain some self-respect

1,"Some people here think war with Iraq is close. They range beyond the civilians at the top of the Pentagon. They want a war, and they have a case. Saddam Hussein is already in breach of numerous UN demands, and is certain, they believe, to multiply his breaches, starting on December 8, when he is required to produce a full declaration of his mass-destruction assets and will certainly not do so. At the next stage, when inspections get fully under way, there will be more breaches. The war party envisages an early hearing at the White House, at which President Bush is persuaded, over the head of Secretary of State Powell, that the US cannot afford to be jerked around for further weeks by Russians, French and Mexicans at the UN, and must not wait to attack. There's a precedent for the precipitate action that would follow. In December 1998, Bill Clinton launched bombing raids on Iraq at the very moment the UN security council was meeting to discuss what to do about Saddam. Mr Bush, the case goes, has stronger unilateralist instincts than Clinton, and is surrounded by officials who nurture them. An attack will happen soon, early 2003 at the latest, without UN support if necessary.  I think this quite unlikely. Conversations inside the Bush administration and at the UN begin to produce the shape of the more probable scenario. Among other things this will force European (and indeed American) anti-warriors to think more seriously about their position than Bush has given them the luxury of doing so far.  It's always possible Saddam will be very stupid, and orchestrate provocations nobody can ignore, but what most American officials are preparing for is a long game. For example, the December 8 declaration could declare several hundred thousand documents purporting to be the history of chemical-agent production in Iraq. They wouldn't be what the UN wants, but the inspectors would need to study them. Many possible Iraqi responses, evasive but not blatantly in breach, have been thought about and docketed. The pattern of obstruction will need to be conclusive before war starts.  This is because Bush has become, in effect, an internationalist. His own inner demons used, of course, to be different. Their message was, and implicitly still is, voiced by Vice-President Cheney, a rigid opponent of any UN involvement. But from the moment in September when Bush opted for the UN route, the need for international support became rooted deep in his strategy. His election victory, touted as a hawkish moment, gives him more strength to wait for it to build.  The main reason he wants it is to be found not in the war so much as the victory that follows. A senior UN official contrasted for me a victory gained by America alone, leaving the US to carry the entire burden of Arab hatred as it struggled alone to hold Iraq together, with a victory under the collective UN banner, in which many states share the material and moral   responsibility for what the world decided to do. ""Bush will go a long way to build that alliance,"" the official said.  His chances of doing so via the UN are better than they were. The US spent eight weeks fending off the demand, from France and Russia mainly, that there must be a second resolution before further Iraqi infractions are formally converted into a casus belli. They won that one. But Washington agreed to return for a security council discussion, in terms so clear that a Clinton-style pre-emptive strike would be seen, by faithful Britain as much as anyone, as an intolerable betrayal.  However, the chances of a second resolution being voluntarily proposed by the US or Britain are quite high, since the chances of it being passed are improving. France, having righteously defended the UN process for eight weeks, now sees its Iraqi contracts being broken and is losing interest in blocking further action. China, distant from the scene, is more interested in bilateral relations with the US than defending Saddam. An isolated Russia would be reluctant to cast a veto. With the permanent five on side, a simple security council majority would be enough for war. Ensuring it is a task on which the diplomats are now embarked.  This doesn't alter the difficulties of agreeing when Iraq should be deemed conclusively in violation. As the inspectors go in, the speculative nits are being interminably picked on the 24-hour TV news programmes here. That could go on for months, and the war party will get more contemptuously rowdy. My impression, though, is that for both military and diplomatic reasons Washington will be patient. The armaments need to be in place. Most of all, the allies need to agree. An official at the national security council startled me by volunteering that six months could pass before anything happened. I now see why he may be right.  I draw three conclusions from this trip. The first is that, in the delicate matter of deciding when enough has been enough, Prime Minister Blair will have a crucial, perhaps decisive, voice. Bush desperately needs Blair, and Blair desperately needs the UN. If Blair cannot agree that Saddam has yet insulted the world order enough to justify war, Bush's hand may be temporarily stayed.  Second, the probability of war at some stage is high, verging on certain. The inspection process may yield its own peace dividends. Saddam is already less secure than he was, as witness his referendum and the prisoner releases. Perhaps Mr Blix will destabilise him further, simply by being there, and with the power to take willing witnesses out of Iraq to a new life in exchange for testimony. But don't bet on it. The US/UN demands will be unrelenting. Short of the assassin's bullet - regarded longingly in Washington - war will be the only way to meet them.  But thirdly, this does look more like being a UN war. Saddam's chances of splitting the security council are receding. France, having insured the system against US unilateralism, is now as keen as anyone to see the back of the monster. There may not be many more forces than American, British and French in the field and the air, but time and palpably serious intent are producing deals with Iraq's neighbours - Turkey, perhaps even Iran - that begin to close the trap.  A UN war doesn't destroy the arguments against any war at all. The hazards of bio-chemical retaliation will remain. The death of innocent civilian Iraqis will be a brutal certainty. What kind of post-war Iraq, a subject of Polyanna-ish optimism in the Bush administration, is a question that should dog all regime-changers. Al-Qaida will feed. But the issue now, if I'm right, is not the simple one of American superpowerdom and whether Blair should be tailgating in its wake. It is whether, by internationalising the Iraqi conflict, Bush and Blair, with Chirac and Putin in acquiescence, will make the world a safer place. Unless one is to say the UN, from being anathema to the US, has become her tool, the case has strengthened, and needs more than ranting to defeat it."
1,"This will sound to some people like an anti-American column. It is not meant to be. As the writer, I assert that it is not. I'm the one who knows. I am not anti-American in any of the conditioning senses the epithet usually signifies: ethnically hostile, corporately obsessed, economically resentful, chanting every night the well-known litany of Washington's postwar dirty deeds. That my disclaimer is necessary, however, is a commentary on the diminished state of consultative democracy just now. The least considered aspect of the war against terrorism is that a loyalty test - are you pro- or anti-American? - has become the obligatory standard against which deductions are made about anything written on American foreign policy. For in the land of the first amendment, the normal rules of discourse are now blurred. The possibility of civilised people, all sharing the same loyalty, disagreeing about the right way forward is much attenuated. A single label can be made to wipe out every nuance. If you're not with me, you may be proving that you aren't a patriot. President Bush's state of the union address was redolent of the triumphalism and alarm that obliterate every alternative mind-set.  It was a fine oration by a war leader who is carrying all before him. The war has allowed a president without a mandate to grow into a heroic figure whom nobody wishes to challenge. Thus far it has been an impressive campaign, defying the military and political prophets who said the Taliban would take far longer to remove. Osama bin Laden remains at large, and al-Qaida networks perhaps still girdle the globe. Innocent Afghans have been killed. But, as recent wars go, this one has so far been the most efficient in all respects.  And now it will be pressed forward. The speech, I think, did not so much stoke up as reflect a national mood that there's a great deal more to do. But it was scarcely understated. What is the evidence that there really are ""tens of thousands of trained terrorists still at large""? We begin to understand that in Bush's mind the Afghan campaign, aided by the Northern Alliance, may have been the easy bit - compared with destroying the nebulous cohorts now being sought by the same US agencies that have been unable to track down the anthrax terrorist in their own backyard.  So he was preparing Americans for the long haul. They do still prefer other people to take the human risks. They wouldn't put troops on the ground to seal the Pakistan border, which may be how Bin Laden escaped. Though the special forces are there, the Northern Alliance locals do most of the dirty work. But it's a fight for a world cause, and it is being run by America: one command, one air force, a unifying intelligence, an uncomplicated national will and no Jacques Chirac poking his nose into daily targeting decisions as he did in Kosovo.  However, the state of the union address had certain blank bits. There were important absences. Only fleeting references were allowed to any other country. It was as if these other participants in the drama barely existed, which in terms of the military effort was, by Washington's choice, true enough, but which, as a diplomatic statement, seemed both ignorant and dangerous. The need for the coalition was perfunctorily acknowledged, but not the faintest doubt was allowed to attach to the fact that it would continue to operate on America's terms.  The military success, in other words, emboldened the president to speak as though there is no broader purpose than the assertion of American power. He sounded like a man whose war had intensified rather than slackened his belief in America, if necessary, going it alone. Other voices, it appears, are not terribly interesting, especially European voices that bring up the priority of a Middle East peace process being resumed, or publicly insist on codes of behaviour in the Guantanamo prison camp that rest on different attitudes to human rights than those now prevailing in war-torn America.  There can be arguments about that. Our governments do not have them, at least in public. To judge from the tortuous haste with which Mr Blair yesterday backed away from the early doubts his foreign secretary expressed about Camp X-Ray, they don't have them in private either. Instead, we fall in with the unilateralist impulse of a new age. The era of guilt (Vietnam) and the era of dithering (Clinton) have been replaced by a fresh discovered triumph of American will, that more and more permits Washington to take decisions which have to pass only an exclusive test of the American national interest. Such was the state of the union that Bush seemed to be describing on Tuesday night.  It is not entirely new. Unilateralist wrecking of the Kyoto treaty and the international criminal court began with Clinton. But Bush is pushing more recklessly ahead. The killing of the ABM treaty is a done deal. Nuclear testing is blithely listed for resumption. Nuclear warhead reductions agreed with Moscow may be scuppered by a Bush decision to store his own dismantled warheads anyway, just in case. Now, with all the yapping about Camp X-Ray, the White House has begun to ruminate in semi-public that, like ABM, the Geneva Conventions may be suddenly unsuitable to the new era.  Many Americans must find this only sensible. After all, it reflects power relationships nobody can contest. Post-Afghanistan, it seems to be the new reality. But it carries costs, which a pro-American should be the first to lament.  First, it negates the notion of a world community of self-respecting nations, many of which have much to contribute to making this a safer place. In George Bush's America, there's evidently little room for a sense of noblesse oblige. This America is an alliance-builder only for her national purposes. She's the only great power in the world, but shrinks from what it means to be a world power. Anti-terrorism became her postcommunist mission, and it's a vital one. But world power surely carries the responsibility to look wider, towards a benign shaping of decisions that are collective not unilateral.  Second, though the campaign against al-Qaida has been brilliantly destructive of appalling evil forces, it has far to go. Bush's own account of the nightmares he's trying to pre-empt makes that very clear. How can he hope to do it solely through the might of American power and intelligence? For a campaign lasting that long, there's a hearts-and-minds problem all over the Middle East and Asia. That's where the real anti-Americans live. They present a challenge to patience, subtlety and understanding, as well as military zeal. They need to see America living up to her best and broadest values. Bush paid lip service to that in his speech: ""human dignity ... rule of law ... free speech ... equal justice"". But in the face of homeland hubris, what price words?"
2,"Think of it as the sonofabitch school of foreign policy. Legend has it that when Franklin D Roosevelt was confronted with the multiple cruelties of his ally, the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, he replied: ""He may be a sonofabitch, but he's our sonofabitch.""More than 60 years on, that serves as a pretty good expression of American, and therefore British, attitudes to Islam Karimov, the tyrant of Tashkent who has ruled the central Asian republic of Uzbekistan since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991.That he is a sonofabitch is beyond dispute. Like so many despots before him, Karimov has looked to medieval times for ever more brutal methods of oppression. Hence the return of the cauldron, boiling alive two of his critics in 2002. Uzbekistan holds up to 6,000 political prisoners; independent economic activity has been crushed; religious practice is severely restricted; there is no free press; and the internet is censored. On December 26, when the world was marvelling at Ukraine's orange revolution, Karimov was hosting an election that was not nearly as close - he had banned all the opposition parties.  But, hey, what's a little human rights violation among friends? And Karimov has certainly been our friend. Shortly after 9/11, he allowed the US to locate an airbase at Khanabad - a helpful contribution to the upcoming war against Afghanistan. Since then he has been happy to act as a reliable protector of central Asian oil and gas supplies, much coveted by a US eager to reduce its reliance on the Gulf states. And he has gladly let Uzbekistan be used for what is euphemistically known as ""rendition"", the practice of exporting terror suspects to countries less squeamish about torture than Britain or the US. This was the matter over which the heroic Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Tashkent, fell out with his employers: he argued that Britain was ""selling its soul"" by using information gathered under such heinous circumstances.  Brushing Murray's qualms to one side, London and Washington remained grateful to Karimov. A procession of top Bush administration officials trekked to Tashkent to thank the dictator for his services. Donald Rumsfeld, not content with that 1983 photo of himself shaking hands with Saddam Hussein, praised Karimov for his ""wonderful cooperation"", while George Bush's former Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, admired the autocrat's ""very keen intellect and deep passion"" for improving the lives of ordinary Uzbeks.And perhaps this egregious example of sonofabitchism would have remained all but unnoticed had it not been for the past few days. For having ugly friends can only work if people don't look at your companion too closely - and this week the world saw Karimov in action. When opponents took to the streets last Friday, the dictator ordered his troops to open fire. Uzbek official figures speak of 169 dead; human rights groups estimate the toll at between 500 and 750 - most of them unarmed.  When crowds demonstrated in Lebanon, Ukraine and Georgia, the Americans welcomed it as ""people power"". But the brave stand in Uzbekistan brought a different response. Washington called for ""restraint"" from both sides, as if the unarmed civilians were just as guilty as those shooting at them. In the past couple of days, the tune has changed slightly. Now the state department wants Tashkent to ""institute real reforms"" and address its ""human rights problems"". It is at least possible that Washington may soon decide Karimov has become an embarrassment and that he should be replaced by a new, friendlier face - but one just as reliable. Less of a sonofabitch, but still ours.  Sonofabitchism has always been an awkward business, even in Roosevelt's day; it hardly squares with America's image of itself as a beacon in a dark world. But the contradiction - some would call it hypocrisy - is all the greater now. For this is the Bush era, and the Bush doctrine is all about spreading democracy and ""the untamed fire of freedom"" to the furthest corner of the globe. If that's the rhetoric, then it's hard to reconcile with a reality that involves funneling cash to a man who boils his enemies.  Maybe Bush should just break with the past and fight his war for democracy with pure, democratic means. But that would frighten him. Allow elections in countries now deemed reliable - say Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Morocco - and who knows what havoc might be unleashed? Washington fears it would lose its friends, only to see them replaced by the enemy itself: radical Islamists, the force most likely to win democratic contests in large swaths of the Arab world.That is the conundrum. And yet the case that America, and Britain for that matter, should not only talk the democratic talk but walk the democratic walk is powerful - and not only in pure, idealistic terms. This argument has realpolitik on its side, too.First, despots make bad allies - who all too often become adversaries. Let us recall two men who once played the role of America's sonofabitch. In the 80s, the US backed Saddam against Iran and Osama bin Laden against the Soviets. The US gave those men the guns that would eventually be turned on itself.Second, pragmatic pacts with the devil don't work. For one thing, by   repressing their peoples, tyrannies foment, not prevent, terrorism. But such deals in the name of democracy also taint the very cause they are meant to serve. Thus liberal reformers across the Middle East now struggle to make their case to Arab publics who have grown suspicious that ""democracy"" means US occupation, a sell-off of oil and Abu Ghraib.Third, if democracy really is the panacea the Bush doctrine insists it is, then shouldn't it be trusted to work its magic? Put another way, surely a government that truly represented its people would bring the freedom and stability Washington yearns for - regardless of its political complexion?Perhaps most reassuring to policymakers would be this fact. Even Middle Eastern democrats themselves are not calling for an overnight revolution; they know that in their stifled societies the only public sphere that exists, besides   the state, is the mosque. It is for that reason that if elections were held tomorrow in, say, Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood would take power.But if the west made the vast financial and military aid it already gives to these regimes conditional on perhaps a three-year programme of gradual liberalisation - lifting emergency laws, allowing proper funding of political parties - then soon some space would open up, terrain occupied neither by the despots nor the mullahs. Different parties and forces could start organising for a future ballot in which they had a decent shot at success.That surely would be more logically consistent than the current, contradictory reliance on tyrants to advance the cause of freedom. And it might have a chance of working in practice - even in a place as benighted as Uzbekistan."
2,"They are a minority now in Israeli politics, at least according to the polls. But spare a thought this election day for the Israeli peacenik: how should he or she vote today? If it were a direct presidential clash between Likud's Bibi Netanyahu and Kadima's Tzipi Livni  the only two candidates with a realistic chance of becoming prime minister  then the choice might be straightforward. They would back Livni. After all, she believes in the two-state solution, with a Palestinian state alongside Israel, and has been negotiating with the Palestinians as foreign minister for the last 18 months, if not longer. Bibi meanwhile still rejects the very idea of a Palestinian state  which even George W Bush accepted  and rules out territorial compromise. But a simple choice of Tzipi over Bibi is not on the Israeli ballot today. Israel's is a parliamentary system with an extreme form of proportional representation, offering this year a record 33 parties to choose from. So which one should the dovish voter pick?  Some are plumping for Kadima, on the simple logic that Livni needs as many seats as possible to squeak ahead of Netanyahu and have a chance at forming a government. That's the position Ha'aretz  the paper of choice for liberal Israel  effectively adopted in its editorial on Tuesday morning, endorsing Livni as the best choice for PM.   But others are holding back, deterred by Livni's role as part of the ruling troika responsible for the military offensive in Gaza. What's more, Kadima has signalled its willingness to form a coalition with Avigdor Lieberman, the strongman whose race-baiting campaign has centred on his promise to strip Israel's Arab citizens of their citizenship  including their right to vote  if they refuse to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state.  The obvious solution should be to vote Labour, once Israel's natural party of government and the home of the peace camp. The trouble there is that party leader Ehud Barak was, as defence minister, the co-author of Operation Cast Lead. What's more, Bibi has telegraphed pretty clearly that he plans to appoint Barak as his defence minister in a Likud-Labour coalition, so the Labour voter would end up with Bibi as PM. What's worse, Barak has not ruled out joining a government that includes Lieberman.  What's left? Meretz is the pure left choice, favoured by many in the media and academic elites clustered around north Tel Aviv. But it had a muddled stance on Cast Lead, supporting it first, then opposing it. It has a well-liked but unforceful leader and, since a centre-left coalition is unlikely, it will almost certainly be destined for opposition. And what if Livni loses to Bibi by a whisker? Plenty of Meretz types will feel guilty that they didn't hold their noses and give Kadima that extra push.  Some are going a stage further, backing the Jewish-Arab, onetime communist party, Hadash. It's become trendier this year among young leftists, and it had a clear line against the Gaza offensive from the start. But it, too, is destined for opposition and its advocacy of a single state  rather than a two-state solution  puts it beyond the pale for many on the traditional Zionist left.  So it's not an easy choice. Plenty of people here have asked how I would vote if I had the chance. The truth is I don't know; I'd be wavering between pragmatism and principle, between blocking Likud and Lieberman and a vote of conscience. I don't envy the doves of Israel their dilemma. Postscript added at the author's request on February 11 at 18:00: ""I fear I may have mischaracterised Hadash's position. While many supporters of that party speak of Jews and Arabs eventually sharing a single state, Hadash's official stance calls for two states side by side, on the 1967 lines."
2,"It must have been the effect of reading Martin Amis on the prime minister's last days in office so soon after watching England draw against Brazil, but I have finally realised who Tony Blair reminds me of, who indeed serves as his spiritual doppelg&auml;nger. Why, of course, it's David Beckham.It's not just that both men are engaged in drawn-out epilogues after long spells leading their nations. (In 2006, Beckham resigned the England captaincy and Blair announced he would be gone within a year - both prompting a rash of tributes. Yet look: they are both still here!)Nor is it that they are both en route to pastures new and more lucrative: the US. We know Beckham has signed a four-year, &pound;128m contract to play for Los Angeles Galaxy. But Blair is no less of a cert on the US calendar for 2007/8, where he is surely destined to rack up mega-bucks on the lecture circuit.The money will come in handy, because both men are partnered by women with a taste for the finer things in life - combined with a nose for a good deal. Note the fondness for free stuff exhibited by both Mrs Beckham, when she was caught by a 2002 TV documentary gladly receiving merchandise gratis from Topshop, and by Mrs Blair in 2003, when the manager of a Melbourne clothes outlet suggested Cherie pick out ""a few things"" as gifts - only to see the PM's wife leave with 68 items, worth more than &pound;2,000.Nor is it even that both men have overcome the impediment of speaking voices that do not automatically fit the macho expectations of alpha-male leadership. (Listen to early Beckham and Blair: their voices are slight, even vaguely effete.)All of these parallels are striking, but there is one that matters more. It was touched on by Blair in that interview with Amis. What will you be in the future, the novelist asked: an ex-politician? Oh no, came the answer. ""I'll be a former celebrity.""This, of course, is what sets both men apart from their peers. Blair was never just a politician, just as Beckham was never just a footballer. They both transcended their fields, becoming internationally iconic figures. When the historians of the future want to understand the Britain of the early 21st century they could do worse than start with these two. Like paired lions on a coat of arms, they are the very symbol of contemporary Britishness."
2,"So now we know: this is what soon-to-be-ex-presidents do. Bill Clinton spent his final hours in the White House trying to patch together a deal between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat and now George Bush promises to spend his last year the same way, confronting the problem that has defeated successive presidents for nearly 30 years. Will he share their fate or could the road from Annapolis somehow, despite everything, lead to peace in Jerusalem?The reasons to be cheerless are too numerous to count. Start at the top, with the Americans who will preside over the process, which was given a formal launch at the White House yesterday. You don't have to succumb to the snobbish observation that, on Tuesday's evidence, Bush still can't quite pronounce the names of the leaders he is meant to bring together to have serious misgivings. The president promised his ""personal commitment"" to the Herculean task, yet he dashed away from Annapolis three hours after he arrived, leaving Condoleezza Rice in charge. Not a huge crime, but a sign that Bush has no intention of immersing himself in the detail as Clinton did - an effort which was surely pivotal in bringing the two sides as close as they were by the end of 2000.It emphasised what Bush had already announced, that the US will play only a hands-off role in the core, substantive negotiations. Officially, Israeli and Palestinians say that's fine, that in the end no one can end their conflict for them. But talks as complex as this need an involved mediator, one who can sometimes play referee, sometimes bridging seemingly impossible gaps - and Bush has formally eschewed that role. Incredibly, the steering committee for these core talks will be headed by the enemies themselves, with no outside broker.It's true that the US will be directly involved in overseeing the implementation of the two sides' promises under the ill-fated 2003 roadmap - the Palestinian commitment to crack down on terror, the Israeli pledge to freeze settlement expansion - but this hardly inspires confidence. Bush has made such promises before: the soon-to-be appointed US monitor, former Nato commander Jim Jones, should remind himself of the fates of the Mitchell, Zinni and Tenet missions of the recent past. Troubling too is the US designation of itself as sole judge and jury of the parties' performance. It seems as if Washington has quietly killed off the Quartet, in which it took such decisions jointly with the UN, EU and Russia.Other weaknesses were even more obvious. Missing from the Annapolis feast was Hamas, which governs one half of the territory of the future Palestinian state. They and their followers made their views known with mass demonstrations in Gaza and the West Bank on Tuesday, declaring: ""The only dialogue with the enemy will be with rifles and rockets."" If the men of violence were to revert to type, seeking to derail progress by launching an attack on Israeli civilians, then Ehud Olmert would respond fiercely. Several analysts I spoke to in Annapolis said Israel was ""on the cusp"" of retaking Gaza by force. Perhaps Olmert would be happy to keep on talking peace to Mahmoud Abbas and Fatah under those circumstances, but could Abbas do it and remain credible in the eyes of his own people? More sharply, could Abbas really topple Hamas and ride back into power in Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank? Even Israel's sunniest officials concede that Gaza is ""the achilles heel"" of the process.Even if Abbas and Olmert were to be allowed to get on with it, there's good reason to doubt they could reconcile their differences. Negotiators for the two men worked till 4am on Tuesday and were still haggling minutes before Bush took to the podium with a text that, in the end, dodged every point of contention. ""The document could not even set out the problems, let alone state solutions,"" sighed the longtime Palestinian negotiator Ahmad Khalidi. It spoke of ""core issues"", which everyone knows means borders, Jerusalem and refugees - but they could not find the words to say so. They could agree on a process, but are a long, long way from peace.The negatives don't end there. Sixteen Arab states were present in Maryland, but hardly show signs of the deep economic and political engagement which I understand British officials believe could make a critical difference. Meanwhile, some of those at Annapolis fear the sheer hoopla - with one quarter of the world's foreign ministers present - means that there's simply a greater distance to fall when the process fails, leading to disillusion with the very notion that diplomacy can bring results.So there is no shortage of good arguments for pessimism. And yet, if only because such bleakness is bad for the soul, there are reasons not to give up just yet. Those of us who have lamented the absence of a peace process for seven long and bloody years can hardly grumble now that one is beginning. Talking is always better than not talking and certainly better than killing.The new process also has some assets worth exploiting. Sure, Olmert and Abbas are weak, but they seem to share something else too - a rapport which was entirely missing between Arafat and Barak. They are not starting from scratch, but have been talking frequently for months. Nor do they have to reinvent the wheel - the outlines of a peace settlement are already well-known, chiefly in the so-called Clinton parameters and refined in a variety of other unofficial efforts. Ariel Sharon already did much of the heavy lifting in preparing Israelis for compromise, explaining that they will eventually have to give up land. That readiness has remained in ""suspended animation"" ever since, says David Landau, the editor of the Israeli daily Ha'aretz. But it can be activated when the moment is ripe.The peacemakers have fear on their side too. It was fear of Iran that brought most of the Arab states to Annapolis. They reckon that progress for the Palestinians will blunt Iran's appeal in the battle of Muslim hearts and minds, pushing back Iran's regional ascendancy. That degree of international support gives Abbas essential cover. With the Arab League behind him, he won't be making historic compromises alone.Today is the 60th anniversary of the UN vote which sought to partition historic Palestine into two states, one for the Jews, one for the Palestinians. It is a resolution that remains only half-implemented. Now there is a slender chance of completing the job - and surely, despite the thousand obstacles, the world has to grab it with both hands."
2,"In a neat bit of symmetry, why not end the year as we began it? On January 1 this column made six reckless predictions for 2003. The first was that the US and Britain would take military action in Iraq. Next came forecasts that Ariel Sharon would be re-elected in Israel, going on to rule with a narrow, rightwing coalition rather than a government of national unity; that Gordon Brown would say the five economic tests on the euro had not been passed; that the new constitution for Europe would end up as a dish of classic Brussels fudge; that the Tories would dump IDS; and that Northern Irish elections would see Sinn Fin and anti-agreement Unionists emerge as the two biggest forces in the province. OK, maybe it didn't exactly take Mystic Meg to predict war in Iraq or, indeed, any of the above. And the European guess turned out to be far too optimistic; instead of a fudge, the union did not agree a constitution at all. But there is the beginning of a tradition to maintain here, so why not give it another whirl?  <B> 1 The Hutton Report. </B> His lordship is due to publish his findings on January 12. Officially, all he is required to do is offer a full account of the ""circumstances surrounding the death of Dr David Kelly"", but the conventional wisdom has already endowed the Hutton report with much more significance than that. It is, they say, the document that could destroy Tony Blair and transform the BBC.  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Hutton steers clear of the ground that could be most perilous for Blair - the honesty or otherwise of the September 2002 dossier on Iraq's military capacity. There is no killer sentence accusing him of leading the country falsely to war. (As an unelected judge, Hutton would tremble at the thought of toppling an elected head of government.) Instead, Hutton spreads the pain evenly. The BBC is faulted both for the sloppy editorial procedures that allowed Andrew Gilligan to overshoot on his original story and for the dual role of the board of governors, acting as both regulator of the BBC and protector of its independence. Hutton suggests the latter be reformed. As for the government, he criticises the ""naming strategy"" that exposed Kelly, perhaps even laying some personal blame for that on the prime minister. Blair bites his lower lip and takes full responsibility - but survives. Likeliest heads to roll are at the Ministry of Defence: Geoff Hoon is vulnerable, but so are his mandarins.  <B> 2 The US election.</B> This month sees the first tests of Democratic opinion, in Iowa and New Hampshire. The winner there will then hurtle into a sharply accelerated contest whose outcome should be clear by March. With no primary challenge on the Republican side, the Democratic winner will go head-to-head with George Bush in November in a contest that will profoundly affect the world for the rest of the decade.  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Former Vermont governor Howard Dean dominates the early contests. On February 3, in South Carolina, the field winnows, with a single Stop Dean candidate emerging from the pack; there is a southern surge for former general Wesley Clark. But it is not enough: Dean is the nominee. Meanwhile, Bush enjoys the huge advantage handed him by the absence of a primary battle. Unopposed, he strives towards November, distracted only by a flurry of speculation as to whether he will dump the cardiacally challenged Dick Cheney from the ticket. With the economy improving, Saddam Hussein in captivity and Dean easily lampooned as a 21st-century McGovernite liberal, Bush walks it.  <B> 3 Iraq.</B> The American dilemmas persist. Should we stay or should we go? Should we carry this burden alone or allow others, including those in the coalition of the unwilling who refused to back the war, a piece of the reconstruction action too? And what should we do with Saddam?  <B> Reckless prediction:</B> Day to day anti-occupation violence continues, taking the shine   off the Saddam capture - it proves he was not directing the resistance from his spider hole after all. The Americans, mindful of their electoral timetable, start looking for exits. Bush family retainer and presidential special envoy James Baker negotiates a deal with France and the other refuseniks: they give international legitimacy to Iraqi elections in return for lucrative reconstruction contracts. The elections - run as local caucuses rather than under the traditional, but less controllable, one-person, one-vote system - take place in August and are hailed as proof that America's mission of liberation is accomplished. The troops start coming home: these pictures, unlike those of returning coffins, are televised. To be on the safe side, ""legal process"" ensures Saddam gets nowhere near a dock - where he might shoot his mouth off about past US support for his regime - at least not before November.  <B> 4 Israel and Palestine. </B> According to the US-backed road map for Middle East peace, a viable, independent Palestinian state should be just 12 months away. Yet there was next to no progress in 2003 - just fine speeches and a signing ceremony in June, followed by the departure of moderate Palestinian PM Abu Mazen in September. Will 2004 be any better?  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Washington, in an election year, refuses to pressure Israel. Violence continues. But the cracks in the domestic Israeli ice that appeared in 2003 get wider in 2004. The host of rival peace plans dominate public discourse; a consensus emerges, from the military elites down, that Sharon's way is futile. In a shock development, the corruption allegations that have long swirled over the PM engulf him and he is forced to resign. He is replaced by Binyamin Netanyahu.  <B> 5 The home front. </B> In what is likely to be the last full year before a general election and the start of Labour's eighth in office, how will the domestic landscape look?  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Michael Howard continues to get good ink from the rightwing press, especially when bolstered by a solid result in June's elections for the European parliament. Back in the Labour fold, Ken Livingstone cruises to a second term as mayor of London and hints that his election-winning formula is the clear alternative to Blairism. Gordon Brown stays on as chancellor - and waits.  <B> 6 And finally.</B> Finding Nemo is nominated as best picture at the Oscars and England do well in the European Championships. How well? Now here is where the crystal ball begins to get a little cloudy...  Happy New Year."
2,"Schools do it, hospitals do it, even FTSE-listed companies do it. So let's do it, let's see how we've done. After all, this is the age of the performance assessment review and this column is surely not immune. We're happy enough to dish it out on these pages, so we can hardly object if the harsh light of scrutiny is turned on ourselves, just this once. As it happens, I have an easy mechanism in place for some searching self-assessment. A year ago I set out a clutch of ""reckless predictions"" for 2004. Flush with the success of a similar effort 12 months earlier - in which each one of my guesses came true - I thought I would have another go. To look back at the list now is to have a handy, at-a-glance guide to where I hit the bullseye - and where the dart plunged deep into my own foot.  I began with the Hutton report, which was then just a few weeks away. Rightly, I predicted that there would be no ""killer sentence"" accusing Tony Blair of leading the country falsely to war, and that the prime minister would survive. I also guessed that his lordship would fault the BBC for its sloppy editorial processes and the dual role of its board of governors.  After that, my vision got distinctly cloudy. I reckoned that Hutton would ""spread the pain evenly"", criticising the government for the naming strategy that outed David Kelly, perhaps even laying some direct blame for that at Blair's feet. I suggested that some Ministry of Defence officials were vulnerable, too. As we now know, that was all wrong. Hutton inflicted pain only on one side. I thought the judge would ""steer clear"" of the most perilous terrain - the honesty or otherwise of the September 2002 dossier - but he was not nearly so timorous. He ruled unambiguously that the dossier had not been sexed-up.  Next was the US election. I guessed the final result right - predicting that Bush would win comfortably - but got the other half of the race badly wrong. I tipped the former Vermont governor Howard Dean to be the Democratic nominee, failing even to mention John Kerry.  On Iraq, I was again only half-right. I expected the violence to continue, dismissing the wave of euphoria at that time over Saddam's capture and the faulty assumption that he had been masterminding the insurgency from his spiderhole. That was OK. But I also guessed that the US would spend 2004 looking for the exits, timetabling elections for August so that at least some US troops could start coming home - in time to be photographed hugging their wives before Americans went to their polls on November 2. Not so. Iraqi elections are scheduled for next month and the US is as dug in as ever.  Israel-Palestine offered similarly uneven proof of my soothsaying abilities. I didn't have to be Doris Stokes to guess that Washington would continue to refuse to pressure Israel. But I also said that a slew of rival peace plans would dominate Israeli domestic politics and that the old Sharon way would be seen as futile. That turned out to be right, though in a way I did not predict. For it was Sharon himself who felt compelled to generate a new strategy, in the form of his Gaza pullout plan. Where I was 180-degrees wrong was my hot tip that corruption allegations would finally engulf Sharon, prompting his resignation. It's nearly 2005 and he's still there.  On the home front, I thought Michael Howard would have a goodish year and score solidly in June's European elections. It's true that the Tories did top the poll - but with a dismal 27% of the vote, their lowest share in any nationwide election since 1832. On Labour, the crystal ball was slightly clearer. I wrote that Ken Livingstone would be readmitted to the party and cruise to re-election as London mayor: he was and he did. And on the government's longest-running soap, I offered just one line: ""Gordon Brown stays on as chancellor - and waits.""   All told, it's a patchy, middling record. So, in the manner of these exercises, it's probably wise to look for some lessons learned. On the US, the Dean debacle has taught me to relearn a rule I used to swear by when I worked in Washington: that the US conventional wisdom is always, always wrong. I can give a hundred examples, but the most recent is surely the consensus that existed among Washington know-alls on the afternoon of November 2, declaring that America was about to salute President Kerry. The US punditocracy has a knack for getting it wrong, and I should have distrusted that herd instinct on Dean - and on everything else.  But there is a larger point that connects the blunders and, coming from a journalist, it's a surprising one. Put simply, I suspect I was insufficiently cynical. I really did think that Lord Hutton, as a senior judge, would feel obliged to weigh all the evidence fairly, rather than give the constant benefit of the doubt to the state he had always served. I similarly believed that the Israeli political system, for all its flaws, would recoil from the evidence against its prime minister. But that's not how it was.  This turned out to be a theme of the year, one I certainly did not predict: unaccountability. Thus Tony Blair could survive a second inquiry, even though its inescapable conclusion was that he had led the nation into war on a false premise. In America, the truth about Abu Ghraib could be revealed - and not a single senior head roll.  So 2004 has taught me a couple of lessons. First, don't expect the mechanisms of accountability to work. Second, predictions are a mug's game. As we have seen this week, the world is just too turbulent. Put it this way: if someone had told you that 2004 would see a cabinet minister caught in a love triangle with an American socialite, who would have been the last name on your list? Mine would have been David Blunkett."
2,"Here's a truism of Middle East diplomacy. Everyone knows the outline of the eventual settlement: there will be two states, one Israeli, one Palestinian, alongside each other, their borders roughly in line with the parameters set out by Bill Clinton in late 2000. Everyone knows that. Yet somehow the two sides cannot seem to reach this apparently obvious destination. Even back in 2000, when the Israeli cabinet was packed with doves and the peace process was led by a US president engaged in every last detail, the deal remained elusive. Since then, it has fallen ever further out of reach.  The conventional explanation blames the leaders, weak on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides and fatally disengaged in Washington. The result is that the peoples themselves, even if they yearn for peace, have grown cynical about the two-state solution that would make that peace possible.  ""More than three-quarters believe it's not feasible,"" veteran Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki told me from his office in Ramallah yesterday. Palestinians doubt Israel's intentions: instead of giving up land, Israel continues to settle on it. Witness Monday's announcement of another 750 housing units in the Giv'at Ze'ev neighbourhood, on the wrong side of the Green Line that marks the 1967 border. What's more, the two-state solution now carries some unattractive baggage: its lead advocates are the Bush administration, seeking a legacy; the Israeli government, seeking relief from the demographic prospect of ruling over a population in which Jews and Arabs have numerical parity; and an unpopular Palestinian elite represented by President Mahmoud Abbas. If those are the cheerleaders, it's hardly surprising that few Palestinians are waving the banner for two states.  Among Israelis, the idea fares little better. They say they have withdrawn from occupied territory twice recently - from southern Lebanon and Gaza - and their reward has been a hail of rocketfire. Besides, while the Palestinians are divided between Hamas and Fatah, there is no viable Palestinian partner who could rule a neighbouring, peaceful state. If that's the situation, what could change it? The current strategy, trumpeted at Annapolis, is to get Israel and Abbas to come to an agreement. Never mind that Abbas's writ does not run in Gaza, and so such an accord would only be hypothetical - ""a shelf agreement"" - it would, say its advocates, have great impact. It would restore faith in diplomacy, and Hamas would soon have to fall in line.  That's how Tony Blair, part-time international envoy, sees it. He argues that Hamas should be kept out of any peace process until a deal is done. Once it has, and especially if the accord is popular, Hamas will come under pressure from its own people to sign up. Advocates add that the Israeli public would also lose its cynicism once the elected leaders of Israel and the Palestinians had shaken hands on an agreement.  It sounds straightforward enough, but there's precious little sign of it. The Israeli prime minister is hardly stretching every sinew to get such a deal. Instead, as the Giv'at Ze'ev decision shows, he's bowing to pressure from hardline elements in his own coalition. Nor, says one Israeli government insider, are rocket attacks and terrorist murders in Jerusalem the ideal ""atmospherics"" for negotiations. And yet there is all too little countervailing pressure in the pro-peace direction from the one player that could make a difference: Washington. Haaretz editor David Landau despairs at the lack of urgency in the talks, contrasting it with the ""frenetic"" pace back when Clinton was in charge. ""There's nothing like that now,"" he says, despite all the fine words at Annapolis.  Even if there were an agreement, it might not help. If an accord ended up gathering dust, it would discredit the two-state idea even further, confirming its status as inherently impractical. And both sides fear such a text would end up being the starting point for a future round of talks, from which they would have to compromise yet further.  There is another way: not to wait, but to bring in Hamas now. Already, an unofficial channel between Israel and Hamas via Egypt, though denied, has brought a lull in fighting. The talk is of a tahdi'a, a temporary ceasefire. Israeli sources tell me they could accept that, so long as Hamas doesn't use the pause simply to regroup and re-arm. If there is an end to Hamas weapons smuggling, as well as rocket attacks and terror operations, Israel will agree to hold its fire.  Plenty want to go further, including Hamas in the diplomatic search for an agreement. Each week seems to bring another eminent, if retired, figure from the Israeli security establishment suggesting talks with Hamas. In a Haaretz poll last month, 64% of Israelis said they would approve.  The prize would be great indeed: an agreement with the entire Palestinian nation, rather than just part of it. The risk would be high, too: Olmert could lose his coalition and could see Palestinian moderates eclipsed (just as talking with Irish republicans eventually eclipsed more moderate nationalists). Finally, there might be a way to rescue the two-state solution that does not involve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so much as swerve around it. It's been tried at least three times before and come tantalisingly close. The plan: to make peace with Syria first.  The rewards for Israel would be obvious. Instantly, it would have what its founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, dreamed of: peace accords with all its immediate neighbours, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and therefore Lebanon. Moreover, the potential spoilers to any two-state solution - Hamas, Hizbullah and Syria itself - would no longer be a threat. ""Syria is a lung through which Hizbullah breathes"", says Palestinian negotiator and analyst Hussein Agha: if Syria reconciled with Israel, the organisation would have to end its confrontation with Israel. Hamas would be in the same position. Even Iran would have to alter its behaviour. The problem of the two-state notion was never its content, says Agha, only its context - and this would be the right context.  Suddenly Israel would feel much safer in coming to an accord with the Palestinians, even a united Palestinian entity that included Hamas. The two-state solution would look less like an impossible dream and more like an item of unfinished business.  Is it possible? Syria, conscious of the expectations of Arab solidarity, would be unlikely to make a separate deal with Israel at the apparent expense of the Palestinians: there would have to be some careful sequencing to show progress on both tracks. But the good news is that a rapprochement with Syria is discussed at the highest levels in Israel, even forming part of an intelligence briefing for the prime minister this very week. The bad news is that Israel insists it has not yet had sufficient evidence that Damascus is ready to do what it takes to make peace. It also has to be seriously doubted that Olmert is strong enough to play his part - and give up the Golan Heights conquered in 1967.  There is one last obstacle in the way of a Syrian-Israel peace. Those in the know say flatly that the Bush administration will not allow Jerusalem to talk to Damascus, which it deems an associate member of the ""axis of evil"". Put it down as one more reason why the world waits, ever more impatiently, for January 20 2009 - the day George W Bush will at last be gone."
2,"In the wee small hours on Israeli television, they show reruns of what was once a staple form of mass entertainment: kibbutz choirs - the men in pressed work shirts, the women in peasant skirts - singing Hebrew folk melodies exalting the Land of Israel, while a smiling audience joins in. The pictures were black and white, the sets cardboard, and the programmes interminable - a socialist-realist tableau of a simple farming nation engaged in wholesome, patriotic amusement.  Visiting Israel last month, I sat transfixed when I stumbled across the public service channel that replays those old shows. Tonight the national celebrations will be more up to date, as Israel marks its 60th anniversary with street parties this evening and beach barbecues tomorrow. Yet if the world is watching, trying to understand the place Israel was and what it has become, it could do worse than start with those cheesy TV specials.  For one thing, too many critics like to depict the establishment of Israel in May 1948 as little more than an act of western imperialism, inserting an alien, European enclave into the mainly Arab and Muslim Middle East. In this view, the Jewish Israelis of today, with their swimming pools and waterside restaurants, are no different from their counterparts in other settler societies - the whites of Australia or, more painfully, South Africa. A look at the faces of Jewish Israel is one easy rebuttal: the new nation that has formed by mixing Moroccan and Russian, Ethiopian and Kurd, is one of the most ethnically diverse in the world. But there is a more substantial counter-argument, one that can be picked up even on those old TV singalongs.  A favourite in the patriotic repertoire is Ein Li Eretz Acheret (I Have No Other Land). In a way, no other sentence conveys the tragedy of Israel and Palestine more concisely - because of course, and with good reason, the Palestinians feel exactly the same way. They too have nowhere else. Yet this Zionist anthem articulates something very deep in Israelis' sense of themselves: they are a nation formed by those who had no other place to live. The Holocaust, inevitably, looms large in this: the establishment of a Jewish state just three years after the liberation of Auschwitz was no coincidence. After 2,000 years, the world was finally persuaded that the Jews deserved what every other people regarded as a basic right: a place of their own.  A poignant reminder that Jews really had no other place - because the rest of the world did not want them - came with the death last month of Yossi Harel, captain of the Exodus, the leaking, rusting ship that carried 4,500 Holocaust survivors from Europe to Palestine in 1947, only to be sent back - by the British - first to France and then, incredibly, to Germany. This, surely, gives the Israeli experience a different texture to the founding of, say, New Zealand, Argentina or the US. Those enterprises were fuelled chiefly by ambition and appetite for material resources. Even if those who landed on Plymouth Rock were fleeing religious intolerance, the circumstances of America's pioneers were not those of the Jews in the 1940s. The moral difference between the Jews and the white settlers of America, Africa and Australasia is the difference between a homeless man who needs a roof over his head and the landowner who fancies a second home. Those who lazily brand Zionism as imperialism should be able to tell the difference - and to remember that those who boarded those battered ships felt less like imperialists than refugees desperate for shelter. The old TV shows provide another, related corrective. They are a reminder that in some ways early Israel was less Rhodesia than it was East Germany, a small country with socialism as the state religion. Back in the 1970s, all Israeli floors looked the same: the tiles were mass produced and there was only one style. Every toilet seat was made by a single kibbutz. Foreign investors were told they were welcome - so long as they were happy to sell a 51% stake in their company to the Histadrut, Israel's TUC.  That collectivism is all but gone. Most of the kibbutzim have privatised: individual members now own their own houses and earn different wages from each other. The kibbutz was never Israel, but it stands as a metaphor for what is happening in the wider society.  Israel itself is privatising, as its people withdraw from the collective sphere and retreat into their own, individual lives. Many speak of the bu'ah they construct for themselves, the bubble in which they can hide away from the fears and angst of Israel's ""situation"". Polling reveals the dichotomy: while nearly 40% believe the country faces a ""serious threat of destruction"" from its neighbours, around 83% are ""satisfied or very satisfied"" with their own lives.  All of which has a bearing on the other meaning of tomorrow's anniversary. The US administration has set the date as a deadline for Israelis and Palestinians to show some progress in the talks launched at Annapolis last November, ahead of President Bush's visit to the region next week.  Israel insists that it is straining every sinew seeking peace, just as it has insisted throughout the past 60 years. I heard the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, explain with pride in London last week that she has kept talking to her Palestinian counterpart, even ""on days of terror"". Some of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's hawkish critics reckon the peace effort is, if anything, accelerating, in order to distract attention from the new, apparently serious, corruption inquiry just launched against him. And yet, there are few signs of a genuinely urgent Israeli desire for an accord with the Palestinians. The appearance of efforts for peace, in order to placate the legacy-hungry Bush, most certainly, but a fierce yearning for peace is harder to detect.  So when Jimmy Carter was in Jerusalem last month, carrying messages from Damascus and Hamas, no frontline Israeli minister would so much as meet him. Israel says it can't afford to legitimise Hamas, even indirectly, for fear of undermining the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Fine. In which case, surely, Israel would be doing all it could to bolster Abbas's credibility - by, say, removing West Bank outposts deemed illegal under Israeli law, or offering compensation to those Jewish settlers ready to leave occupied territory voluntarily and return to Israel-proper. Yet Olmert has done no such thing.  In this, the PM is doing no more than follow the national mood. Israelis have grown cynical about peacemaking. ""We pulled out of Lebanon in 2000 and Gaza in 2005, and what did we get for our trouble? Katyushas from Hizbullah and Qassams from Hamas. No thanks."" Besides, and few Israelis like to say this out loud, they believe they can get by without peace. Thanks, they whisper, to the separation barrier or wall, terror attacks have dwindled: Palestinian violence is contained. As for the so-called demographic factor - the notion that soon Jews and Arabs in the entire land ruled by Israel will reach numeric parity - that feels abstract and far away.   Israelis will party tonight, celebrating an economy that enjoyed 5.1% growth last year and which provides for many a good life. Only a few insomniacs will watch the old shows and remember the long-ago melodies, including the one that sounds more passe now than ever. It's called Shir L'shalom - and it is the song for peace."
2,"All those involved, and most of those following the bloodshed in Gaza from afar, are sure who is in the right and who is in the wrong. They know who the innocent victims are and who are the wicked perpetrators. These certainties are held equally firmly by those who will be demonstrating in solidarity with the Palestinians in London today and those who plan to stage similar shows of support for Israel later this month.  Both sides see the conflict in moral terms. For supporters of the Palestinians, it could not be clearer. Israel is committing a war crime, killing people in their hundreds, hammering a besieged population from the sky (and soon perhaps on the ground too), claiming to aim only at Hamas but inevitably striking those civilians who get in the way.  Israel's cheerleaders are just as clear. Israel is the victim, hitting out now only belatedly and in self-defence. Its southern citizens have sat terrorised in bomb shelters, fearing the random rockets of Hamas, since 2005, longer than any society could tolerate without fighting back.  Both sides say they would have maintained the six-month ceasefire that had held - albeit imperfectly - until December 19 had the other side not broken it first. And who did break the deal first, Hamas with its rockets or Israel with its blockade? Both sides point at the other with equal vehemence, a Newtonian chain of claimed action and reaction that can stretch back to infinity.  So perhaps a more useful exercise - especially for those who long for an eventual peace with both sides living side by side - is not to ask whether the current action is legitimate, but whether it is wise.  Israel, say its spokesmen, seeks not to trigger an Iraq-style ""regime change"" in Gaza but simply to alter Hamas' calculus, so it concludes that hurling rockets is against its own interests. Israel hopes thereby to reassert its long-cherished deterrence, so damaged in Lebanon in 2006. Hamas will be taught a lesson, abide by an enduring ceasefire and leave Israel's southern border quiet. Israel can then get on with pursuing a pact with the Fatah-led Palestinians of the West Bank.  That sounds coherent, but does it make sense? After this first phase of the conflict, Israeli officials say yes. They boast that Hamas' command and control systems have been shattered, and that its leaders are in hiding 4m under ground.  But there are immediate questions, eerily similar to the ones that surfaced in Lebanon two years ago. How exactly does this end? If Israeli tanks go into Gaza, won't they get bogged down in the mud and narrow streets of the refugee camps, terrain known intimately by Hamas? And these are only the most obvious, current concerns. The grounds for questioning the wisdom of Operation Cast Lead, even from Israel's own point of view, go much deeper.  First, even if Israel gets the quiet it wants there is every reason to believe it could have got that without resorting to war. The longtime Palestinian analyst and negotiator Hussein Agha says it would have been ""straightforward: if they had lifted the blockade, the rockets would have stopped"". Some diplomatic sources dispute this, arguing that Hamas actually saw an advantage in the sanctions regime: ""opening up would have loosened Hamas' grip,"" says one. Hence the cases of Hamas firing on border crossings as they were opened. But most Palestinians insist that a relaxation of the blockade would have granted Hamas its key objective - a chance to prove it can govern effectively - and it would not have jeopardised that with rocket fire. It would have had too much to lose.  Put that to Israelis, and they admit that prospect was unpalatable too: they can't allow Hamas, a movement whose charter drips with antisemitism and calls for Israel's eradication, to gain the appearance of legitimacy. But if, as Israel insists, its chief objective is quiet in the south, then there was at least another, non-military path it could have taken - one that those who know Hamas best insist would have stopped the Qassams. Besides, any ceasefire will involve easing the blockade, so Israel will end up making those concessions anyway. Second, if Israel hoped to break Hamas' hold on Gaza it has gone precisely the wrong way about it. Its leaders have done this many times before, repeatedly misreading the way Arab societies work. They believe that if they hit Gaza (or Lebanon) hard enough, the local population will blame Hamas (or Hezbollah) for bringing tragedy upon them. But it doesn't work like that. Instead, Gazans blame Israel - and close ranks with Hamas. ""Anything which doesn't kill Hamas makes them stronger,"" says Agha, noting the way the organisation has been lionised in recent days across the Arab world, hailed as a defiant party of resistance, turning it into a ""regional phenomenon"". Third, Israel's best hopes lie with the so-called moderate Arab leaders. But they have been badly undermined by this exercise, and none more so than the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, whose peace talks with Israel now look like consorting with a brutal enemy.  And this is without mentioning the fresh supply of hatred Israel has stored up against itself, creating a new generation of Gazans bent on revenge. Every child who witnessed this week's bombing is another recruit for the violence of the future. So, yes, there may be short-term advantage for Israel's politicians, eyeing the election calendar, in hitting Hamas hard. But the senior European official who told me that this is ""tactics, not strategy by the Israelis, who are expert in dealing with symptoms, not causes"" is surely right. This is the act of a nation that has plenty of tactics for war - but no strategy for peace. If it did, it would realise that Israel cannot pick the Palestinians' leaders for them, that Hamas - however repulsive its charter - is part of the Palestinian reality and will eventually have to be accommodated. Such a peace strategy would see a decision to withdraw from almost all of the West Bank and end settlement expansion, thereby making Abbas - and the peace process - credible in the eyes of his own people.  But there is no such peace strategy, only an Israeli leadership so dazzled by its own military might that it has come to believe that force is almost always the answer - and the way to avoid the toughest questions."
2,"Apparently all is well. The custodians of our civic good health have conducted a thorough examination and found nothing untoward. We are in the clear. Sir Anthony Hammond was first to give the good news. He methodically prodded and poked into the cash-for-passports affair, before declaring happily that he had found nothing ""improper"". Peter Mandelson, Keith Vaz and their numerous officials were guilty of no wrong- doing; their relationships with the Hinduja brothers were perfectly sound.  On Monday the House of Commons sleazebusting committee of MPs issued another set of exonerations, this time not quite as complete. Their probe into the earlier affairs of Mr Vaz cleared him of nine charges, finding him guilty on only one: failing to declare that a man he had nominated for inclusion in the honours' list just so happened to be a contributor to his own constituency fund. Still, that was not too serious, certainly not worthy of any punishment. The committee decided no action was necessary.  And there has been an equally cheery verdict on the weekend reports that Downing Street intervened in a controversial planning application by the billionaire arms broker, Wafic Said. Sure, an official memo spoke of ""pressure from the prime minister's office not to delay the decision"" on Said's plan to build a business school on the site of a much-loved old railway station in Oxford. But that means nothing. Number 10 insists it was merely concerned with the timing of the decision, not the decision itself. Once again, everybody behaved perfectly properly.  So given this rash of good news - confirming our public officials' complete probity and propriety - why do we feel so bad? Why is this sequence of denials, rebuttals and exonerations not good enough? If the rules say nothing wrong happened, why doesn't it feel quite right?  The answer is common sense. Forget what the reports and inquiries say; these cases are all versions of the same, all-too-familiar story: someone, somewhere got special treatment because they have money.  Hammond confirms it. Even as he insists there was no wrongdoing, he provides chapter and verse on the extraordinary efforts made in pursuit of the Hindujas' applications for British citizenship. Their forms weren't processed by some overworked staffer in the passport office - they were championed by the head of the immigration and nationality directorate himself. The rules were bent, too, so that SP Hinduja got his passport in a quarter of the normal time, even though he clearly did not meet the usual residency requirements. Watching over it all were a choir of guardian angels, from Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath to Peter Mandelson and Jack Straw, all doing their bit to make sure the Hindujas' request was dealt with ""helpfully"".  Hammond accepts all this as perfectly proper, but we don't have to. We know what it amounts to: special treatment for the wealthy. Just as we knew it when Tony Blair exempted Formula One from the ban on tobacco advertising after Bernie Ecclestone gave £1m to the Labour party. We knew it when the Tories bagged a peerage for Michael Ashcroft soon after he gave the party so much money he became their treasurer. The officials may tell us everything is ""proper""; but all that proves is their definition of ""proper"" is wrong - and we ought to get a new one.  But how? How can we stop money talking? The default response is to demand that politicians stay well clear of millionaires, by freeing them of the need to raise cash in the first place. Then Blair and William Hague wouldn't have to grovel to the likes of Ecclestone and Ashcroft. The state could fund political parties and all would be well.  Wrong. Even if state funding did not contain risks of its own - like squeezing out new movements by denying them funds - it would not solve the problem. After all, the Hindujas were not offering money to the Labour party, but to the dome. State funding would not have kept Mandelson, Blair and Straw away from them.  Accepting the presence of money in politics, but regulating it, seems the next best step. But that's what the MPs   who just cleared Vaz are meant to do - and just look how ineffective they are. They had to give up on eight additional charges against the minister because he refused to cooperate with their inquiries. They were powerless to resist.  No, we need a new, more radical solution to the problem. And we may find it in, of all places, the law.  For what is the real offence in the Hinduja case, or episodes like it? Surely it's the clear evidence that there's one rule for the rich and another for everyone else. It is a violation of our deep belief that everyone should be equal under the law. That can be more than a sentimental hope. In the United States, the 14th amendment's insistence on ""equal protection of the laws"" has formed the basis for countless civil rights actions demanding fairness and an end to discrimination. It was that clause which underpinned 1954's legendary Brown v Board of Education decision, ending the racial segregation of America's schools. It has been invoked regularly ever since, with Americans petitioning their courts to outlaw preferential treatment for one group of individuals over another.  That option is now open to us. Under a happy coincidence, we have a 14th amendment of our own: article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, now absorbed into British law as the Human Rights Act. That article bars discrimination on grounds of sex, race, colour and ""any other status."" That ""other status"" could be wealth.  Put simply, there is nothing to stop two, hypothetical Patel brothers petitioning the courts to demand why the passport request they made for their third brother was not treated as swiftly as Prakash Hinduja's. A Wafic Smith could complain that the decision on his planning project was not announced as swiftly as Wafic Said's. Bernie Bloggs could claim discrimination denied him the policy exemption that so pleased Bernie Ecclestone.  Such scenarios need not be fanciful. Leading human rights lawyer Keir Starmer says: ""The whole point of the Human Rights Act is to give protection against discrimination - and discrimination against those with less money could come within the prohibitions set out in article 14."" As long as you amassed the evidence and could prove that, say, the Patels and the Hindujas were genuinely comparable in every other respect bar riches, Starmer reckons you could make a serious challenge under the act. At the very least, it would force the discriminating authority to explain why they favoured one set of individuals over another.  The experts always told us this new law would make a big difference. In the US the bill of rights has long been used to advance civil rights, from abortion to women's status at work, that were too hot for the politicians to handle. Now it can be our turn. For those of us who are sick of the fast track and special favours granted to the rich, politicians are now too much the problem to be the solution. It may be time to go to court."
2,"The jokes about Barack Obama as saviour and messiah are wearing a little thin now. But yesterday he signalled that even if he cannot save the world he is deadly serious about changing it. By telling a town-hall-style meeting in Strasbourg that he wants ""a world without nuclear weapons"" - a theme he will develop in a major address on proliferation to be delivered in Prague tomorrow - he stunned much of the usually sceptical diplomatic fraternity. Not because the statement was entirely new: Obama said the same thing as a candidate, including before a vast crowd in Berlin last July. But candidates say lots of things. Few believed that Obama, once elected, would seriously try to pursue such an idealistic, even utopian ambition. Yet on this first trip overseas, and despite all the multiple pressures on him at home, the new president has given every indication he means business.  The breakthrough he made in his first face-to-face encounter with his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, in London on Wednesday was precisely in this area - with the two leaders agreeing in principle to slash their nuclear arsenals, probably by a third. Obama advisers explain that the US and others cannot plausibly pressure Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions if they do not honour the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - which calls on all existing nuclear powers to work towards disarmament. Until now any acknowledgement of that obligation was mere lip-service. But Obama's words and deeds over the last 72 hours suggest the US approach to that treaty has now changed. And that is far from the only shift. Every aspect of Obama's conduct on this European tour marks a radical departure from the immediate past. While George Bush's administration usually appeared to be laying down the law to its supposed partners - ""You're either with us or with the terrorists"" - Obama has stressed that he is keen, as he put it yesterday, to ""listen and learn from our friends and allies"". His entire approach to the G20 was a break from the go-it-alone unilateralism associated most intensely with Bush's first term. Obama spoke and acted as a multilateralist. So he admitted that the US had not got everything its own way at the London summit, adding that that was how it should be in the 21st century. ""If there's just Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's an easier negotiation,"" the president said. ""But that's not the world we live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in."" Instead he referred to the US as a ""peer"" of its fellow G20 members, bowing to French and German demands for tighter regulation of international finance. On that last point, he reportedly acted as a conciliator, cooling down a simmering dispute over tax havens between the presidents of France and China, taking each of them to one side, in the corner of the negotiating room.  It is hard to imagine that role - of US as honest broker and umpire - being played by Obama's predecessor. After eight years in which Washington seemed disdainful of the rest of the world, dismissing France and Germany as ""old Europe"", Obama's warmth in both countries yesterday represented another sharp shift.  Six years ago, the US Congress ordered French fries to be renamed ""freedom fries"". Yesterday Obama was mobbed on the streets of Strasbourg and engaged in a mutual love-in with Nicolas Sarkozy. The president seems to have been at pains to show both humility, admitting past US ""arrogance"", and respect for the other nations of the world.  At his London press conference, he went out of his way to call on ""foreign"" journalists, before hastily correcting himself with a smile. ""Actually, I'm the foreigner here,"" he said."
2,"By now, we should be feeling pretty good about ourselves. Even if we did not sit through the inevitable newsreaders-in-drag sketches or EastEnders spoofs last night, we will be glad when the BBC announces today that its TV and radio marathon has once again raised a record sum for Children in Need.    No one can seriously be against it. Even those who can't bear the sight of self-satisfied celebrities promoting their careers and calling it charity will still be pleased at the outcome. After all, children are the one group on whom we can all agree. When Gordon Brown wants to redistribute wealth he does not talk about handing cash to the poor, only of slashing ""child poverty"". The calculation is quite straightforward: while some might have little sympathy for poor adults, everyone takes pity on poor children. We all like kids.  Except maybe we don't. For there is too much evidence all around us, from our shops to our schools and shot through popular culture, that we are becoming a society that does not look after, and perhaps does not even like, children.   At its mildest, it's the shock any visitor from continental Europe or America has at the unwelcome we give to kids here. It can be formal: the ""Sorry, no children"" signs that still, incredibly, bar families from public restaurants. Or informal: the glares rather than smiles meted out to kids on buses or shops or cafes. It seems the Victorian attitude to kids, that they are to be seen but not heard, is stubbornly persistent.   At its most extreme, there is the staggering degree of pain inflicted on children every day. The numbing statistics are that each week at least one child will die as a result of an adult's cruelty; a quarter of all recorded rape victims are children; a recent NSPCC survey found one in 10 young adults had suffered serious abuse or neglect in childhood. Of course this is not peculiar to Britain, but any society that tolerates violence on this scale has to wonder if our claimed affection for the young is a veneer - and what lies beneath.   For even in those places far away from the darkness of abuse, in broad daylight, we are committing a crime against children. It is the crime of theft: we are stealing their childhood.   Of course it is essential that British kids can read, write and add up and that we know what standards they have reached. And, yes, that takes time. But too many primary school classrooms have been turned into assembly lines, as teachers are forced to drill their charges in literacy and numeracy, for hour after hour. Children desperate to let their imagination run free, to play, draw or run around are being turned into little box-ticking machines that can pass tests and make the Sats grade. They complain of boredom, as the joy of childhood is squeezed out of them.   We can hardly blame the schools; they are doing what they are told. Besides, the wider culture is up to the same game - depriving kids of their youth. A current TV vogue is for shows which make children into mini-adults, for our entertainment. It can be kitsch horrors like the Junior Eurovision Song Contest or a Stars in their Eyes ""kids special"" where the sight of a hair-gelled nine-year-old, in a shrunk-down version of his dad's suit, can make your stomach churn. The people behind this dreck would borrow the pornographers' argument, and tell you the kids enjoy it. But the pleasure seems to be confined to the whooping, air-punching parents in the audience, as pushy as the stagedoor mothers of old, willing their child to victory - and to imagined riches for their own pockets.   But let's not be snobbish about this. Upstream from ITV1 trash is E4, Channel 4's digital sister. It would doubtless cite ""irony"" in defence of its Little Friends comedy show, which blends the techniques of Trigger Happy TV and Ali G with a new twist. The people duping unsuspecting interviewees, or stopping strangers in the street, are not adult comedians but children. One episode saw a young girl asking three men in the street to hold up placards: one featured a graffiti-style drawing of a phallus. The same girl was then shown interviewing an elderly gay couple, asking them about their sex lives and beginning one question, ""My Dad says he'd bet his cock... ""   This horrible little programme is queasy in more than one way. It rests on the hope that an adult audience will share a toddler's sense of humour and find something funny in hearing a child use rude words (one boy is required to slip four-letter words into an interview with Michael Caine). It takes a childish need - to pretend to be a grown-up and to take risks - and exploits it for our titillation. Little Friends (slogan: Children in Need... of a slap!) has a whiff of the dirty mac in its demand that a young schoolgirl approach male strangers and ask for help. And it turns children into adults, knowing and ironic. It steals from them and steals from us, by asking us to see kids differently: to see them as old before their years.   Predictably, it is in the sexual sphere that the crime of childhood-robbery is most prevalent and most dispiriting. It can be the teen magazines, whose editors insist provide healthy, valuable sex education - but which look sleazy and pressuring to the naked eye. ""Why don't you have a boyfriend,"" nags Cosmo Girl!, average age of reader: 14. Inside it offers this useful instructive tale: ""He wants sex 24/7... I love him and don't want to lose him."" And J-17, whose average reader is 15, with its sex surveys and its ""seven ways to make him come back for more"". The advice inside may actually be useful, even responsible, and there is no doubt that some girls have genuine anxiety about either having sex or not having it - but these magazines are making good money out of that angst.    Or it can be the new US-made Bratz dolls, which have edged out Barbie to win the hearts of eight-year-old girls. In their crop tops, tiny waists and huge breasts, they are miniature J-Los and Beyoncs. They are sexualised, and so cannot help but sexualise the children who play with them. As Miriam Arond, the editor of Child magazine, told the New York Times, the Bratz mirror ""a society in which we're treating really young children as if they were much older"".   It's hard to work out what's behind this, why we might want to steal our kids' childhood before they're ready to let go. But we must get some kind of kick out of it. How else to explain the recent fashion magazine spread featuring a model who certainly looked no older than 12, with a man's hand reaching towards her nipple? Or the Chapman Brothers' trademark mutant infant mannequin, sporting an erect penis, anus or vagina where its nose, mouth or ear should be. Calling these pieces ""Fuckface"" or ""Two-Faced Cunt"" seems to be playing the same trick: casting children as sexual objects.   For artists and magazine editors, this doubtless seems terribly cutting-edge. They are slashing taboos, unafraid to expose the sexuality of the young. But I don't see it that way. I see them as part of a wider malaise, one that is stripping away the protective layer that should insulate children from the appetites, neuroses and lusts of adults. Children are indeed in need - of a society that will care for them properly."
0,"For once in this war, our newspapers have spoken with the same voice. Saddam's taste in palaces is universally considered lamentable. From the Times (""part Alhambra, part Barratt home"") to the Mirror (""decadent opulence""), from the Sun (""garish"") to the Mail (""obscene""), war correspondents have united in merciless judgment on the dictator's interior design, apparently stunned, as they had not been by his hundreds of self-glorifying murals and equestrian statues, by Saddam's more private fondness for gilt, mirrors and marble, his love of entwined Ss and Hs, his perfectly dreadful, lottery-winner's gold taps. If only, you gather, he had spent his stolen oil money on something simpler, less wicked-looking - Philippe Starck? Conran, even? - how different might his place in history have been. Shuddering squaddies evidently endorsed their verdict. ""It really is an eye-opener,"" observed one Royal Marine. ""This is what he spent his money on."" Another condemned ""the sheer degree of utter waste"".  It seems a fair bet then, that neither combatant is a member of the National Trust. For those familiar with the ostentation peculiar to the British stately, some of Saddam's decor will have looked positively plain. Why, they may wonder, did he go for those beigey marble walls in the Basra palace when he could have draped them in, say, a lovely rich watered silk, to show up a mahogany case of gorgeous 18th-century porcelain, or some French inlaid cabinets, or a couple of marble and gold credenzas? Wouldn't a spot of scarlet damask on the chairs have looked a shade more imperial, when reflected in the mirrors, than the neutral executive stuff on which the American sergeant lolled with a fag? No accounting for taste.  But there is no need to join the NT to see where Saddam found all his best ideas, from swank architraves to chandeliers to pattern, pattern, pattern. They do it brilliantly at Buckingham Palace. And if Hello! readers turn to page four of the current issue they will find a feature on the gilded, fretted, plushy interiors of Highclere Castle, in which most aspects of Saddam style receive a ringing endorsement from ""the ancestral home of the Herbert family"". Similar furnishings can also be bought readymade, from Harrods.  Although he is in other respects a man of singular wickedness, Saddam's notions of the sort of homes befitting a homicidal thieving dictator appear to have been entirely conventional. Like everyone from the Roman emperors to the Marcoses and Ceaucescus and, more recently, our very own lord chancellor, he apparently believed ""he could not perform his sacred function in the eyes of his subjects without the pampered splendour which surrounded his existence in the capital"" (as Jerome Carcopino described the Caesars' dutifully conspicuous consumption).  In this country, the belief that high office should find both its reward and reflection in palatial splendour persists with the offer of mansions such as Chequers and Dorneywood to our political leaders, who generally show every sign of appreciating the gesture. So much so, in Robin Cook's case, that he could hardly bear to quit Carlton Gardens for Dollis Hill.  And so much so, in Derry Irvine's, that one can readily imagine British squaddies wandering around his continually refurbished apartments, tutting at the custom-built toilet and marvelling at the kind of vulgar beast who could live in such swaggering fashion at the expense of the comparative beggars outside his palace gates.   <B>In for a nude shock</B>Britain's formidable army of nudists, or ""naturists"" as they style themselves these days, is agitating against the government's new sexual offences bill, in particular the section concerned with indecent exposure. Yesterday Mick Ayers, a Unison official who is also chairman of the Central Council of British Naturism, told MPs that the sexual offences bill in its current form might also restrict the activities of wholesome, guaranteed non-pervert nudists of the type generally seen strutting up and down British beaches just as nature intended - save for their beanie hats, socks and stout sandals. ""There is a need,"" Ayers explained, ""to differentiate between a very moral and proper   way of life which is a family activity, and those who do such things for sexual gratification"".  The fears of Ayers and his fellow enthusiasts have not, it appears, been allayed by calming letters from the leading government textile (as clothes-wearers are known in nudist circles) Hillary Benn and prominent silk, Lord Charles Falconer of Thoroton. Both ministers insist that the bill ""criminalises cases of exposure causing alarm or distress. Not naturists, or streakers"".   Actually, if I were a naturist I would not be reassured either. For however wholesome we ought to find the sight of men like Ayers naked as the day he was born, though somewhat larger, there will always be some who are genuinely alarmed and distressed by the prospect of unclothed strangers on public beaches, even those who wonder what, other than seedy exhibitionism, might motivate those who wish to display themselves in this way.  Of course, it is good to know from Ayers' organisation that ""Nudity in sun clubs is not sexually stimulating"". Even so, an advertisement on the same website, for the French nudist colony, Cap D'Agde (""there are many shops where the girls can buy lingerie not normally available in the boutiques at home"") cannot but remind some of us of a passage in Michel Houellebecq's novel, Atomised, in which the priapic anti-hero, Bruno, describes the easygoing, orgiastic welcome the resort offers to its predominantly northern European clientele: ""Though it boasted three shopping centres, a mini-golf course and bicycle rental, the primary attractions for holidaymakers at the Cap d'Agde colony were sex and sunbathing"".  While one readily accepts that the average British nudist is more likely to resemble Unison's   Mick than Houellebecq's Bruno, there is, alas, when one meets one in a public place, no way of distinguishing the noble savage from the leering satyr who enjoys being in a place where ""voyeurism is tactily condoned"".  So unless some instant guarantee of nudist propriety, other than emasculation, presents itself, it seems likely that Lord Charles may indeed distinguish himself, not before time, as the hammer of nudists, with a law requiring that they pursue their hobby out of sight. Either that, or they must be very, very brave, and put on their swimsuits.  <B>Charles gets sheepish</B>Lady Helen Windsor is no longer the face of Bulgari, a jewellery company. It appears Bulgari no   longer thinks it worthwhile paying her £1m a year to show its wares at parties. Or perhaps Fay Weldon's novel, The Bulgari Connection, did the job better. Whatever the reason, this split, like those between Isabella Rossellini and Liz Hurley, respective former faces of Lancome and Estee Lauder, provides another reminder to those who aspire to such work, that it should not be considered a long-term career option.  Unless, that is, you are clever enough, like the Prince of Wales, to pair your promotional efforts with a product, such as mutton, that can only ever benefit from the association. Indeed, the only possible objection to the prince assuming his new, voluntary role as the Face of Mutton is that it deprives so many of our more mature princesses and models of a job they could truly grow into."
0,"A few years ago, Susie Orbach launched a campaign called Antidote, with the aim of bringing ""emotional literacy"" into British public life. Tessa Jowell was a signatory. Antidote's idea, Orbach explained, was to ""widen the political vocabulary so that emotions are open, not hidden"". To judge by last week's political performances, Antidote has succeeded marvellously. Not only were we treated to displays of unrestrained exultation, we were addressed by the prime minister in the language that marriage guidance counsellors use on their clients. ""What this does,"" said Blair, after receiving his second, adequately ornate apology, ""is allow us to draw a line and move on."" The prime minister's spokesman, John Cleese to his Robin Skynner, also hinted at feelings that run too deep for triumphalist press conferences: ""It is time, as he said, to move on."" It can't be long before they collaborate on a self-help book: Wars and How to Survive Them. Meanwhile, Alastair Campbell also wants us to move on, and Tessa Jowell, once a psychiatric social worker, has hailed Hutton for enabling the Kelly family to ""achieve closure"". And urged the BBC to ""move on"". It is a measure of her professional skills that some patients already feel ready to comply. ""We've got to move on,"" agrees BBC2's Jane Root.  What, however, is to become of those of us who, were we to lie on    Blair's couch, might describe ourselves as having ""some work to do""? Or as ""stuck""? Or even, in some extreme cases, as victims of recurrent nightmares, for whom it seems that the hideous flashbacks of Blair and Campbell's grinning faces will never, ever go away? Since Hutton, I am assured, it is not unusual for people to feel hurt and let down, isolated and confused, unable to trust. We may feel that the world is an unfair   place; so much so that there is no point in voting next time round. Will we ever learn to love again?  For anyone who feels similarly at a loss, and in the absence of further guidance from the Downing Street therapy unit, perhaps I could recommend Dr Ann Macaskill's helpful book, Heal the Hurt: How to Forgive and Move On (Sheldon Press, £6.99). Dr Macaskill understands how hard it can be to get over things,   even when the prime minister, his pet bully and the culture secretary are all telling you it's essential. ""In the course of my professional life,"" she says, ""I have seen many people harbouring hurts that they have carried for years."" But we should ask ourselves if the pain is worth it. ""Is holding a grudge, nursing a hurt, really worth the associated pain, the feeling of being stuck in the past, unable to move on?""   In all probability, she says, the person who hurt you is ""getting on with their life, seldom giving you a second thought"". Blair, for instance, is already on his next inquiry. Campbell is writing a sports column. Jowell is busy telling everyone off.  Forgiveness, Macaskill explains, is a process we can complete for ourselves, even in the absence of any apology - but ""we have to be willing to work at it"". She suggests various strategies for people who want to move on, such as thinking of all the good times you had with the perpetrator of your pain. You might, for example, want to think about Blair's promise not to introduce tuition fees. His vision of a reformed House of Lords. The thing about being his brother's keeper.  For some people, of course, such therapy may only bring up further pain. Why, they may feel, do politicians arrogate the language of counselling, and with such patent insincerity? For they must know that ""moving on"" is not, according to the therapists who coined the expression, to be achieved overnight, but only after the laborious contemplation of what you are leaving behind. That ""closure"", even if it were a desirable condition and not the most abject of counselling cliches, is not something you can claim for another person, family or institution. Do they perhaps feel that saying, ""It's time to move on"" sounds more attractive than what they mean, ie: ""I've won, so bugger off""? If so, we can only conclude, in the face of such self-deception, that many, many years of unflinching self-examination lie ahead.   <B>Rennie, the BBC's cure-all</B><BR>  Who is Dame Rennie Fritchie, the woman whose name now constitutes the government's all-purpose answer to any questions about the chairmanship of the BBC? Interrogated on Monday about the selection procedure, Tessa Jowell repeatedly assured the Commons that Dame Rennie would see us right. She would be ""guarantor for the fairness of the process"". And who, asked one suspicious Tory, would write Dame Rennie's guarantee? Why, Tessa retorted, ""Those will all be matters for Dame Rennie."" In the culture secretary's circles, you gather, Rennie Fritchie, the commissioner for public appointments, passes for the very fount of probity and disinterest. Or, as Tessa put it: ""Given   that Dame Rennie Fritchie has undertaken to discharge the oversight responsibility, we have to be confident of the enhanced independence of the process.""  If lamentably few people had ever heard of this prodigy before Jowell's announcement, it is scarcely the fault of Dame Rennie, who, it turns out, prides herself on being a ""portfolio worker"", for whom being a four-day-a-week commissioner (for a well-deserved £126,000 per annum) is but one of a vast array of positions, honours and emoluments too long to list here. Suffice it to say that she is also Northern Ireland's commissioner for public appointments, a ""consultant on Strategy and Leadership"", honorary visiting professor with a   chair in creative leadership at York University, non-executive director of the Stroud and Swindon Building Society, pro chancellor of Southampton University, a ""much sought-after coach and mentor"", author of Resolving Conflicts in Organisations and inventor of the ""wild west view of consultancy"".  Even as she bestrides the public and commercial sectors like a colossus, Dame Rennie finds time to share her thoughts on leadership, assertiveness, time management and creative thinking. Some indication of the quality of guidance she might, if called upon, be able to offer the privy councillors in their search for a replacement chairman, emerges in a recent lecture on ""leadership and partnership"". The leader's role, says Dame Rennie, is ""to choose the right thing - to show the way, set the direction of travel"". She continues: ""It seems to me that    having the ability to fly at 30,000ft, to see the biggest overarching picture, to know when to drop down to 20,000ft, 10,000ft and where to land and walk is a prerequisite for choosing the right thing."" Having walked about, and also, perhaps, checked into an executive suite, unpacked his or her case and investigated the minibar, the leader must also listen to ""the five unspoken employee requests"", such as ""Acknowledge the greatness within me""; and know how to learn from his or her misjudgments. ""As leaders we  enjoy success but we  learn from mistakes."" Unless, of course, we work for the BBC, in which case we are  forced to resign.  Dame Rennie illustrates the leader's need for Balance with a poem of her own: If Life Is a Circus: Who's Laughing? ""With the children a juggler I became/Kids, work, home, no two days the same   ... Now in my 50s, I finally hold the ring/In my three-ring circus balance is everything.""  There are practical hints, too, acquired from ""my own Leadership Roles"", which may be of interest to anyone applying for the BBC chairmanship. For example, draw a square, divide it into four, and fill each box with a list of ""allies, opponents, bedfellows and enemies"". Here's another precept: ""Human beings may appear to be separate, but our connections are deep and we are inseparable."" Candidates might also wish to memorise the 13 leadership principles Rennie picked up from Colin Powell. These include ""It can be done!"", ""Get mad, then get over it!"", and ""Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision."" Does the last one still seem such a good idea? That, Jowell would no doubt remind us, is entirely a matter for Dame Rennie."
0,"Mindful of the desire of the new commissioner for children, Professor Al Aynsley-Green, for all young people in England to know of his existence, I told the nearest child that she now had her own, dedicated tsar, one determined to raise debate ""on the construct of children and childhood in society"". He was ready and apparently eager to hear her views. On any subject. Children's participation would be vital to his work. Within a few minutes, the first letter was ready for forwarding. ""To the childrens zar"" [it began], ""I think we should have loads more sweets and crisps. Sincerely, A Kid."" The second letter requested longer school holidays, the third no more homework, and the fourth, more pizza restaurants.  Given the Zar's record, you feel that he might not be entirely unsympathetic to proposals that would make the world a better place for year 3. After all, as he this week told children at a London primary school, he voluntarily watches Dick and Dom. A couple of years ago, as the government's clinical director for children, he suggested that children in hospital should be tempted with snack boxes including crisps and chocolate. There was no point in offering guacamole, he pointed out; the children wouldn't eat it: ""I make no apology for including a Mars bar and crisps, because it's what children like.""    Sadly for his client base, Professor Aynsley-Green is not empowered to hold back the tide of guacamole now advancing from Jamie Oliver's busy blender, in order to replace it with his own crisp and Mars bar snack boxes. Actually, looking at his role as children's commissioner, he appears to have very few powers at all.   He will not, for example, be able to help individual children from being put in custody in Britain, where, as the UN pointed out last year, 27 of them have died since 1990. He cannot stop badly behaved 10-year-olds from being named and shamed on the front pages of their local paper, with the encouragement of the home secretary, who warned young misbehavers this week, ""Your photo could be all over the local media; your local community will know who you are ....""   Similarly, it will be beyond him to protect children from being assaulted by their parents, who are authorised under the government's recently introduced moderate-slapping legislation to use violence against minors (including babies) as long as they don't leave marks. With the wisdom that comes of   having presided over the Islington children's homes scandal, the children's minister, Margaret Hodge, reassured everyone last year that ""there is a world of difference between a light smack and violence and abuse"". No doubt many of the children whose aggressive, prematurely sexualised, ""challenging"" behaviour was described by Ofsted this week would applaud this recognition that a little light violence is only to be expected when tempers get frayed.   In an opening contribution to his debate on the ""construct of children and childhood in society"", Aynsley-Smith observed that English society lacks a ""warmth"" towards children evident in other European countries. Though the popularity of programmes offering advice on child-rearing and the emergence of celebrity nannies such as Gina Powell and Jo Frost surely suggests that parents nowadays are not so much cold as   anxious and confused about how to engage with their children. And why shouldn't they be, when you consider the government's simultaneous support for child-whacking (Mr Blair has personally endorsed the loving smack) and persecution of little blighters who go round frightening other people?   If the commissioner's job is designed to stop him placing boundaries on such lamentably inconsistent behaviour, he is at least empowered to represent the views of its victims. Do our children feel better for a good slap? Would they like to eat more guacamole? Is there anything about being a child now that the children's commissioner really ought to know? We would be interested in your children's thoughts; contributions welcome at the usual address."
0,"The Daily Mail despairs of Cherie Blair. True, even when the woman passed for semi-rational, it never had much time for her, but in the past week, dismayed by her appetite for the manifestly bogus, the paper has focused repeatedly on what an editorial called her ""lack of judgment"". Lynda Lee-Potter diagnosed her as ""gullible, bordering on the cranky when it comes to alternative medicine, homeopathy, gurus and the power of crystals and rocks"". And in a special investigation of this gullible borderline crank ""the Weird World of Cherie"" went into disdainful detail about her allegedly ""increasing"" dependence on a Dorking-based medium called Sylvia. ""The fact that the prime minister's wife faxes questions to the spirit world is at best bizarre, but at worst deeply worrying,"" wrote Paul Harris. ""What's she going to ask them? Should we go to war with Iraq? It is rather an unusual way to organise your future.""  It most certainly is. But no more so, perhaps, than the Daily Mail's own enthusiasm for another purveyor of occult intelligence, one Michael Drosnin, author of a pre-millennium bestseller called The Bible Code. Throughout the week, alongside bulletins from the weird world of Cherie, the Mail has been treating its readers to lengthy extracts from Drosnin's sequel, Bible Code 2: The Countdown, in which the author rounds up a few scary predictions he forgot to mention earlier. For him, as for so many other professional purveyors of doom, September 11 came as thrilling confirmation that the Apocalypse is - hadn't they told us so all along? - a conflagration just waiting to happen. ""All the evidence seems to suggest that the globe will be in a state of perpetual conflict until the year 2006... ""  His threats concluded yesterday with the clinching revelation that the bible code is the work of visiting aliens, who ""arrived here on Earth in a spacecraft"". It is thanks to them, the Daily Mail presumably believes, that Drosnin is now able to share the warnings of al-Qaida's activities which he discovered in the aftermath of 9/11. ""First, the Bible Code predicted the attacks on the Twin Towers"", it trumpeted on Monday's front page, alongside a handy aide memoire: a mugshot of Bin Laden. ""Now, it warns of nuclear war. Dare we ignore this message?"" Ooh, I don't know. As Harris puts it, it does seem ""rather an unusual way to organise your future"".  Like Cherie, whose relationship with her medium is described as ""decidedly long-term"", the Daily Mail's reliance on Drosnin and his team of gifted aliens goes back a while, to 1997, when it serialised his first, highly successful attempt to use the bible codes to cash in on premillennial tension. His technique, borrowed from a devout Israeli mathematician, is to search   for names ""hidden"" in the Bible, using a computer to try out equidistant letter sequences. It may be, the Torah being so very long, that it contains a lot of interesting stuff about Lynda Lee-Potter or Alan Partridge, but being a serious person, Drosnin stuck to searching for politicians. When he searched for Yitzhak Rabin, for instance, the name duly surfaced, with the letters spaced 4,772 characters apart. Once the letters have been arranged on a grid, in whatever direction - upwards, diagonally, backwards - turns out to be most rewarding, bible code experts then search the surrounding text for phrases or words that might offer added prophetic meaning.  Clinton, for instance, could be made to appear near ""hidden secret, lover of maidservant"". Drosnin was exultant. ""That's as close as the Old Testament gets to 'young female intern'. Rabin, on the other hand, could be made to intersect with the Hebrew words ""a murderer who   murders"". Thus it is Drosnin's boast to have predicted Rabin's murder. His prediction of Netanyahu's assassination is less often advertised. Trying to locate the exact date of Armageddon, back in 1997, proved equally tricky. ""There is no way to know whether the code is predicting a war in 2000 or 2006,"" he decided. ""The year 2000 is encoded twice, but 2006 is mathematically the best match."" Can't be too careful, eh?  Defending this codswallop back in 1997, Drosnin said: ""When my critics find a message about the assassination of a prime minister encrypted in Moby Dick, I'll believe them. An enterprising Australian computer scientist called Brendan McKay promptly used the bible codes technique on Moby Dick to find the names of a variety of assassinated prime ministers, including Indira Gandhi, Rene Moawad, Abraham Lincoln and Yitzhak Rabin. Sadly, a search of Moby Dick also predicted Michael Drosnin's own death, by a nail through the heart: ""Mr Drosnin will be killed either in Cairo or Athens. Probably both places will play a part, but our skills in reading the secret codes are not yet advanced enough to say more.""  In 1999, McKay also co-authored a comprehensive repudiation of the bible codes in the journal Statistical Science. ""A brief summary of the result of our very extensive investigation"", he writes, ""is that all the alleged scientific evidence for the codes is bunk."" A view resoundingly endorsed in a ""Mathematicians' Statement on the Bible Codes"", available on the net, in which scores of academics, including John Allen Paulos, agree that ""the almost unanimous opinion of those in the scientific world who have studied the question is that the theory is without foundation.""  The pages of the Daily Mail, however, inhabit a quite different, Cherie-style universe, whose laws allow for Drosnin's many critics to be blithely ignored or baselessly discredited. ""Many people scoffed,"" says the paper, ""until they saw the astonishing array of modern events spelled out in the ancient Hebrew letters."" With Drosnin also rewriting the past - ""the case for the code has just kept getting stronger"" - many of the Mail's more gullible readers may now be considering cashing in their endowment policies. For unless Drosnin can locate the aliens' code from its resting place under the Dead Sea, it seems that our lives will probably end horribly in 2006. Photographs of Bin Laden, gas masks and burning towers offer a few, surpassingly tasteless hints of what we can expect. Maybe a nuclear holocaust, Drosnin speculates, or ""a plague that could kill one-third of the world's population"". Hard to say. Whatever it is, only he knows where the aliens left the key ""to unlock the code and see our entire future"", but the King of Jordan won't let him investigate! ""Time is running out - fast... ""  Is it? Crikey. If consulting the dead were not such a deplorably gullible and cranky thing to do, one might almost be tempted to get a second opinion from Cherie's spirit guide in Dorking. Does Sylvia accept inquiries from the general public, as well as the prime minister's wife? If so, I have two questions. Should we go to war with Iraq? And can we believe anything we read in the Daily Mail?"
0,"Barbara Cassani, the American woman leading Britain's bid to stage the Olympics, says that there is absolutely no truth in a report, run prominently in the Daily Telegraph this week, that she had been invited to dinner with Mr Blair, and found, ""to be frank, he wasn't that bright"". The newspaper alleged that Cassani continued, ""He took an interest in what I was saying, and has this ability to make it seem as if he cares, but he didn't seem particularly knowledgeable about anything ... his responses to my questions were slow."" She is also supposed to have noted the prime minister's very marked enthusiasm for the siting of beach volleyball on an area of Whitehall conveniently adjacent to his office window (a ""masterstroke"" of planning, he recently called it, in a public, somewhat heavy-handed appeal to the floating phwooaar! vote).  It is unfortunate for Cassani, whose lawyers are demanding a full and complete apology from the Telegraph, that these alleged observations on Blair's mental debility should have appeared so soon after the singer George Michael described what happened after he, too, accepted Blair's invitation to dinner in 1997. George said he found him ""a really nice guy ... What worried me most was that he didn't seem the smartest man at the table.""  A bit steep, you might think, coming from a man whose boon companions include Geri Halliwell and her dog, Harry. Then again, Michael's comments only echo Doris Lessing's verdict. Last year she said, ""He believes in magic. That if you say a thing, it is true. I think he's not very bright in some ways."" And not very cultivated either, according to VS Naipaul, who has blamed Blair for imposing an ""aggressively plebeian culture that celebrates itself for being plebeian"".  No doubt Blair will accept Cassani's assurance that she in fact holds him ""in very high regard"". It would be difficult to find a new Olympic champion now, and, besides, even if she had said it (which she didn't!) being called stupid would probably make a nice change from being called mad or, more recently, moribund. Last year Blair was repeatedly diagnosed as mentally ill, not only by amateur clinicians such as Matthew Parris, who found evidence of someone ""stark, staring mad"", but by the concerned professionals quoted in Prospect and the New Statesman, who, between them, detected evidence of the psychopathic, the delusional, and other interesting varieties of pathological behaviour.  For some reason - possibly because so many powerful calmatives are now available - the allegations of insanity do not seem to have prompted any talk of lawyers and apologies and setting the record straight. Even though there was every reason to think this supposed lunatic would have passed all the tests - such as spelling ""world"" backwards and   counting in sevens - used to establish mental illness by NHS psychiatrists.  It is difficult, on the other hand, to see how the prime minister could now defend himself against Michael's and Lessing's observations. Even if he sat an intelligence test. The contention that he is not mad, so much as dull-witted, is so apt an explanation for all the idiotic things he has done to squander his majority and compromise his reputation - from bodging reform of the Lords to falling out with the judges, from befriending Carole Caplin to alienating half of Europe - that it seems extraordinary it has not been advanced more often, and more forcefully.  Admittedly we are familiar with the line that the prime minister is less intelligent than his wife. And less intelligent than his old leadership rivals Gordon Brown and Robin Cook. And less intelligent, as a public schoolboy, educated within an inch of his life, than the brilliant, grammar-school boys with Oxbridge firsts who used to dominate Labour politics. And less intelligent than the political advisers whose job it is to write his   speeches and tell him about the third way and dream up ""eye-catching initiatives"". Even so, one took it pretty much for granted that he was not actually dim. On the contrary. ""Bright"" was the word generally applied, when his grin first appeared glinting on the horizon.  If he did not always dazzle, rhetorically or in mental agility, then one supposed it was because Blair, being so modern, saw the importance, in this deeply intellectual-averse country, of demonstrating the common touch. Hence all the easy-to-understand turns about glasses being half-full, about the smiles on sick kiddies' faces and reverse gears and the surpassing loveliness of the beach volleyball player. Only recently has it seemed possible that this persistent vegetative state might be involuntary. Blair really hasn't got any ideas left. He really was impressed by the football-mad thug, Alastair Campbell. Left to himself he writes speeches such as his hysterical Sedgefield apologia, in which he justified invading Iraq on the basis that this was what he decided to do at the time. ""Iraq in March 2003 was an immensely difficult judgment. It was divisive because it was difficult."" Not so: simple things can be divisive too. It was divisive because a great many people thought he was plain wrong, and the evidence he supplied to persuade them subsequently turned out to be false.  In the absence of coherent policies, plans, arguments, the word ""judgment"" seems to appeal to Blair as synonymous with rightness. Or with justice. Which, of course, it would be, if he were God. In an interview for Saga magazine last year, he said, ""When I was young, I paid more regard to intellect than judgment. As I've got older, I pay more regard to judgment than intellect."" As if the two were alternatives. Since then, anyway, Blair seems to have moved on again. What he really pays regard to, these days, is beach volleyball. <B>Save time - read about TV</B>If only Sex and the City could end, finally and for ever, a bit more often. What with the contributions, for and against, from top career women including Mrs Conrad Black, the lively debates about how far it has, or has not changed/reflected women's sex lives, and the continuation of the story, by means of Amanda Platell, in the Daily Mail, the obsequies have been as enjoyable as they are instructive. With the end of this series, it became obvious that you could have missed every one of its scores of episodes without ever paying the price in terms of ignorance, followed by social exclusion and low self-esteem. Now that broadsheet as well as tabloid newspapers are disposed to treat television characters as no less newsworthy for being completely made up - rather more so, in fact, since they are prettier and live more eventful lives - nobody, even people without televisions, need be at a loss during those brief but challenging periods when a programme becomes essential viewing, before it goes on to join Thirtysomething, Cold Feet and Friends in televisual oblivion.   It is the work of a moment to absorb a tribute, or critique dedicated to Carrie and the three imaginary friends who have helped the shoe-crazy figment through good scripts and bad, yet such summaries offer instant authority should you suddenly find yourself lashed to a watercooler and forced to contribute to a discussion of, say, That Controversial Ending. Was the made-up baby obsession a patronising sell-out or a fair   reflection of what the average non-existent young baggage really wants once she reaches a certain, invented age? The drift towards fiction has its compensations. Anyone who read, rather than watched Sex and the City, Ally McBeal, Friends, Seinfeld, Frasier, Cheers and Thirtysomething will have managed to stay quite as fascinating as the genuine enthusiast, while effectively extending their life by around six weeks."
0,"What makes them do it? Abject need? Or, as some claim, a simple, honest desire to make money quickly and without fuss, no matter how disagreeable the clients and practices involved? Whatever the reasons that intelligent, often highly qualified women decide, apparently of their own free will, to work in the City, there can be no doubt that it is an unforgivably brutish and sexist environment. Not quite so brutal, one imagines, as the average British police force or burger house, men's lifestyle magazine or innovative new ""mini-brothel"" - nor yet as sexist as the Church of England Synod - but still: ghastly.For a highly developed appreciation of this ghastliness we are indebted to a succession of City employees, without whose descriptions - conventionally issued in the course of a dispute about discrimination, or unfair dismissal - many of us might still think of the place as a model equal opportunities employer, as committed to living its values in the workplace as it is to the causes of anti-globalisation and making poverty history.The pioneer in this respect was, of course, Nicola Horlick, whom we first encountered in 1997, adroitly manipulating the press in order to transform some arcane but faintly grubby dispute about poaching staff into a more elevated moral issue. One which was never to be fully explained, but clearly related to the talented, irreproachable nature of a super-person such as Ms Horlick, whose five equally blameless children were regularly offered for photography. Entranced reporters followed Horlick to Frankfurt and back, loyally noting every cry of ""I will be heard"" and ""Justice will be done"", and recording her solemn vow to ""undo the great wrong that has been done against me"".Was it ever undone? One forgets. At any rate, although plucky Horlick went on to recover from her Frankfurt ordeal (with the near-miraculous rapidity to be expected from the Jeanne D'Arc of fund management), some of her successors have required prodigious sums of money to alleviate the great wrongs done to them, which have ranged from bullying (by both sexes) and spitting, to disrespectful name-calling (eg, ""hot totty"") and innumerable lapdancing-related incidents.Arguably, since these affronts continue unabated, the compensation awards have been nowhere near high enough. This week - in an entertaining re-enactment of Horlick's martyrdom-spectacle, Claire Bright demanded &pound;11m to help her get over being - allegedly - mistreated by a man at HBOS, where she earned &pound;600,000 a year as a head of asset management. Perhaps (it's unclear how this figure was arrived at), she has been rendered entirely unfit to manage assets by her year working for a man she described as ""a mini Hitler"" - presumably because, given the relatively small size of a City office compared with Nazi Germany, a mini-Holocaust was the most he was able to achieve at HBOS.For many of us, having encountered nothing more in our careers than bog-standard levels of bullying, sexism and offensiveness, the suffering endured by Ms Bright in her year at HBOS may be impossible to imagine. We can only feel relief that it does not approach the slights and setbacks sustained by the six women bankers at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (a top company, apparently, recently acclaimed as ""Best Debt House - Ukraine 2004""), who are currently demanding collective compensation of &pound;800m. Offences against them ranged from one being hailed as ""the Pamela Anderson of trading"" to others having to work in a place where a ""married chief executive openly dated his personal assistant"".Evidently, the issue here is not the women's suffering, which remains incalculable, but the size of their award. Is &pound;130m per Dresdner banker really enough? If the past few years of compensation claims have taught us anything, it is that, when they are not bullies, people who go into the City are likely to suffer from almost preternatural sensitivity. While a person who lost both legs in the July 7 bombings may hobble away quite gratefully with around &pound;50,000 per leg from the Criminal Injuries Board, the agony of being Bright - with accumulated snubs to the value of &pound;11m - cannot be so easily assuaged. So much so, that one worries. Would it, perhaps, be responsible if newspapers ceased to advertise this kind of gargantuan compensation claim, since it can have minimal bearing on settlements in the real world, and must surely, for the still-traumatised City victims and their lawyers, be the cause of further, unendurable pain?<b>Can no one protect our schools from the</b> forces of darkness? An advertisement in last week's Guardian reassures us that within just a few years, the education secretary's statutory powers should be substantially bolstered in this respect by the power of the Lord Jesus. Seeking an ""accomplished fundraiser"", we find this newspaper's former Diary Vicar, the Rev Steve Chalke.The charity, Oasis UK - says the advertisement - ""requires an experienced and enthusiastic individual to work alongside the Founder, Steve Chalke, to raise the required funds to realise Oasis' vision"". And what is that vision? It is ""to create outstanding schools and vibrant community hubs. Our motivation is rooted in the core beliefs and values of the Christian faith ... "" The successful applicant, it specifies, ""Owns Oasis' ethos"", as well as having a ""proven track record of fundraising primarily from HVDs, corporate and business sectors"". HVD? A piece of religious jargon, meaning high value dealer. There is no need, you gather, for the fundraiser to know anything about schools; this, presumably being the job of the Rev Steve Chalke. Not that he, from what one can tell, has any experience of running schools either.No matter: our children's education depends, the government has decided, on the involvement of amateurs - whether they be homophobic religious fanatics, self-promoting tradesmen, would-be barons, parents or classroom assistants - guaranteed to have no experience in schools. Their aim, like that of the prime minister's old speechwriter, Peter Hyman, when he arrived at Islington Green, may be no more complicated than to ""do something different"". Or in the Rev Steve Chalke's case, to live the values of the Christian faith. Or in Reg Vardy's, to promulgate the efficacy of a flood, as a sovereign remedy for sin.Will our children's minds be safe in their hands? Who, after the past few days, can doubt it?<b>This week</b> Catherine read extracts from Naomi Wolf's latest, The Treehouse; about what her dad thinks: ""Reminded me to get hold of Little House in the Big Woods - more lessons in life and cabin construction from Pa, better told.""

0,"To march or not to march? It would be good exercise, of course, exhilarating with it. As Doris Lessing once remarked, recalling her five Aldermaston outings, ""It seems to go against the grain of leftwing pieties to say that few things are more enjoyable than marching, picketing, striking, rioting; to be part of a large crowd high on singing, chanting, slogans. To be, by definition, with the forces of good against evil. No wonder it is so popular. But is it always, or even often, effective?"" Well, the Aldermaston marches weren't. Nor, more recently, was the Countryside Alliance's demonstration, the biggest ever, of more than 400,000 people. The presence of so many disparate, sometimes conflicting, interest groups, which added so much to its size, also robbed it of any clarity. What could you make of a march that features slogans from ramblers as well as pleas for cheaper fuel?  With ""Not In My Name"", anti-war organisers seem to have found something that is not merely catchy, but suggestive of some sort of solidarity, the line featured, in the past few days, on the banners of individual lobbyists at Westminster as well as on the front page of the Daily Mirror, which has appropriated the slogan for complaint forms that, once signed, will be forwarded en masse, to Tony Blair.  Actually, the wording makes it rather easy for him to answer, doesn't it? ""It's not in your name, you conceited twerp. It's in the whole country's"". In fact, if disassociation rather than outright disapproval of the war is their motive, his critics probably ought to write directly to Saddam Hussein, making it clear that whatever missiles might shortly be coming his way, they most certainly do not hail from the blameless environs of No 10 Acacia Avenue.  Compared to the anti-war slogans of the past, NIMN sends out a piqued, self-regarding sort of message that seems more suited to use by picky consumers who define themselves, say, by their disapproval of GM foods, or boycotting of Starbucks rather than by a mass movement aiming to change the views of a legitimate government in whose actions everyone, assuming they have a vote, is implicated whether they like it or not. ""Not in My Name"" is just a more fatuously self-important version of ""I'm against it"". So what? Loads of us are against it. We've all got names.  Still, putting feelings before arguments is one way of uniting the unpersuaded with the fanatics, of snuggling the views of Major General Cordingley alongside those of George Galloway, Tony Benn and all the other speakers whose presence on an anti-war platform make marching such an ordeal for the unpractised protester. I may be against the war, but I'm also against George Galloway. Quite possibly, being harangued by Galloway, the doting recipient of Saddam's Quality Street, is too high a price to pay for the thrill of direct action.   Unless, as believers in marching must hope, the activity is not just an irrelevant ""not in my name"" opportunity to show off, and Blair really is listening. Or counting. Maybe there is a magic number. How many of us on the streets would it take to change his tactics, or sharpen up his arguments? More than 400,000, we must assume, since that failed to change one single government policy on the countryside. Half a million? A million? Two? But for a such a very modern prime minister as Blair, all this galumphing up and down may well be a bit last century. Will a march tell him anything an opinion poll or focus group cannot? Not, I think, if its most prominently displayed message is Not In My Name, the Baby on Board of political slogans.  <B>Abu Hamza: what's with the hook?</B>With his many acolytes and arduous round of spiritual duties, the Muslim cleric Abu Hamza can surely be forgiven if he does not always have time to make the best of himself. On the other hand - and I say this not in a remotely critical way (for Hamza turns out to be a valued friend of my colleague, Rod Liddle), but in a spirit of Trinny-and-Susannah-like altruism - would it not be in Hamza's own interests if he worked just a tiny bit harder to frustrate those who enjoy portraying him as the fanatical embodiment of all evil? Could he not, at least, lose the hook? We know that Hamza had the misfortune when abroad, in circumstances that are not entirely clear, to be parted from at least one of his hands. In the short-term, a stout claw must have seemed a nifty and economical substitute. But years later, it is this very hook that enables his tabloid critics to play, continually, on his supposed similarity to Captain Hook, the murderous villain from Peter Pan. It is as if, John Major, for convenience's sake, had actually painted himself grey; or if Cedric Brown had gone about in a set of whiskers, miaowing.  And it is so unnecessary. As we know from Mrs Paul McCartney, who likes to take hers off on television, the modern prosthesis can be a wonderful and lifelike thing. And even if the NHS is unable to supply, free at the point of delivery, the sort of costly, custom-made limb that McCartney is apt to flourish, it can no doubt be relied upon, after Hamza's long residence in this country, to come up with something a bit more appealing, not to mention less sharp, than a hook.  Indeed, if Hamza does not stop waving his claw about, there are sure to be unjust suspicions that he is doing it to annoy. As JM Barrie writes of Captain James Hook, a man so wicked that he has a special contraption for smoking two cigars at once, ""undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw"". But Hamza is probably a stranger to The Adventures of Peter Pan, and will be dismayed to hear that his treasured hook is not a perfectly innocuous choice of hand-substitute. If he cannot persuade either the NHS or McCartney's landmine charity to supply a less threatening-looking replacement I am sure Guardian readers would be happy to help. To avoid confusion in any future police raids, any donation sent to the Finsbury Park mosque should be clearly labelled Give Hamza a Hand. <B>The crime of nostalgia</B>While some Londoners marvel at Ken Livingstone's nostalgia for the era before the invention of sexual intercourse, with its mumps, corporal punishment and thousands of six-year-old  commuters, the mayor would no doubt find passionate support for his views from Tony Martin, the farmer currently serving five years for shooting a burglar.  Only last week Martin was denied parole: partly because he is not remorseful enough; partly, as a shocked probation officer reported, because he ""has strong opinions about how 'England'   should be and makes references to how wonderful society was in the 50s"". Although the viewing of the past through rose-tinted spectacles is not - yet - illegal behaviour, Livingstone's  constituents may, none the less, wonder if they wish to be represented by a man whose opinions, were he a convict, may be punishable by an extra year in prison. Only a very strong,  compensatory show of remorse for the criminally poor quality of his leadership may be enough to convince us that Livingstone does not constitute a very present danger to society."
0,"It is curious that the one appealing thing about Ken Clarke - his enormously advanced age - should be perceived as a weakness. There are, of course, a hundred anti- age-discrimination reasons, too worthy to list here, to applaud the promotion, at his third attempt, of a man who has reached the official age of retirement. But it is the return from holiday of Tony Blair, still in the grip of what seems to be one of the longest and most florid mid-life crises in modern history, that now shows Clarke's seniority in such an appealing light.On a superficial level, there is the guarantee that Clarke will never appear in T-shirts with a Burberry trim, in thick makeup, or having recently been made over by a fitness expert. Neither he nor his wife will advertise their prodigious sexual energy. He will not have to waste eight hours a week in the gym strengthening the muscles that will be seen when he deliberately takes his shirt off in public, or risk his heart murmur playing tennis, or dive off boats, or do any of the other things that people aged around 25 do in advertisements for cars.More importantly, we will be spared, with Clarke, the middle-aged man's horror of the old, and his consuming, rather pitiful need to identify himself incessantly with youth and novelty, in everything from pop music to technology to millennia. Above all, the wonderful ancientness of Clarke ensures that when he goes, he goes. With Blair, who is still distracted by the business of middle age, there is one certainty: like Clinton, he will never fully leave us alone. We will be at his side as he allows himself to go grey, exchanges tennis for golf, and makes his first, hesitant experiment with Viagra. After eight years of Blair, the only possible objection to Clarke is that he would be an even safer bet at 70.<b>The milk of human self-interest</b>The celebrity gynaecologist, Professor Lord Robert Winston, is a very clever man. He has created thousands of babies. He is always on telly. He is a peer of the type whose illimitable wisdom supplies champions of the unreformed Lords with their last remotely persuasive argument for not electing its members. Professor Lord Robert Winston, in fact, is so brainy that, were he to tell you to do something, you'd be a fool not to do it. This week, large newspaper advertisements have featured the Labour peer posing in the guise of an enlightened milkman with a litre bottle of full-fat in his hands, over a caption which trumpets the health benefits of St Ivel's Omega 3- enriched Advance: ""It's clever milk.""Why add fish oil to milk? Let us consult Professor Lord Robert Winston, or at least his new St Ivel's press release. ""Children of today do not have enough Omega 3 in their diet,"" he explains. ""The largest source of this nutrient is oily fish and, as many mums have found, this food is not popular with children. What has been lacking is an easier way for families to get more Omega 3 in a more user-friendly format.""According to Dairy Crest (the company to which many mums are already indebted for its Homer Simpson Raspberry ""Doh""-Nut-flavoured milk), ""Anecdotal evidence from teachers and parents indicates that increasing intake of Omega 3 may improve learning and concentration for some children."" Anecdotal evidence is the kind of evidence not considered adequate by the government's National Institute for Clinical Excellence. And ""some children""? How many would that be? Neither Dairy Crest nor Lord Winston elaborates, in this press release anyway, on which children might belong to this category. That may be because they are referring to the children with behavioural or learning disorders such as dyspraxia or dyslexia who are, as yet, the only ones who have been shown - anecdotally - to benefit from supplements of Omega 3.In a Durham study featured in the 2004 BBC programme, A Child of Our Time, for example, which was presented by Winston, all the children were selected because they were not fulfilling their potential. There is, then, no body of evidence which I am aware of that drinking St Ivel's Advance will make a normal child ""clever"". Or even enhance its ""concentration and learning"". Even if the evidence were there, there are, of course, many ways of consuming adequate quantities of Omega 3, from eating a balanced diet to buying rival Omega 3-enriched brands, such as supplemented orange juice or eggs.Still, a few additional glasses of Omega 3-enriched milk are unlikely to do any harm to a child of average build on a balanced diet. It is surely the wellbeing of Professor Lord Robert Winston that we should be concerned about. While I can find nothing in the code of conduct for peers that actually prohibits a sideline as a milkman, there must be the possibility that next time Lord Winston rises to his feet to say something wise about science, his audience will struggle to blot out the image of him caressing the lid of his St Ivel's milk bottle and thus have difficulty in following what Lord Winston has previously described as ""the quiet and mature arguments so frequent during ministerial questions in the Lords"".Some may even see a potential conflict between the peer's promotion of St Ivel's Advance and the injunction, in the Lords code of conduct, to remember the principle of (a), Selflessness: ""Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends."" And the principle of (b), Integrity: ""Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.""The code also asks holders of public office to remember that they ""are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office"". No doubt Lord Winston will, at some point, explain why he chose to throw his clinical weight behind St Ivel's Advance, and reassure the distributors of stupid milk that he has nothing against their non-Omega 3-enhanced product.In a chamber that still contains the convicted perjurer Jeffrey Archer, Tony Blair's flatmate Lord Falconer, and any number of disreputable, dim and unworthy beneficiaries of political patronage, we should not, I know, get disproportionately worked up about Winston's new sideline. Perhaps we should even be thankful that he did not decide to endorse Simpsons doughnut-flavoured milk (""bought by parents who want to smuggle milk and calcium into their children's diet"",) or Utterly Butterly (""appeals to people who don't take life too seriously""). In an upper chamber where millionaire donors do so well, the pressure to behave in a nakedly self-interested way must be intense.Whatever the thinking behind his celebrity endorsement, Winston's obvious indifference to its more unappealing aspect only adds to the evidence - admittedly anecdotal - that Blair's placeman-enriched, clever Lords, with enhanced powers of concentration, is turning out to be as insufferably self-serving as the old, half-witted version. Now that they are gone, you realise that the one thing to be said for men such as Lord Longford, the late and unlamented Marquess of Bath and Lord Clancarty, who used to believe in flying saucers, is that their imprimatur on a bottle of milk, had it ever come to pass, would have been its kiss of death. Many mums like that in a peer."
0,"Why did Talk magazine fold? Need you ask? The finger points squarely at al-Qaida. ""We all had to realise that 9/11 changed everything,"" said Talk Media's president, Ron Galotti. Tina Brown, the magazine's former editor, put it more lyrically. ""There's one odd you can't fight against and that's something that comes out of the sky. That is the only reason I'm not howling and bawling more."" Many of that rising number of people, or businesses, who can only attribute their problems to the irruption of 9/11 make a similar show of restraint. To protest too much would be to equate their problems with the true, harrowing human tragedy of that day. Which would be in unforgivably poor taste. So they simply, undemonstratively let it be known that, though they are not making too much fuss about it, they, too, are victims. It's only because they are not actually dead that they are not howling and bawling more. But that doesn't mean that the agonies of what would otherwise be perfectly healthy magazines and restaurants, clothes shops and long-running musicals cannot, also, be inflicted without warning by something out of the sky.  At Photo-Me International, sales have dropped by a third. Last week, its chairman blamed    September 11, after which, he said, people were no longer in the mood to take ""fun snaps"" in photo-booths. To be sure, the company had also lost a contract from the Post Office and there had been changes to the Japanese driving-licence system, as well as a general economic downturn - the one that started before September 11. But the main reason for his company's difficulties came, like Talk magazine's, out of the sky. Curiously, the chastening influence of Osama does not seem to have inhibited the taking of fun snaps at home, for pre-Christmas photography sales were healthy, but that is another of the strange things about the business impact of September 11 - its victims are chosen seemingly at random.  Is there any reason, for example, why Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats should now collapse, its audiences supposedly depleted by the 9/11 impact on tourism, while rival West End shows such as Kiss Me Kate or the Lion King prosper? Why did people, post-September 11, still want to eat at branches of Cafe Rouge, but not at Planet Hollywood, which went into bankrupcy protection for the second time last October, this time with the novel excuse that terrorism had done for its burgers? Why was Matalan, the discount clothes store, excluded for no other discernible reason from the pre-Christmas spending boom that benefited many of its rivals, including Marks and Spencer, Next, Debenham's and Asda? Ian Smith, Matalan's finance director, maintained that 9/ll had presented the ""most significant"" challenge to its profits. ""You'd be surprised,"" he said recently. ""There has been a lot of comfort spending on luxury goods and something has got to give.""  It's true, as Smith says, that sales of upmarket fun - jewellery and champagne, watches and perfume - have recently flourished, despite the gloom that afflicted former clients of Photo-Me. But even in the luxury-goods market, there are claims of victimhood. Gucci has complained of a post-terrorism slump, ditto Mulberry, which now attributes a recent profits warning to the same cause. A doleful 9/11 report from the French luxury goods business, LVMH, has coincided with surveys reporting the best Christmas sales for 15 years and surges in consumer confidence, in both America and the UK. In the aftermath of a terrorist massacre, it appears, high-spending yet comfort-seeking consumers become intensely selective in their choice of scent and bags, holidays and silk underwear. Either that, or floundering companies will make any excuse for incompetence, however nauseating.  The death of Diana, Princess of Wales once led to a similar profusion of shameless buck-passing. People were too traumatised to shop. Too gutted to work. Too pooped to listen to the radio. Today, the ""tragic events"" excuses, though less convincing by the week, show no sign of abating. The attacks have recently been held responsible not only for business doldrums and a cascade of - often unrelated, but long-desired - redundancies, but for the rise in London street crime, the crisis in Mariah Carey's career; even the resignation of Madonna's agent. It's only a matter of time before we hear that 9/ll is responsible for the dreadful trains, the vomiting bug, and the filthy weather. When we all know that's entirely the fault of foot and mouth. <BR><B>Does Tina have the write stuff?</B><BR>No sooner had Tina Brown been liberated from Talk than her diaries were being described as ""the most coveted commodity among America's publishers"". She could, it was said, ""write her own cheque"". A diary fragment, recently published in Talk, describing an encounter with Iris Murdoch and John Bayley, was taken to offer a ""tantalising glimpse"" of the kind of biting yet insightful quality the purchaser might get for his or her zillions. Before they invite her to think of a number, though, publishers might like to see a more substantial example of Ms Brown's written work: Life as a Party, a collection of enthusiastic pieces about celebrities and the upper classes written when she edited Tatler. Examining swank estate agents, the critical eye that discerned everything from egg-stains to sexual impulses at her meeting with the Bayleys, saw only well-connected young men: ""In Knight Frank's Hanover Square headquarters,"" ran a typical paragraph, ""the social magnet is Christopher Chetwode, brother of the present baron. His mother is a Berry and 20 of his cousins are millionaires. The Sloane Street branch has Lady Rose Nevill, daughter of Lord Abergavenny, and Richard Ford, the son of the Queen's ex-assistant private secretary; while at the Ascot office country residential keeps its end up with the Earl of Shrewsbury's 25-year-old brother, Paul Chetwynd-Talbot.""  Even if a certain level of indulgence was only politic from the editor of Tatler, this book suggests that, 20 years ago, the rich and grand had strikingly little to fear from Brown. Remove the sporadic pertnesses and bon-mots from the pages of Life as a Party, and you are left with a diligent collection of of party-lists, family trees and exhaustive inventories of real estate that owes more to Nigel Dempster than Tom Wolfe.  While some of her English contemporaries stood back a little, the better to observe the tribal rituals of Sloane Rangers, Brown seemed, in the early 80s, to prefer the traditional, prostrate perspective of Jennifer's Diary. ""Although the Binnings live at Mellerstain,"" she writes, on a tour of Scottish stateleys, ""the family seat is Tyninghame, a red, turreted, Gothic mansion overlooking the sea on the west coast of Scotland. Lord Binning's parents, the Earl (now 85) and Countess of Haddington have lived here since 1952, returning to Mellerstain in the winter to hunt. The whole family moves to Mellerstain at Christmas when the main house is opened up for 10 days. ""It's wonderful to see wellies and coats outside rooms which spend the year looking perfect, says Prue...""  If, as such pieces suggest, the Brown diaries do not turn out to be the longed-for treasure-trove of scabrous indiscretion, they will, at least, provide an infallible guide to who, in the last quarter of a century, has been considered smart - or ""hot"" - and who has not. A trivial subject, perhaps, but one on which Tina Brown has contrived to build a long and scintillating career."
0,"Whatever happened to the Big Conversation? A chill in the air reminds one that it is now a year since Mr Blair launched what he said would be an honest, ""grown-up discussion"" in which the whole country could participate. ""Big issues need a real debate, a big conversation between politicans and the people."" There would be meetings, for those who like meetings, and for everyone else, a website, which was launched with a selection of carefully composed tributes from radiantly satisifed Labour supporters. Before long, the Big Conversation had become, more entertainingly, a home from home for the grumpy and resentful: ""I can see myself living the last years of my life in poverty,"" wrote one, not untypical respondent, ""the quality of life here is on a steep decline."" Others offered detailed calculations to prove that their lives had become a financial catastrophe. From what was published, it seemed most respondents wanted to complain about council tax, inadequate benefits, over-lavish benefits, house prices, speeding cars, speed restrictions, the railways, the bus services, local councils, pathetic pensions, terrible house prices, awful facilities for the disabled, bullying at work, smoking, the evils of outsourcing and the closure of local facilities. I could not, however, find anyone demanding the creation of super-casinos for the democratisation of gambling. Or expressing any interest in smacking.  Overall, the tone - and this relates, of course, only to the messages selected for publication - would probably be familiar to anyone working in a call centre, where staff are trained to respond with an unbroken, impartial silence, followed, in the end, by a bland, ""What would you like me to do?""  In the case of the Big Conversation, that silence continues. There has been, as yet, no formal acknowledgement of the public's anguished postings. No analysis or summary of their views has been published; not so much as a thank-you has emerged from Mr Blair. It has been, then, a rather funny sort of conversation. Just as Britain was, for a while, a rather funny sort of GB: PLC. Of course, as any survivor of the talking cure will tell you, there's nothing wrong with a conversation in which only one side contributes. It's good just to get it off your chest. But even in the world of therapy I believe it is rare for these one-sided encounters to go on for as long as a year.  A party spokesman says that the public's responses were fed into Labour's national policy forum. So this will be one of those debates in which the reply comes in the shape of a printed party manifesto. Will it feature baffles on street lights? Or a ban on membership of the Freemasons? Or the reform of council tax? Or the renationalisaton of the railways?  The spokesman mentions the strength of public feeling on smoking, childcare and antisocial behaviour. He says the Conversation ""achieved what it set out to do"". In other words, having created what amounts to a giant virtual dustbin and filled it with complaints familiar from every MP's surgery in the land (minus the hopeless and illiterate, but swollen by comments from constituents with net access), the Labour party has moved on.  As the election nears, ministers will no doubt cite comments made by other Big Conversationalists when it suits. But without any analysis of the submissions of its self-selecting contributors, it is impossible to know whether Labour policy reflects consensus on the website, defies it, or, indeed, whether it should have taken any notice at all of this diligently censored PR exercise.  When the website opened, Labour officials claimed that nothing would be ""off limits"". ""Tell us your No 1 priority for Britain,"" they urged. (After all, there was nothing forcing them to publish it.) In the past year there must have been a few of the 15,000 contributors to the website who thought that the No 1 priority for Britain - after local buses, anyway - was resolution of the war in Iraq. But in the world of the Big Conversation (which our Labour spokesman still describes as ""a debate without prejudice""), this subject never came up. Perhaps it never happened. Our priorities are childcare, smoking, and antisocial behaviour. The Big Conversation's work is done.   <B>Poor, 'bereaved' Paula</B><B>"
0,"With his first column for this paper, my new colleague, Osama bin Laden, reminds us how rarely today's commentators attempt to take the long view. Leaving aside our regular references to the emperor who made his horse a consul, and the occasional, hazy deployment of Walter Bagehot, most journalists clearly feel that too much dwelling on the past will sound either schoolmasterish, or show-offy, or both at the same time.  No such scruples beset Mr Bin Laden, who this week compared Arab rulers who cooperate with the Americans with ""our forefathers, the Ghassanids"". Perhaps sensing that parts of his audience may not be au fait with these forefathers - whom I now understand to have been an ancient, pre-Islamic tribe living in what are today's Jordan and southern Syria - he supplied the following gloss: ""Their leaders' concern was to be appointed kings and officers for the Romans in order to safeguard the interests of the Romans by killing their brothers, the peninsula's Arabs. Such is the case of the new Ghassanids, the Arab rulers. Muslims, if you do not punish them for their sins in Jerusalem and Iraq, they will defeat you. They will also rob you of the land of the two holy places.""   Did the early Ghassanid collaborators do so much damage? Wouldn't we have heard about it? Even at this distance? A rudimentary search confirms that the Ghassanids were, as Bin Laden states, successful and accomplished vassals of the sixth-century Byzantines. In the Oxford History of Byzantium, Robert Hoyland quotes a Ghassanid poet addressing his master: ""Do you not see that God has granted you such a degree of power that you will observe every king trembling at your feet; for you are the sun, the kings are stars, and when the sun rises, no star will be seen."" Less than a century afterwards the Ghassanids had been crushed in battle and absorbed into the rapidly expanding Islamic empire. Indeed, from this admittedly unscholarly perspective, it is hard to see how the defeat of the Ghassanid collaborators could be anything other than a reassuring precedent for the jihad-minded Bin Laden reader.  Still, whatever the lesson of the Ghassanids, Bin Laden's latest references to ancient history confirm comments made by Bernard Lewis, in his enlightening and lucid The Crisis of Islam. ""In current American usage,"" he says, ""the phrase 'That's history' is commmonly used to dismiss something as unimportant ... The Muslim peoples, like everyone else in the world, are shaped by their history, but unlike some others, they are keenly aware of it."" It is hard, he adds, ""to imagine purveyors of mass propaganda in the west making their points by allusions dating from the same period, to the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy in England or the Carolingian monarchs in France"". And even if our politicians did go in for more historical allusions, alluding to the past is not the same as trying to enforce it.  If there is no point in arguing with Bin Laden's implacable call to arms, there is every reason to try to comprehend his appeal to his followers. Which requires some acquaintance with history. Which, as we know, is not compulsory in the national curriculum for children over 14: precisely the age, some teachers point out, that they begin to understand it."
0,"After a number of recent battles, in which quite a few hundred people have been slaughtered, the sensitive politician might want to avoid the use of bellicose imagery. At least, until the real war in Iraq is over. Tony Blair, on the other hand, can think of no better way with which to emphasise the violence of his latest volte-face. Such is his disgust for the word ""referendum"", with its connotations of weedy debates and passive consultation (not to mention innocuous ""tidying up""), that he prefers to present it as a rough, tough, gloves-off fight until the best man wins. ""Let the issue be put. Let battle be joined."" If this seems a repellently stupid, and, in the circumstances, staggeringly tasteless choice of words, we should perhaps consider whether Blair, the born-again warrior, is able to control himself. In Plan of Attack, his illuminating and persuasive new account of the approach to the Iraq war, Bob Woodward reminds us how George Bush flattered our prime minister, after the latter had pledged British troops, telling Alastair Campbell: ""Your man has got cojones."" Afterwards, Bush would call this the ""the cojones meeting"". More recently, in an interview with Woodward, the president apparently recalled: ""And, of course, these Brits don't know what cojones are.""  Assuming Bush was referring to our linguistic limitations rather than to some flaw in the national biology, he is, of course, quite wrong. We have read Ernest Hemingway. Cojones is the Spanish word for testicles. Moreover, the heavily cojoned hero of Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is taken for a Scot. In attributing cojones to Blair, Bush is saying that our prime minister, for all that he may resemble a not particularly vigorous 50-year-old who likes looking at beach volleyball players, is actually a heroic kind of person, a man who might easily have volunteered for the Spanish civil war, or fought bulls in the ring, or enjoyed any number of the life-threatening sports Hemingway considered truly virile: ""It takes more cojones to be a sportsman where death is a closer party to the game"" (Death in the Afternoon, 1932).  Not the least alarming revelation, in Woodward's account of Bush's covert preparations for war, is the strutting, sparring manner in which his jowly advisers would urge one another on to walk the walk. Donald Rumsfeld advocated moments when you have to ""look people in the eye"". Bush duly ""looked Blair in the eye"". (Not to be outdone, Blair looked ""Bush back in the eye"".) Karl Rove, working on Bush's image, lists among desired presidential qualities, ""Strong Leader, Bold Action, Big Ideas, Peace in World"". Although it's not always as dignified as that.  At a crucial meeting in December 2002, in which he attempted to convince Bush that the evidence for WMD was compelling, George Tenet, the CIA director, threw his arms up in the air and twice declared, ""It's a slam dunk case!"" (I understand, in the absence of Woodward's guidance, that this is a forceful and decisive basketball shot, meaning, when used by the head of the CIA, that there is no question that the WMD evidence is adequate.)  Aside from its flattering new cover depicting the pardners Bush and Blair - in contrast to the all-American line-up on the US jacket - the British edition of Plan of Attack depicts this country's engagement in Bush's war as little more than a tactical requirement. In early attack plans, drawn up by General Franks in December 2001, British involvement was presented as optional. Later, of course, it was thanks to Blair that the US went through the motions of seeking UN endorsement for its war, but only because Bush needed Blair to stay in office, where he could proclaim loyalty and support. ""If his government went down, Bush would not only lose his chief ally but it would strengthen Saddam. Imagine the headlines! Plus, Bush reasoned, he would be blamed. It would be a double whammy.""  So worried was Bush about the PR disaster of being forced, in the absence of Blair, into the unilateral, ""imperial option"", that he called him, offering to find another role for British forces, an opt-out as ""peacekeepers or something. I would rather go alone than have your government fall."" Blair, the  buen hombre, is recorded as replying: ""I said I'm with you. I mean it.""  If Bush and Woodward's account of these leader-to-leader conversations can be trusted, Blair was not so much the president's poodle, as his little drummer boy, free with declarations of eternal fealty - ""I said, I'm with you"" - for which he would be rewarded with compliments of the cojones variety, or other forms of presidential indulgence. But for all that Bush needed him, the relationship remained unequal. Demeaningly so. When it came to a second resolution, Blair had to plead with Bush: ""Blair said he needed the favour. Please."" It was graciously granted. After Blair's successful war speech in the commons, Bush is supposed to have called him, and rhapsodised   ""leaders"" - like themselves - ""who take strong stands and define their missions"".  Exactly how much of this sub-Hemingway posturing actually occurred between the two men, neither of whom has ever been in combat, it is hard to say. Some of it is so shaming that, if untrue, Blair should make haste to deny it. A few, utterly implausible expressions, such as ""whip counters"" and wanting to ""win strong"", suggest we should not believe every word. But the cross-my-heart avowals are all too convincing. And Campbell's earlier reports of the dumb, virile fun of war summits (where he, too, got recognised as a man), make it easy to believe now in Woodward's extended account of the eyeballing and bonding and slam dunking which seem to have constituted, for Bush and his allies, an updated version of coating themselves in woad.  Today, although slighted by the blood brother who persuaded him to commit 45,000 British troops to war, Blair still appears to cherish his status as a man whose cojones are so surpassingly huge that he can do no wrong. It takes balls to walk all over the cabinet. It takes balls to contradict yourself like this. It takes balls to fly to Bermuda when there's a war on. Maybe he should go off and edit Nuts magazine. <B>Lies, damn lies and EU myths</B>One reason for a referendum, according to the prime minister, is to expose the disgraceful ""nonsense-myths"" circulated by eurosceptics. Among other fictions, he itemised ""being forced to drive on the right, the Germans taking over our nuclear weapons; and, no doubt, the shape of our bananas, too."" Some of us would have been still more reassured if, in this list of appalling slurs and malicious inventions, Blair had confirmed that a draft EU directive on gender equality will not, if it is adopted, result in a massive rise in the cost of women's car insurance. For the idea that young women, who drive more safely than young men, should have to pay the same as the sex that accounts for 98% of dangerous driving, is surely quite as absurd as the regulation of banana dimensions.  But when one remembers the mischievous propagandists who are keen to damage the EU at any cost, it becomes obvious that they, and not a social affairs commissioner called Anna Diamantopoulou, must be responsible. For if adopted, her proposal must be a precedent for the introduction of strict, anti-discriminatory regulation in every other area of insurance, with non-smokers stumping up the same premiums as smokers, croquet players paying as much as skiers.  Next time we hear from the improbable ""Anna Diamantopoulou"", let us remember Blair's assurances, and resolve not to believe everything we read in the newspapers."
0,"As well as a very encouraging article about sex over 60, the forthcoming issue of Saga magazine features an admiring interview with its cover-boy, Michael Howard. ""The recent career of Michael Howard is an example to us all,"" begins the writer, Martin Vander Weyer. And not only, he explains to Saga readers, to people beginning ""to weigh up the pros and cons of easing toward retirement"". It is the ""re-emergence"" of Michael Howard, he says, that should inspire ""anyone who has ever felt that the best is past and the odds are impossibly stacked against a revival of fortune"".  Not to mention anyone who has just lost two byelections, seen their accent ridiculed, and now suspects their former supporters may be dropping away. Mr Howard may well, in these new circumstances, be feeling that the best part of his leadership is behind him. He will have noticed that, with Lord Tebbit out mischief-making while Mr Blair celebrates his 10 glorious years, the odds are impossibly stacked against a revival of fortune. That is not to say he can no longer make a useful contribution. Maybe he could clean behind the fridge while the lovely and still sought-after Sandra is out on her modelling assignments.  Nor is this message of hope springing eternal the only lesson to be drawn from the Saga piece. There is a lesson here for journalists, too. Given the built-in obsolescence of modern Tory leaders, it would probably be as well for anyone interviewing one, and working with a lead time of more than a week, to assume that by the time the article is published that leader will have been pitilessly evicted. Or, at any rate, challenged. Or at the very least, transformed, overnight, from party saviour, to embarrassing loser.  Yesterday, after witnessing Howard's dismal performance in the post-Butler debate, the Daily Mail's sketchwriter, Quentin Letts, lamented the way Howard had ""shrivelled like a punctured birthday balloon"" when confronted with an uppish Blair and an unusually hyper-active audience. ""Mr Howard was thrown by this mob. His speech yesterday was a disaster.""  Even taking into account the sensation - no doubt familiar to fellow Saga readers - of time accelerating with the advancing years, it seems only yesterday that this same Quentin Letts was celebrating this same Tory leader's prowess at the dispatch box. In fact, it turns out to be a full eight months since he described the first Howard-Blair parliamentary bout as ""better and bloodier than Giant Haystacks versus Big Daddy ... It was impossible to be in that chamber and not feel a surge of excitement that an element of parity has been restored."" He was not the only one to applaud the arrival of Mr Howard, the party's third deliverer in six years. In the Independent, Bruce Anderson dismissed the ""myxie rabbit"" as he tastefully called Iain Duncan Smith, and hailed his replacement's ""incisive, forensic style of argument"". Simon Heffer also liked Mr Howard for being ""forensically minded"", and predicted that, on television, ""he will look relentless, even threatening.""  Alas, the forensic style seems to have gone out of fashion, and even as some of us suspected at the time of his election, being relentless, even threatening on television is not much use if you have no ideas to be relentless about, and still say ""pippel"". As for the famous, lawyerly ratiocination: it has had a perplexing, most unfortunate tendency to go missing whenever it was needed, which, with so many judicial whitewashes coming out nowadays, has been quite often. In short, like Hague and IDS, Howard has been a terrible mistake. After the byelections, Simon Heffer observed that all the Tories' energetic campaigning had ""achieved nothing. After a change of leader and various new policies, their whole strategy appears flawed.""  Who's next? The conservatives would seem to have a choice of some keen young fellows called Cameron and Osborne, of whom no one outside politics has ever heard, and some keen, slightly older men, both journalists, who are able and may thus be a bit scary to the cautious Conservative party member, who generally goes for something more sinister, comical, or bald. But with the new fashion for disposable leaders, perhaps it doesn't matter much. Any Tories dismayed to find that the latest model has already, irreparably broken down, should remember what the washing machine repair man always says: What do you expect? It's almost a year old, innit? 'Ardly worf mending. You want to go out and get a new one.  If William Hague managed four years, IDS two, and Howard is beset by mockery and despair after only eight months, it follows that his successor will barely have long enough to get his - or her! - teeth fixed, learn to say multiculturalism, and get themselves interviewed by Saga magazine before Lord Tebbit, or similar, starts oiling the wheels of the gurney. Like the modern washing machine, the new system is awfully wasteful and very poor value. Before long, the mountains of defunct Tory leaders could present a real environmental hazard. But that's progress for you.<B>Why the SWP likes a bit of discipline</B>This week's obituaries of Paul Foot have been a reminder of the British left's debt to the British public school system. So many leading opponents of privilege appear to have been shaped by early experiences in the house system that it seems probable the left can only suffer from recent attempts to replace traditional, character-building brutality with elements of human kindness. Still, the reintroduction of house points, uniforms and other Bunterish trimmings to the state system is promising; and the songs of Radiohead's Thom Yorke are proof that even a moderately strict public school, such as Abingdon, may engender lifelong mistrust of the establishment. Yorke's school seems to have suffered from nothing much worse than a bad case of rugby and a headmaster ""with ridiculous sideburns"", but the Radiohead boys are still warbling furiously about ""bastard headmaster/i'm not going back/children taught to kill/to tear themselves to bits/on playing fields"". Tessa Jowell has had much to say, recently, about the merits of competitive sport, and it is pleasant to think that the main beneficiaries of such discipline may not be her own party, but the SWP.<B>But who will be Alastair's friend?</B>Welcome though it is, as a contribution to harmonious race relations, I wonder if the Commission for Racial Equality's report on friendship goes far enough. The exercise of totting up black and Asian friends only emphasised the poverty of my friends collection, bereft, as it is, of any Welsh friends, friends on remand, estate agent friends, stockbroker friends, traveller friends, car mechanic friends, fat cat friends, sex industry friends, spin doctor friends and friends who are also baronets. To name just a few of the kinds of friends I have yet to meet. How, as Trevor Phillips has asked, can we avoid being misled by stereotypes, and avoid feelings of hostility, if we have no first-hand experience? With schoolchildren, one can imagine methods of enforcement. But how will adults find the time, or the opportunity to ingratiate themselves with unfamiliar people they have not been introduced to? Friendship leave, enforced in the same way as jury service?  A better solution - as so often these days - might be a lottery, in which each of us is randomly allocated 20 new friends. After which it remains only to build those close and lasting bonds from which Phillips' dream of a fully integrated Britain can evolve. Swapping and trading in friends will not be permitted. After all, someone, somewhere, is going to get Alastair Campbell."
0,"Have we all gone mad? Even madder, that is, than our leader, who is now widely considered to be at best ""rambling"" (Correlli Barnett), at worst, a ""plausible psychopath""  (Prospect, The New Statesman)? Even madder than Blair's enemy, the no less totally doolally Clare Short? Yet more raving bonkers than Blair's potential successor, the ""psychologically flawed"" Gordon  Brown (diagnosis, courtesy Dr A Campbell)? Still more barking than the ""disturbed and dangerous"" (Mail on Sunday) Campbell himself, who presides, according to one mental health professional, over a Downing Street ""on the verge of a classic trauma syndrome""?  We have. Difficult as it is to keep up with developments in the fastmoving world of amateur  psychiatry, there seems to be a general agreement that one of the very maddest things anyone could possibly do, during this period of intense disillusion with Blair, is conclude that it might be an idea to replace him with someone else. Rebuking dissidents for their silliness last weekend, the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley said it ""makes you wonder who most needs a session in the psychiatrist's chair"".  Supposing he is right and to go off Blair is to be insane, it is quite worrying, isn't it? Voter on couch: Doctor, doctor - I don't think I'd vote for Blair again. Am I going mad?"" Doctor: ""Yes."" If the prime minister were not himself a signatory to the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Changing Minds campaign, with its ambition to combat ""inaccurate representation, in the media and elsewhere, based on stigmatising attitudes and stereotypes ('nutter', 'psycho', 'schizo')..."", we might anticipate real problems in finding adequate beds and medication for the thousands of people who will not forgive Blair for making monkeys of them.  Even contented Blairites who concede that such disaffection need not, by itself, indicate progressive mental debility, are apt to dismiss any talk of replacing Blair as sheer folly. ""Why try to change the most successful leader in the Labour party's history?"", as David Blunkett put it recently. So often and so confidently does this claim trip off his supporters' tongues that one  tends to forget that Harold Wilson won four elections to Blair's two. And that if Blair has won bigger majorities, the latter was achieved after the smallest turnout since 1918. Moreover, if the ""most successful"" claim can, according to certain parameters, be justified, what does it actually mean? That Blair will therefore always be identified as successful, no matter how low his former supporters hold him in esteem? That he can never be held responsible for any subsequent  mistakes, however grievous, or for the capital he has failed to make from all this unprecedented success? That he can do no wrong?  If I understand Blunkett's defence of Blair, past political success is now taken to confer life-long  immunity from failure or competition. Because he ditched Clause 4 and secured a minimum  wage, Blair has earned the right to more reverential treatment than, say, Churchill enjoyed after winning the war, or Margaret Thatcher received from her colleagues, having also made her party  seemingly unassailable.  One recalls that even the achievements of Caesar were not enough to mollify Brutus and co;  rather as Suetonius put it, ""his other actions and words so turn the scale, that it is thought that he abused his power and was justly slain.""  Given that Blair's critics are only discussing replacing him one day, rather than stabbing him to death in the capitol, it is hard to understand the pre-emptively Mark Antony-ish tone of his allies, with their accusations of lunacy: ""O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason... ""  Would Blair be so heroic a loss? Would we, after he had gone, find ourselves pining for his  dashing band of cronies, or wishing his successor could also go round bestriding the narrow world like a Colossus, or yearning for a figure who cared for us so much that his voice often cracked with emotion? Perhaps we would. The more one attempts to understand why, no  matter how much Blair might disappoint, the prospect of his departure from the political scene  should be so unbearable, the more this fear of losing him seems an unwholesome but not altogether surprising response to his own cult  of personality. Urged, repeatedly, to believe in Blair's self-belief and dedication, we have dutifully put our faith in him. Although doubters  cannot, in the absence of much political theory beyond ""what works"", be called heretics, they can be made to feel like traitors, Judases and ingrates.  What would we be without him? Maybe, just as children are meant to heed Hilaire Belloc's admonition  - ""And always keep a-hold of Nurse, for fear of finding something worse"" - we are simply anxious about being  led by someone who is not Blair, the saviour of his party. My own  solution, when either sentimentality or fear of the unknown strikes in this way, is to remember how smartly Blair has evicted individuals, from Peter Mandelson to Derry Irvine, the penultimate lord chancellor, in whom he himself has been disappointed.  Without a doubt, whoever finally succeeds Blair will be more boring. He, or she, could hardly cut so handsome a figure, be so proficient at acting or believe, so sincerely, in a semi-spiritual mission to reforge the nation's destiny (exact details TBC).

7,"At his new monthly press conferences, Tony Blair turns out a fine tour de force. He lays himself open to all questions, from footling local crime to great global issues. He looks unafraid, his manner warm and convincing. With elegant deftness he turns aside questions he does not want to answer. He plays off the hopeless vanity of the big cheeses among the lobby who vaunt their own questions instead of following up one after another to hammer home a previous point and dig deeper. He is master of this medium, knowing that one man exposed to a pack of hounds in public will always have the PR advantage. It is the fidgety press, not he, who winds up proceedings, bored after an hour or so, while he professes himself willing to stay and chat indefinitely. ""Doesn't he do it well!"" the journos say to one another between gritted teeth as they file out, feeling somehow cheated.  This week's press conference was billed as the one where the butterfly would wriggle on the pin. The cabinet is against war, the party does not want it and only 53% of the public would support it even if there is full UN approval on a second resolution. Yet the Blair butterfly flapped its wings and escaped again.  The effect doesn't last long. By the time the flotilla of hacks have reached the Downing Street gates, comparing notes as they go, they find there is nothing much there, another Chinese meal of a conference, hungry for more before they reach Whitehall. Then they realise the grounds for war have just shifted yet again. Last time it was because Saddam Hussein is a danger to his neighbours, has started four wars and must be stopped from launching a nuclear attack. But that line has worn thin: people see how containment works fairly well, with US bombing raids every week and no-fly enforcement. Dangerous materials may have slipped past sanctions - yet Iraq just does not look more threatening than North Korea. The real weapons of mass destruction are the hearts and minds of boys pouring out of madrassahs in our good friend Pakistan.  So now the Blair argument has shifted. This week the clear and present danger is not Saddam starting another war but the danger of his weapons sold to the madrassah boys. Blair is rightly frightened about terror to come, but the missing link in his argument is this: wouldn't an attack on Iraq make such terror more - not less - likely? Dangerous materials are already loose on the global market and war will inflame a terrorist rage which can only be assuaged eventually with peace and prosperity in the region.  There is no doubting the prime minister's sincerity: after all, his policy costs him more political pain than gain. Alas, that does not make him right and his moral rhetoric begins to sound naive in the real world where post-war Iraqi oil contracts are being bartered among UN security council members as the price and maybe the cause of war. His own attempt at peace in Palestine is crushed under the contemptuous White House boot. His passion on world poverty is ignored on the other side of the Atlantic. Maybe if he were in the White House, he might be a great world leader. But he isn't. He has only a weak British hand to play and the only question to ask is has he maximised British influence for global good, or could he have done better with it? As the prime advocate of a joint European defence policy, he threw away the chance to bring Europe together and reconnect its citizens with a sense of purpose in the union. His global visions once seemed admirable - but now sadly misplaced in the hands of George Bush. If only the scope of his foreign dreams were matched in ambition by his visions at home.   Perhaps that can change, for yesterday Tony Blair hosted a rather different event in Downing Street. It marked 10 years since the launch of Renewal, a magazine that sprung from the ruins of the 1992 election disaster. It was the thinking furnace to fire up ideas for New Labour modernisers. Tony Blair heads the list of its editorial advisory board and there collected was a room packed with many of New Labour's big brains - the advisers, the party apparat, heads of the thinktanks, cabinet brains, policy wonks, the brightest and best, (and many of those whey-faced young men who seem never to have left the artificial light of political seminar rooms). It was billed as a seminal event and so in a way it was, less for any actual ideas produced - (though there were plenty) - than for the fact that the prime minister himself recognised a need for them.  Ten years ago New Labour began to shape its manifesto so that it came to power with a well-planned programme which has been carried out. Devolution, abolition of the hereditaries, a minimum wage, the New Deal, a million jobs, virtually full employment, tax credits, much more social security for children, child benefit, cash for poor pensioners, and a bigger increase than the NHS and schools ever saw before. But that was done or foreshadowed in the first term.   Tony Blair promised a great leap forward in the second term, yet there has been dangerously little sign of new thinking. Delivery may be some time coming and even then expectations will run ahead, demanding more. Slowly nudging up statistics is not enough to sustain a government's momentum. So what now? A senior figure yesterday confessed, ""We're crap at politics,"" and that is an important admission. It was said in a slightly faux self-deprecatory way, implying they were far too busy delivering to worry about spin. But politics does matter. It is the vision thing, a beacon that explains what they are doing and why. It is what makes people believe in politics and politicians. It is where trust begins and respect for politics is engendered. Tony Blair's great political fault is his refusal to deliver a clarity of ideals. He avoids taking sides, giving nothing to his allies without taking with the other hand. He is always equivocal, so every time a public service is praised, praise for the private must follow.   The very word ""modernise"" which brought Renewal to birth is now a word damaged by daily abuse, a threat as often as a promise. Labour has evolved no new political vocabulary since then, a symptom of the lack of new political ideas for a political world changed out of recognition since 1993. This politics deficit is a curious phenomenon, for at heart Labour does not really lack ideals: it lacks the boldness to speak them out loud. The wish for social justice is there, but the vocabulary that might inspire others sticks in their throat.   This meeting signified that the prime minister sees the problem. After a few years in power, all leaders have a dangerous tendency to spend too much time on foreign policy - so much more intellectually challenging. Tony Blair enunciates his big ideas globally and perhaps too grandiosely. What he lacks is some big new ideas at home, for the clever plans devised for 1997 cannot sustain Labour through the next election. Time for renewal indeed."
7,"So was it worth it after all? The daisy-cutters and the cluster bombs, the misguided missiles butchering wedding parties while al-Qaida slipped away? Now, a year after Kabul fell as the Taliban left their hot dinners on the front line and ran, was it worth the killing of anything from 800 to 3,000 men, women and children? Of course it was, said everyone I asked. They all had their grotesque Taliban tales. ""Right there, bodies hanging, rotting, stinking!"" said a trader in Chicken Street, the tourist trinket centre. Taliban horror stories poured out of everyone, unstoppable like water from a broken tap: ""I was walking with my cousin and her husband outside here,"" said another man. ""The vice and virtue police beat them both with big sticks, beat them to pieces, blood everywhere, because her ankles showed too much under her burka. I stood there, ashamed, but there was nothing I could do. I didn't go out after that."" He was a young Pashtun and no friend of this new mainly Tajik government, but he had no doubt that the Americans did the right thing.  An old carpet-maker in a village out west was standing in his backyard beside the loom where his daughter was click-clacking at the warp and woof. Was it worth it, I asked? He pointed up at the sky: ""We shouted with joy when the American planes came over this way. They hit a Taliban police barracks down the road. Boom! It was a big ammunition dump, we knew that. But we were amazed at how precise it was. Yes, we cheered!""  Not surprising, perhaps, as this is Hazara territory, the downtrodden, spat-upon tribe that makes up 20% of the population. But what of the bombs that missed, the innocent dead, among them Hazaras too? Hussain Dad spread his arms wide: ""How many more do you think the Taliban would have killed in this last year? Thousands! And they would still be killing now. I hardly went out then. If you saw a Talib coming down the street, you hid your face, you looked away. If you looked at them, they said, 'Who are you looking at?' and they beat you for nothing.""  His daughter Hakima is 21 and was locked indoors for many of the Taliban years, but now she is back at a newly opened school down the road. Her classroom is a tent in a dusty yard where she sits in her white headscarf, towering above the young children: ""I don't mind sitting with the little ones. I need to learn,"" she said.  Everywhere the avid appetite for education is so intense that schools with classes of 48 teach reading and writing in a year. In the school for street children that I visited, where each child did a three-hour shift each day between street work picking up paper or selling water, they sat on benches, repeating by rote off the blackboard. All ages are eager to make up for lost time; most boys' schools also had to close under the Taliban because their women teachers were forbidden.  There must be people who think the American-led conquest was wrong, but no one will say so. Even Pashtuns you meet from the Taliban's own tribe - the big losers under the new regime - say the outside world had a duty to rescue them from the Taliban horror. But perhaps some lie. Perhaps you are looking right into the eye of a shaved Talib, one of the multitude who just melted away into the shadows, waiting and watching for their time to come again. Which it might, if the world again loses interest here.  As for the outside world, the first question westerners ask is: have the women taken off their burkas? The burka was the battle flag of last year's brief war. For the Taliban, a wisp of woman's hair or an uncovered female foot represented an obscenity leading not just to adultery, pornography and the destruction of family, but to the fall of Islam itself. For the west, the burka was the easy symbol of Taliban oppression, a shorthand moral justification for liberating Afghanistan, with girls' schools shut, women forbidden to work, sent home and locked indoors: there was even a Taliban edict forbidding women's shoes from making a noise on the ground. Shrouded in pale blue prisons with tiny grilles restricting their vision, even women who in communist times wore mini skirts were buried alive in these stifling pleated gowns.  So did things get better for them in this last year? Nine out of 10 women still wear burkas: those who ripped them off to swap them for headscarves are few. The burka's ghostly outline still turns women into subhuman objects, non-persons. Now they walk alone in the streets without the need for a male relative, but often they stay together in small flotillas, and it's easy to see why. Drivers seem to charge at them as they cross the streets. They are jostled aside on pavements as men seem irritated by these faceless, depersonalised obstacles in their path. Travelling in cars full of men, women in burkas often peer out of the back window from the cramped space of hatchback car boots. Poor women begging are chased out of the way by angry shopkeepers.  The pathological loathing of women by the Taliban didn't spring from nowhere, nor has it evaporated overnight. This is an apartheid society, a bifurcated human race where one half has been systematically excised: mothers, wives, daughters are only empty vessels, the regrettable and disgusting physical function through which men must deign to be born. Men are everything to one another here and their warm and public emotion can be a touching sight. They hug, kiss, embrace, weep together, delighting in each other's company, laughing and probably making love quite a lot too. (Battles between warlords have been fought recently over beautiful boys, often involving kidnap and male rape.) British public-school bonding with the Afghan men of the mountains continues to this day. On my way out I picked up the latest award-winning Afghan travel book, and it was full of the same weird British romance for rugged men in rugged mountains. The only mention of women was a passing reference to the doe-eyed houris promised in heaven by the Prophet to every jihad martyr.  At the Woman to Woman centre, 20 women of all ages were sitting on the floor, all them with burkas left hanging on pegs by the door. Despite the absence of outward change, were things getting better for them now that the Taliban had gone? There was a spontanteous chorus of cries, hands raised in the air, laughter, sighing, exclamations - my translator could not keep up with their energetic assertions that life had changed beyond recognition. This relative liberation - freedom to walk outside for many who had never left their one room in years - was hard to imagine. ""I never saw the light of day in five years!"" one widow said.  So why did they still wear burkas? A gnarled and toothless old woman from the countryside (who might be no more than 50 - already beyond the average life expectancy here) said she had worn hers since she was seven and she could not imagine the nakedness of going without it. But she thought the younger women soon would and should shed it. These women were the poorest, many of them homeless, uprooted by war, or among the country's two million war widows. ""We wear the burka because we are still afraid,"" several said. It is too dangerous; and besides, the psychological effect of five years of terror is not easily erased at a stroke. How many thought they would take them off some time soon? Eight of the 20 raised their hands, mostly the younger ones, though only five said they had ever worn a burka before the Taliban came.  However symbolic they seem, the truth is that the burka is the very least of their problems, mere outward garments, easily discarded. The inner scars of the way women are treated here in this darkly savage place will be harder to erase. As the women talked of their lives, terrible stories tumbled out. Though none of them knew each other already, they wept when they listened to one another. Fahina, a woman in her 30s, wearing a thin black veil and swaying back and forth a little as she spoke, began to tell how she was beaten daily by her husband, a drug addict who had sold everything in the house. So why did this woman not leave a dangerous drug-addict husband who drained her money away? Because, she explained, she would have to leave her 12-year-old daughter behind with him. By now several other women were crying in sympathy.  At the start of this session, many had proclaimed that women should have absolutely equal rights with men, so I asked the translator if they thought it right and fair that this abusive father should keep the child. The translator looked at me nervously and whispered, ""I don't think I can ask that."" ""Why not?"" ""Because it is our Islamic law, in the Koran, that after the age of nine a daughter belongs to the father."" ""But ask them if it is fair in this extreme case?"" Quietly the translator asked them, and they fell silent and gazed down at the carpet. No one spoke until Fahina, the battered wife, said softly, ""It is the law"", with tears falling down her face. Once the shutter of religion falls, the rest is silence. The women are indoctrinated so deep with it that their own inferiority is branded on their brains. Every time sophisticated Muslims in the west use sophistry to explain that the prophet was actually a great liberator of women, every time they fail to condemn outright some of the Koranic laws themselves and demand reformation, they help condemn women across the Islamic world to this self-immolating damage.  It was time to go, and the women pulled on their burkas and walked out into the street. Under the flapping blue pleats many younger women now wear high heels: as one clacked away down the street, I considered this strange cultural juxtaposition. The west hobbles its women with toe-crushing shoes, Islam with burkas and chadors. But right now in this benighted place, those high heels under the burka look like the first defiant glimmer of liberation.  Hamid Karzai's minister of women's affairs is Mahuba Hoququmal, professor of law at Kabul University, which was closed down in Taliban times when she too was sent home in a burka before fleeing abroad like virtually all other educated people. A distinguished woman in her 60s, she was dressed in a gossamer beige scarf and seated in her large but empty office, offering rose-flavoured tea. She was surprisingly blunt: ""We are in a very dangerous position at this moment. After the loya jirga insisted on changing the name of the country to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the fundamentalists are fighting to have Sharia law here. We need progressive civil law.""  That very day, the new Constitutional Commission had just been formally opened by the Aga Khan, and a mighty battle is now beginning over the heart and soul of the country: a bill of human rights or an Islamic Sharia constitution? Yet again, the future of the country is to be fought out symbolically over women's bodies. ""The test of the new constituion will be whether women have absolute equality enshrined in it.""  Did Hoququmal think that she and her fellow campaigners would win? She shrugged and spread out her hands: ""Only if the west stays here and keeps the fundamentalists down. If you leave us, they will rise up again and take control. Already the security situation is very dangerous, Kabul does not yet rule the country and there are not enough international troops, none outside Kabul. If the Americans attack Iraq, then I fear you will all forget about us.""  Only weeks ago Afghanistan was a whisker away from plunging back into chaos after a bullet whistled past President Karzai. Violence breaks out often - last week two newly opened girls' schools were bombed and two musicians at a wedding party were beaten by anti-music Islamic fundamentalists. If they get Karzai, there is no plan B, no understudy learning his lines. One senior British official told me: ""If they get him, pack fast.""  Two government ministers have been shot dead in the last few months, one probably at the instigation of defence minister Field Marshal Fahim, a thuggish warlord with 10,000 men of his own. But he wears a suit now and sits behind his desk talking the talk of the new multi-ethnic Afghan national army that will soon be in place to keep the peace across the land. The Brits will tell you with a straight face what a good chap he has become and how fast he is learning the new skills of politics under western tutelage. In theory he will soon be running an indigenous, multi-ethnic army, yet the new recruits trained by various western nations have no uniforms, guns or pay.  Everything here is rumour, assertion, malicious factoid or wishful romance. On the one hand, British and American officials will tell fables of such staggeringly unreal optimism that you wonder their eyes don't pop out and roll away. On the other, there are doom merchants of every variety and faction who will tell you that the place is cursed to perpetual anarchy and mayhem - nothing can save it now or ever. Some have a deep, dark interest in undermining all efforts at reconstruction, spreading the Nothing Works anti-western message for their own nefarious political ends. Others are trying hard to make it work, but are exhausted and close to despair, with shamefully little money.  The truth is that every day that civil war does not resume is a minor miracle. Every day of peace builds more trust in the future. There are plenty of green shoots of hope, just as there are plenty of intimations of doom. With each passing week, new stalls and bazaars spring up along the roadsides up and down the country. In the rubble that is 70% of Kabul, people are starting to rebuild, making mud bricks with their bare hands, having given up on early hopes that reconstruction would be done for them. Even in the most desolate, bombed-out places, life is returning to normal as refugees flood back.  High up in Estalif, a village to the north of Kabul that looked utterly destroyed, a family were growing tomatoes in the ruins of their home, while camping outside for the winter with a family next door who had only two rooms. They would rebuild in the spring, but were desperate for help: ""Do not abandon us now!"" the father begged - a refrain that you hear everywhere.  Some distance north, on the Shamali plain at the crossroads of Qarabak, some hundred stalls have sprung up in the last month. This tragic place was once the golden bread basket of the country, rich with vines, tomatoes, almond trees and orchards. In one battle, the retreating Taliban razed and scorched the land for a hundred miles in every direction, chopping down fruit trees, burning vines, poisoning thousands of wells and smashing the ancient underground irrigation system. Here ACTED, a French charity financed by Clare Short, is giving returning refugees basic shelter kits to build new houses - beams, windows, doors. An agricutural cooperative lets people borrow seed, fertilizers and tractors. Women are being given chickens, vegetable seeds and implements.  But here, as everywhere else, the scheme is swamped by the sheer scale of need. Last week the weather turned suddenly cooler, the first sign of a winter fast approaching. There are only a couple of weeks left in which shelters can be built and the money for more has run out. Twenty thousand shelter kits have been provided, but 40,000 families here have nothing but tents to survive the bitter winter snow.  The same story is reported everywhere, as 1.5 million refugees have poured back to ruin and desolation. Standing outside a tent in the pouring rain, I talked to two women cowering inside. They were unable to step out while strange men were near, so they called out answers to my questions to their brother who stood outside, a scarf hiding the half of his face that had been blasted away in the fighting. It was a laborious process: he called out their responses to my (male) translator, who stood far away, relaying the translation back to me. Since their responses were short and his were long, I doubted that I was hearing much from the women themselves. Men here have a habit of simply not listening to women, as if their voices were in some inaudible dog-whistle register. But what the young man with the blown-away face said was this: ""This is what we have returned to! We were promised by the world that if we fought the Russians for you, you would look after us, but you didn't. Then we fought the Taliban and al-Qaida, and now look at us, here on this hillside in the mud, the winter coming and our children will die of cold. Where is your help now?""  Wherever you go, they say the same. Thanks for coming, the war was worth it, but now it is payback time. Lifting the iron heel of the Taliban was not enough. In Tokyo, the rich world agreed to stump up only a paltry $4.5bn for Afghanistan over five years. It is a mere $75 a head per year, while world aid to Rwanda, East Timor and Bosnia was $250 a head. Why so little? And why has even this been paid out painfully slowly when the need is urgent?  The Karzai government last week fixed its budget for next year: it is just $460m, less than that of most English local authorities. $1.2bn has been spent already, most of it on emergency food, not reconstruction. ""One of the most miserable states in the world,"" the World Bank rightly called Afghanistan. It is the fourth poorest place on earth: 95% are illiterate, and 95% have never seen a doctor or nurse in their lives.  It was never much better: under the old king before 1978, Afghanistan was still the fifth poorest country in the world. In the 23 years since then, this blighted nation has passed through all the circles of hell known to political organisation. Starting with a brutal feudalism under an absolute and arbitrary monarch, it subsequently saw savage communism, followed by total anarchy among massacring warlords and finally the Taliban's grotesque religious fascism. Anything that passes for the beginnings of democracy here will be a remarkable achievement.  Imagine Afghanistan today as something like England under a weak King John, with the recent  loya jirga much like the warlords at Runnymede writing the Magna Carta: a start, but hardly Athens in the golden age. Afghan barons rule their feudal fiefdoms and fighting still breaks out between them in small turf dust-ups, such as that between Dostum and Atta in the North. Ismail Khan, lord of the west, controls the country's only rich pickings on the Iranian border, ruling with absolute disregard of Kabul, remitting none of his fat border extortions to the central gov ernment. In the south, the angry, excluded Pashtun majority festers and fumes dangerously, lobbing the occasional bomb at the US army, which pokes and prods the populace insensitively, still failing to find al-Qaida.  Nothing can save this place but long-standing military presence by ISAF, the international force currently headed by the Turks. If the west looks away, the surrounding tyrannous countries will be back to their old tricks, arming warlords to fight their own rivalries by proxy. The US, seemingly having learned nothing from past experience, has this year again armed some of the worst warlords, who pretended to search for al-Qaida operatives yet yielded nothing.  And yet in a country holding its breath, with every day of peace, Kabul's influence grows a little stronger. War zones attract an astounding whirl of people. Kabul is awash with seasoned professionals, hopeful carpet-baggers, long-exiled, educated Afghans wanting to help or to cash in, or a bit of both. Old NGO hands greet each other, recalling great times in East Timor, Rwanda, Bosnia or Kosovo. ""Last met in Mogadishu! How's Mad Jack, ha ha?"" An Australian doctor with a magic box of dressing-up clothes and masks takes it out to traumatised children in war zones to help them act out their feelings: he hasn't missed a war in years.  Things here are often not what they seem. At a party of Afghan returners in an old Soviet-era concrete flat one night, a man in full Afghan rig was playing the rebob - a kind of Afghan sitar. Was he a musician returning after the Taliban music ban? No, he was Dr John Baily, reader in ethnomusicology from Goldsmiths College. One woman was keen to set up a new charity for sufferers of type 2 diabetes: I suggested she look at the children's hospital first. There had been no electricity there for two days when I visited: the two generators sent from Japan were unusable without money for the oil to run them. The only rusty oxygen flask had run out and minute babies newborn to malnourished mothers were turning grey and dying before my eyes. A boy with both hands and one foot blasted away by a landmine was lying groaning on a sheetless mattress with no pain relief and no parents.  The western presence brings its own trials and tribulations. Kabul property prices have shot through the roof. The 30% of the town left standing is jammed with UN agencies and non-governmental organisations - scores from each western nation, 1,025 in all. Between them they have seized every habitable house, sending rents that were $150 a month not long ago up to $2,000 a month now. This has brought many middle-class Afghans pouring home to repossess their now extortionately valuable properties, but poorer ones have no hope of finding affordable homes here. There is, anyway, precious little electricity, clean water, sewerage, telephones or anything else.  Seething resentment of the UN and the NGOs bursts out everywhere, with the usual unavoidable ugly spectacle of highly paid western aid experts rubbing up against Karzai cabinet ministers who earn only $35 a month. ""They expect Pringles wherever they go,"" said one Afghan aid worker acidly of the itinerant aid community.  When I spoke to the Afghan minister for public works, he flailed his long arms in the air, expostulating with frustration, claiming that the UN and NGOs spend all the country's donated money, and spend it badly. ""Stand outside my window and you'll see 200 white Land Cruisers pass by in an hour, I swear it! Our money, they spend! How can I build my roads?""  Another minister - for housing and planning - lists outrageous extravagances by foreign agencies, but in the same breath despairs of his own barely literate civil servants' ability to deliver anything. He says he sent them on a four-month ""capacity building"" course, but they came back no better. The civil service is choked with over 300,000 cronies of all the past regimes, all unsackable. The Karzai government needs to earn credibility fast with some reconstruction that everyone can see. The UN says it has vaccinated 6 million Afghan children against polio, but that is an invisible investment.  Fewer by the day now are the buccaneering freelance journalists and photographers. They are grumbling that the story has gone cold here: work is drying up. Fox News has already pulled out and the other US networks are off soon, itching to move on to Iraq. ""Next year in Baghdad!"" the journos and the old NGO hands call out cheerily when anyone leaves.  Has the Afghan story gone cold? I am not sure whether to hope or fear it. One one hand, the story going cold would mean an absence of war: no more footage of fighting men in pancake hats perched up in the mountains firing off Stingers into what's left of Kabul. No more bleeding Afghan children and women screaming into their burkas.  But the story growing cold may also mean that the world forgets and walks away bored, looking for the next hot new war. If the west turns its back now and lets the country slide back into tribal warfare and despair, there will be no moral justification for any future great interventions in the name of human rights. History will write this episode down as no more than a brief, self-interested expedition to eliminate al-Qaida training camps, another bunch of outsiders fighting their own battles on Afghan soil. Forget Tony Blair's impassioned vision of a western world committed to spreading freedom across the globe. There may be no more stony and infertile ground than this for planting democratic ideals, but if Afghanistan remains a miserably poor and oppressed place, then all that high-minded talk will be exposed as self-serving hypocrisy.  Much moral rhetoric accompanied this expedition: I was among those who welcomed the cluster bombs in the name of peace and freedom. And so far, removing the Taliban has been a great good. Who would not be moved by the sheer enthusiasm of those girls returning to school, determined to catch up on their studies? I saw the utter terror of the women who stayed indoors for years rather than risk random beatings, and their joy at escape.  Chasing away the Taliban has shown that ordinary people, given half a chance, choose music, dancing and kites over the extremes of life-denying fundamentalism. Just as the rich world has a duty to feed the starving, open up trade and help development, so we also have a duty to free people from monstrous oppression wherever there is a chance of doing them more good than harm by intervention. So far, here, there is no doubt that good has been done. But the prospect of lasting peace and respect for human rights in this desperate place hangs by a hair. All the old dark fundamentalist forces are waiting for Karzai to fail: only more money and deep commitment over many years offer any hope of keeping them at bay.  Afghanistan needs far more money than the Karzai's disgraceful $460m for next year (roughly the same sum as the British treasury has wasted on drawing up contracts for the London tube public/private partnership.) It is incumbent on all those of us who supported the war to keep the world's brief and fickle attention focused on the task of trying to build a nation from the rubble."
7,"Occasionally a new piece of research demolishes a myth with one fell blow. It does not happen often (social research tends to run along familiar tracks), but once in a while an iconoclastic study changes ideas. No one reading Self-Esteem - The Costs and Causes of Low Self-Worth by Professor Nicholas Emler of the LSE, should feel quite at ease again using a modern piece of psychobabble that has infused the language of sociology, criminology and education without real scrutiny until now.  The accepted view has been that self-esteem - or the lack of it - lies at the root of almost every disorder from delinquency and drug abuse to violence and child abuse. One standard text after another takes this as a given fact without any scientific evidence, repeated as gospel from right to left, from Melanie Phillips to Oprah Winfrey. More than 2,000 books currently in print offer self-help prescriptions for raising self-esteem. A vast array of expensive social programmes in Europe and the US designed to solve drug dependency or delinquency are based on attempts to raise self-esteem. Some have tried to raise the self-esteem of whole schools or even an entire citizenry, describing self-esteem as a ""social vaccine"" against anti-social behaviour.   Low self-esteem is the zeitgeist social disease. It has many useful attributes: it elevates self-love and sanctifies self-satisfaction. It justifies the introspection of the therapy addict. It excuses bad behaviour, turning perpetrator into victim. For teachers, it makes dealing with bullying, arrogant and disruptive pupils almost impossible, if beneath the insufferable exterior there is supposed to be a whimpering, self-loathing child in need of affirmation and praise.   Professor Emler turns all this on its head. Scrutinising all the available research on both sides of the Atlantic, he finds no evidence that low self-esteem causes anti-social behaviour. Quite the reverse. Those who think highly of themselves are the ones most prone to violence and most likely to take risks, believing themselves invulnerable. They are more likely to commit crimes, drive dangerously, risk their health with drugs and alcohol. Exceptionally low self-esteem is indeed damaging - but only to the victim, not to anyone else. Those with low self-esteem are more likely to commit suicide, to be depressed, to become victims of bullying, domestic violence, loneliness and social ostracism.   There ought to be a collective sigh of relief among many professionals on reading this eye-opening work. It is one of those moments when the blindingly obvious suddenly emerges from a fog   of unquestioned nonsense. Teachers, social workers and probation officers do not have to massage the already inflated egos of bullies with unwarranted praise. Asserting his own superiority over his classmates, over-confident of abilities he does not have, it will do no harm to try to bring him down a peg.   Emler looks at the relation between self-esteem and academic success. Does competition in school cause damaging failure? Most surprisingly he concludes that academic success or failure has very little impact on pupils' self-esteem. High self-esteem pupils will explain away failure to suit their previous high opinions of themselves: they make excuses that they were unlucky, suffered some bias or that they didn't try. Odder still, those with low self-esteem will not be buoyed up by academic success either. Sadly, they will regard it as a fluke and continue with their previous low estimation of their abilities. He concludes that it is exceedingly difficult to shift people's pre-existing view of themselves, even with tangible success. Nor is self- esteem any predictor of how well or badly someone will do academically. Even if confidence boosting worked (which he doubts) it would have no effect on exam results.   So where does self-esteem come from? Looking at studies of twins, Emler concludes that genetic predisposition has the single strongest effect. Less surprisingly, after that it is parental attitudes. If they love, reinforce, praise and respect a young child, the effect lasts for life. Physical and above all sexual abuse of children is devastatingly and permanently damaging to self-esteem.   Beyond these early influences, everything else that might be done to increase/ decrease self-esteem has virtually no effect. (This is bad news for the therapy business.) An interesting example: it was assumed that to belong to an outcast ethnic minority would harm self-esteem, but Emler finds it has no effect. People draw self-esteem from the good opinions of their own group and reject abuse from outsiders as the fault of others, not their own.   Men have slightly more self-esteem than women. Low self-esteem in young women does increase the risk of teenage pregnancy, while low self-esteem in boys increases the risk of   unemployment later in life. Anxiety about appearance does undermine women's self-esteem. But Emler's more curious finding is that there is very little correlation between how people think they look and how they actually look: their perceptions about their appearance are shaped by their level of self-esteem. Altogether Emler finds people have profoundly unrealistic views of how others see them, both negative and positive. How we think we are perceived is shaped by self-esteem.   His conclusion is that all the myriad programmes designed to cure anti-social behaviour by raising self-esteem are wasting their time. Better by far to concentrate on the particular drug or crime problem and not on an imagined self-esteem deficit: self-esteem enhancing programmes he describes as ""snake-oil remedies"".   This research deserves to cause a stir. It was always a kindly liberal notion that inside the anti-social bully was a timorous, tender soul waiting to be released. Emler is not suggesting that the violent are not damaged or might not be cured, but he has conclusively dismissed the intellectually woolly concept that lack of ""self-esteem"" is the root of all evil."
7,"In his own inimitable words, let no one ""misunderestimate"" George W Bush. He is the most rightwing president in living memory. If this is compassionate conservatism, what does the other sort look like? In less than 100 days he has turned America into a pariah, made enemies of the entire world, his only friends the dirty polluters of the oil industry who put him there. His foreign non-policy is a calamity, brilliantly uniting Russia and China with gratuitous offence and threat. The Republican leader of the senate environment committee's last-minute cancellation of an urgent global warming meeting with the EU environment commissioner on Monday was like a cold war tactical snub from the Khrushchev era. Europe gets the message, so did an outraged Japan. The rest of the world draws instinctively together in its repudiation of the Bush Jnr White House. Through this strange global vandalism, the leader of the free world has become the rogue. Ungracious in victory, absolute power corrupting absolutely, the only super-power is morphing into an evil empire of its own.  Where to begin on America the Horrible? Start with it tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to install a national missile defence system, recreating a new cold war with China as No 1 enemy. North Korean ""sunshine"" detente is over. NDM only gives the US an illusion of invulnerability in a world it makes more dangerous. World trade negotiations were wrecked by US self-   interest. Not a cent has been paid of the US promised $600m for third world debt-relief. While US wealth soared in the last decade, only 20% of its citizens gained but his budget includes a $1.6 trillion tax cut, most for the richest. The toxic Texan (he left behind the filthiest state) denies global warming and urges oil drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Arctic Refuge. He even abolished regulations limiting arsenic in drinking water and cut black-lung benefits. This richest nation on earth will never lead a redistributive global politics while so unconcerned about third world poverty among its own. No, there is no lack of material for a thoroughly satisfying rant.  It was at a press conference an insulting half an hour before meeting German Chancellor Gerhard Schr&ouml;der that Bush spoke his heart on the Kyoto climate change treaty. Those words will become a classic clip, pursuing him through eternity. It was the way he thumped the podium and smirked as he said it, (even this was inarticulate): ""We will not do anything that harms our economy, because first things first are the people who live in America."" There we have it. Screw the world, Americans always come first.  In the past presidents always gave Americans a self-image that was noble, a global purpose in the vanguard of democracy, spiritually still a young revolutionary state, with quotes aplenty. That raw energy and self-belief has always thrilled and mesmerised outsiders. Whatever hot debates about America's true intentions (selfishness lurks beneath altruism in all international horse-trading), the country always had a fine story to tell itself about its mission. Late and reluctant into two world wars, the star-spangled cavalry did arrive at last. Delinquent or deluded in Vietnam, there was a fight to be had for freedom against Ho Chi Minh's communist invaders, a good story to be told.  In Kosovo the zero-body bag cowardice of fighting from too high to hit the targets was matched by the nobility of fighting at all in a place so far from Kalamazoo. American huddled masses yearning to breathe free always needed the Hollywood version of their politics and quite rightly so. Who can bear to be bad? So the brazen nudity of Bush's words must have shocked millions of Americans from coast to coast - and in that is the best hope of better to come.  The global response was instant and visceral. Blistering editorials poured out of the press from Brazil to Belgium, Tokyo to Turin. Politicians were barely more controlled. Some 45 editorials across American newspapers condemned their president. Our own John Prescott said: ""The US cannot sit in glorious isolation ... It must know it cannot pollute the world while free-riding on action by everyone else."" What next? Attack! Boycott Gallo wines, McDonald's, Texaco and Exxon-Mobil. Why not? It may satisfy revenge, it may even deliver a jolt or two, but as official policy this is as unlikely to change hearts and minds in the evil empire as futile gesturing was against the USSR in cold war days.  One way or another the US has to be persuaded to take global warming seriously. The fierce argument among Kyoto signatories is how to do it. The US agreed (but never ratified) cutting emissions by 7% from its 1990 levels, by 2010. Due to Clinton's self-destruction and his ""third way"" ducking of anything difficult when faced with republican obstruction, that commitment is now effectively impossible. The US boom means it would now take a 30% cut to hit the target. Cheap fuel is designed into America's unimaginably vast prairies of suburbia without buses or town centres. True, the fashion for four-wheel drive monsters has eaten up all technological gains in fuel efficiency. True, that $1.6 trillion tax cut should go on public transport and clean energy, but only a cultural revolution could deliver a one third reduction now.  Since a quarter of the world's carbon output is here, letting America progress at a slower pace makes sense. Blame is satis fying, but survival depends on results.  It was the detail of this debate that made Prescott storm out of the stalled Hague negotiations in November. He said realism required letting the US cheat a bit by buying spare emissions from Russia and planting forests. Greens said their calculations showed this meant the US need make no other effort at all to change its ways. But getting Americans to accept the idea of fundamental change is the crucial first step. The world needs a 60% cut within 50-100 years and the crunch will come. If Kyoto progresses to ratification by all the other countries, the hope is that the US will want to join a carbon emissions trading bloc. The threat of trade tariffs against US goods to balance their unfair lack of pollution control was posed by the EU environment commissioner: ""Why should the US play by other rules than European companies?""  With all eyes fixed on US public opinion, some polls find 75% ""very concerned"", but Californian black-outs make energy shortages hotter news. Democrats and some Republicans think Bush has made a bad political mistake: his mangled words will have to be eaten soon. For the rest of the world, how much threat and fury, how much backroom dealing it will take to reel the rogue state back in, is a delicate calculation: there must be no further splits. Good, bad or ugly, saving the world without America may not be impossible, just exceedingly unlikely."
7,"Making incapacity benefit claimants display their wounds every three years is, in the prime minister's words, ""entirely sensible and justified"". These are not wheelchair users or the severely disabled but the many who might be capable of work. In the ongoing march towards full employment, why should the lame and the halt be left out? Long-term unemployment casts people out of society, debilitates and destroys all but the most self-motivated. Work makes most people healthier, wealthier and probably wiser too. It is true that while the numbers of unemployed fell, the numbers on incapacity benefit quadrupled. Successive Tory employment ministers told local managers to shift claimants off the dole on to incapacity benefit (IB). I interviewed a job centre manager in the north-east at the time, who was explicitly ordered to shunt a set number on to IB every month, to make his unemployment figures seem to fall. He had a gun to his head, but he was torn between anger at this political chicanery and a deeper sense that it was all for the best. Shipyard workers in their fifties were not going to find jobs as filing clerks or waiters. If an extra £25 or so found its way into their pockets, it would help the devastated local economy a little. For men who had savings or working wives, there might be no dole at all on offer, so IB was the only way to help. Illegal, yes; disreputable, no - not in these pitiful circumstances. And the government said so too, for its own bad reasons.  This is why the staggeringly high rates of incapacity are all in the places with the highest unemployment figures - in Merthyr Tydfil an extraordinary 26% of all men aged between 16 and 64 signed on for incapacity benefit. (Unemployment does make people ill.) Compare that to Berkshire where everyone has a job and only 5% draw incapacity benefit, most of them seriously disabled. In good employment areas, less seriously disabled people work - some 3m of them. But not surprisingly, where there are no jobs, they don't. Professor Stephen Fothergill of Sheffield Hallam University, expert in incapacity, reckons about half of incapacity claimants could work at something not too strenuous - except that most of them live in places without jobs.  So the question for the government is this. Faced with Merthyr, Knowsley or Liverpool, places overwhelmed by unemployment, why worry about the less healthy, less motivated people until the rest have work first? If the government had an active employment policy for dealing with the wastelands of the coalfields, the dockyards and steel, this might make sense. If jobs galore were being created, if vacancies yawned, then it would be worth chivvying the weak and the depressed into taking them.   But the words ""job creation"" are not in the chancellor's vocabulary (Alistair Darling is just his mouthpiece). Gordon Brown will have none of this French type of social engineering. Regeneration yes, he says, but job creation - absolutely no. The New Deal has been brilliant in places near enough to jobs.   Personal advisers from the employment service are a higher calibre cadre with an armoury of better offers, spending more money per job-placement than most other countries. But as national employment figures get better, the black spots look worse.  So, why? That is the mystery. At Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour benches were scowling. Not one sycophantic question oozed from any of them. Silent as the grave, not a cheer passed their lips. How can it be, they were asking, that the government has learned so little?   Attacking the disabled is daft politics - even if there are savings to be had. (However, any savings from this are not expected for 10-15 years.) Even if there were some big gain, has the chancellor learned nothing and forgotten nothing? Remember the Daily Mail's campaign to find disabled families suffering under the last reform? Wait for the first quadriplegic to get a threatening letter. (It will happen.) How are the MPs to go back and explain this to their constituencies?  When New Labour first spun its electoral gold, the genius of the project was a deep understanding of political symbolism. With every breath they billowed out smoke signals that could be seen from coast to coast. That red rose may have looked like the logo on a 1950s ladies' sanitary product, but its every petal signified a soft, feminine, gentler party. Ditching Clause IV was an empty enterprise since no one thought Labour likely to nationalise the stock exchange, but it needed doing purely for the sake of the gesture.   Politics needs signposts and symbols, but Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have forgotten. A limping election campaign has been followed by a crippled four weeks, and now every day they shoot another bullet into their feet.  The calamity of the London tube has been another of Gordon Brown's personal madnesses - obstinate, proud and wrong. Yesterday, after four long years of worsening conditions because of his fixation with a particular form of privatisation unsupported by anyone else (not even the PM who tried to ease this impasse), a needlessly lethal row has been added to needless delay. It will now be five years, next April, before it is handed over to Transport for London and work begins. Private finance initiatives everywhere have delayed government spending, as well as hanging a culpable debt on future generations, just to let the chancellor make his spending look more prudent on paper.  Meanwhile, veiled threats on NHS and school privatisation are causing pointless anguish, because neither Blair nor Brown will say that the public sector at its best  is best: few quarrel with using private alternatives at the margins. Why not say roughly what percentage of private provision they have in mind?  Nothing they have said or done since that spectacular second victory tells a strangely disaffected country where the government is going. ""Schools and hospitals"" was not a direction or a symbol. They are inert things. As a campaign slogan it signified nothing except managerialism.   Every gesture and signpost in the last month has been wrong. No one is pleased. Who is all this directed at? What for? Now there will be wheelchairs chained to Downing Street again. Tony Blair's performance in parliament on Wednesday suggests he doesn't get it. He isn't hearing it. The ""project"" is reduced to managing targets with no vision.  There is deep dismay on the backbenches. Charles Clarke eloquently reassured Labour MPs on Wednesday about his role, not as dictator of the party but as the missing link between the party and the leadership: he may be the man to carry their message to the leaders.   What is needed now is not show-off rebellions by old parliamentary warhorses, but a united flexing of muscles by Labour MPs to demand consultation so they can stop bad mistakes before they happen. And restore purpose and idealism to their enterprise."
7,"Who said these wise words in the House of Commons? ""In this spirit of great caring, dredging up personal cases of misery to try to find the one case that has gone badly in the NHS and overlooking all the reforms and successes that we have had, they have resorted to the lowest form of political debate."" Was that Tony Blair this week? No, it was Tory shadow health spokesman Dr Liam Fox, in his maiden speech on May 12 1992. He spoke in the wake of the Jennifer's Ear debacle during the 1992 election, when Labour had used a child's case in an emotive party political broadcast and - as these things do - it blew up in their face. Dr Fox was dead right.  That story too descended into farce as Jennifer's semi-separated parents rowed in public and it turned out that her mother was a Tory council candidate while her Labour-inclined father offered up her case to the party campaign machine. Families, we all know, are messy confused affairs with all kinds of internal dynamics and surprises. Now the family of Rose Addis have (unwisely) offered themselves up for public inspection by going straight to the Evening Standard with their version of their grandmother's treatment at the Whittington Hospital. The hospital's chief executive rightly sprang to the defence of his staff with a robust letter refuting every point of the family's complaint.   Then all hell broke loose in the Commons as Iain Duncan Smith made the beginner's mistake of not triple-checking the facts. (The Tories are still green about cases that turn into political landmines.) Blair was genuinely angry and Duncan Smith lashed out, sensing that he may have fallen into an elephant trap. Things went from bad to worse as the hospital - the angriest of all - spelled out that the old lady refused to be undressed by black nurses. They gave Duncan Smith a furious walloping for raising a case without calling them first, demanding an apology. But nothing ever looks crystal clear. The hospital's hint that the old lady refused to be touched by black hands may have raised doubts about whether a confused 94-year-old was dumped by angry, offended nurses. Allow real life into political debate and things turn foggy.   An independent witness spoke to me yesterday, outraged at the allegations against the Whittington. Jean Christodoulo was in the next door cubicle to Rose Addis, and she saw and listened to her most of the day. ""She was very confused and the doctors and nurses were in to see her all the time, gave her a cardiogram and were very good with her,"" Jean Christodoulo said. ""She refused to be cared for by a black nurse. She was in a terrible state and they were trying to clean her up but she would not let them. Sometimes she did not know where she was and kept calling out that she had lost her keys, very distraught, but they were really patient and caring. I was incensed when I saw her grandson on television saying she was not racist. I heard her shouting 'I don't want you touching me!' to a black nurse. I know those nurses and they are very nice, but maybe she was just confused. They couldn't have been more caring to her or to me. It's all political.""   The hospital's medical director, Professor James Malone-Lee (a Labour activist, it turns out) said what every family in the country must have thought when he suggested that Mrs Addis's relatives ""had not helped at all"" by failing to visit her for two days. ""I regret to say it is not unusual for it to take such a long time for the family of elderly patients to visit."" But families are not simple: who knows what their relationship is?   The family put themselves up for such speculation by making the public allegations about Mrs Addis's treatment when they were not there to see for themselves. They could have used the Whittington's very good complaints procedure, but preferred the Evening Standard, newly edited by an apparatchik from the Mail which specialises in these frontpage NHS shockers. With breathtaking cheek - and surely some political motive - the grandson is now protesting about Downing Street: ""I think it is an absolute disgrace they have committed such an intrusion. They may have breached codes of practice."" He was considering legal action.    Now the saga is unravelling, the entire Tory press has spun the story on its head and thundered into attacks on Labour for breaching patient confidentiality, as if Labour brought the case of this sad old lady to public attention. Does that mean the opposition and their press can use any case and no one can defend either hospital or government? Labour only repeated what the hospital had already said in an open letter. The peculiar question is whether doctors are allowed to use key patient information in public to clear themselves from calumny.   Department of Health guidelines and BMA advice suggest that where a family puts information in the public domain, doctors are allowed to answer allegations with their version of the facts. The government should rush to sign today's BMA call for all parties to pledge no breaches in confidentiality, and all facts to be checked first. Will the Tories sign too?   Who won? Labour, on points. But did   they really? Most people only have half an eye on the news, so all that remains of poor Rose's 15 minutes of fame may be an old lady badly treated. In Rose's wake, came a stream of ""My A&amp;E hell"" stories, many probably true. A&amp;E may be getting better - most refurbished with another £100m just announced, 600 more nurses and targets to admit-or-discharge all within four hours by 2004.   But ""better"" will never be 100%. This most public face of the NHS will still alarm on inner-city Saturday nights when eight out of 10 patients arrive with alcohol-related injuries and 65,000 staff were assaulted last year. That's why Casualty makes good TV drama.   How can the NHS escape death by a thousand anecdotes? The Kings Fund,   an independent health thinktank, yesterday called for ministers to withdraw to arm's length, giving real independence to each hospital. If only. The government already has similar plans but no seasoned observer imagines that it will ever be possible - here or in any other democracy - to stop health and its dramas being used as potent political ammunition by every opposition. How the Tory government blustered during Jennifer's Ear, accusing Labour of ""shroud-weaving"" and ""sick NHS stunts"". The best hope is that sharp and angry rebuttal by NHS staff themselves each time will see off political predators bent on proving that the NHS is unsustainable."
7,"The little town of Bethlehem does not lie still in deep or dreamless sleep. Instead a Palestinian altar boy was machine-gunned to death in Manger Square when Israeli tanks stormed in and occupied six Palestinian towns, leaving many others dead in their wake. Israeli hit-squad assassinations of suspected Palestinian terrorist leaders have now reached over 40 dead. But six days into Israeli occupation of Palestinian land, there is still no response from George Bush. A state department spokesman did call for Israeli withdrawal and behind the scenes pressure is being applied. But what is needed urgently is the same thunderous and threatening language the president applies to the war in Afghanistan. Spell it out - no more money, no more support, no sympathy for future attacks until Israel withdraws and talks start at once on building the promised independent Palestinian state.  Israel does not get the new global message, does not see how little patience its old friends have for Sharon's dangerous hard line. That is partly because the message has still not been delivered by presidential megaphone so that the whole world hears, announcing an end to the double standards of the west's treatment of Palestinians. As the war progresses in Afghanistan, the quid pro quo must come for Palestine. It will not wait: Afghanistan may not be resolved unless Palestine gets justice at the same time.   When I wrote recently about the need for Israel to withdraw back to its 1967 borders and dismantle its aggressive settlements, a sea of email accusations of anti-semitism swept in from all the over the world. Anyone calling for Israeli withdrawal gets these - and if they have a Jewish-sounding name it sometimes comes with the added insult that they must be ""self-hating Jews"".  Confident that they could always twist the arm of any president or Congress by threatening the Jewish vote, Israel has not needed to confront the way the world sees it until now. But the moment of truth came when Israel stopped being a lone victim of Islamic terrorism - all the west are victims or potential victims now. It is in danger of finding itself as alone as South Africa after the fall of communism. Ugly Israel is the Middle Eastern representative of ugly America - and though it is not the sole cause, Palestine is the rallying cry for the terrorism that hurled itself at the World Trade Centre. Once secure as the west's best friend, overnight Israel's failure to make peace has turned into a lethal liability.  Why, the Israelis ask angrily, should the world turn against them - victims acting in self-defence - instead of directing all anger at the perpetrators of suicide bombings and deliberate massacres of innocent Israeli civilians? Because, as Israel itself keeps pointing out, they remain one of us, ours, our people, partly our creation. The west that sustained and protected it in its fragility for all these years is also morally responsible for its behaviour and must take the blame for its abuses.  For the left, Israel was once Jerusalem the Golden, Zionist banners fluttered on Aldermaston peace marches, young idealists worked in summers on socialist kibbutzim, full of all the earnest hopes described in Linda Grant's excellent novel about early Israel, When I Lived in Modern Times. Now the left feels all the more betrayed by Ariel Sharon, war criminal, igniting the intifada by striding into the al-Aqsa mosque and using the trouble he caused to seize power.  The race-biased, them-and-us reporting of Israel/Palestine conflict works both ways. Consider the media coverage of death - how western audiences are invited to feel the agony of Israeli teenagers slaughtered in a disco or two poor 14-year-old Israeli boys bludgeoned to death in a cave, as if they were our own children. Palestinian deaths are rarely made so graphic or memorable: they are anonymous people, counted as numbers, bodies aloft among depersonalised funeral crowds.  Obituaries of murdered Israeli cabinet minister Rehavam Zeevi described a real man - obnoxious, rabid,   but a rounded man with a history, a hinterland, a family. In comparison obituaries of Abu Ali Mustafa, the 63-year-old head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine blown apart at his desk (for whom Zeevi was shot in revenge), mainly concerned the politics of his movement and what his death might presage, with no humanising idiosyncrasies.  If Israel succeeds in annexing our emotions, it also means Israelis reap a fiercer indignation when they do wrong - because the west feels angrily implicated in their crimes. The Palestinians may be the prime perpetrators, Hamas might be relentless in its wicked fantasy of sweeping Israel into the sea, but maybe our innate racism regards their alien sins as a political problem while emotionally demanding far better behaviour of our Israeli cousins. Palestinian terrorists are not right, but the miserable history of mutual blame and victimhood has to end now.  The map of Palestine is pock-marked with new Israeli settlements. The provocative concrete occupying the desert shocks the eye, while the frontline danger to which settlers deliberately expose their children horrifies. In 1998 Sharon urged them on: ""Everyone has to move, run and grab as many hilltops as they can to enlarge the settlements because everything we take now will stay ours... everything we don't grab will go to them."" Peace Now, the Israeli protest movement, says 25 new settlements have been established since Sharon's February election. Israel seems not to understand the fury these cause, not just among Muslims (though that must be decibels greater) but among Europeans who feel implicated in this mortgaging of future peace. Once there, how are they ever to be removed? By fighting? By Massada-type suicide protests? The festering Palestinian refugee camps must close too.  After Zeevi's death Ariel Sharon declared war on Arafat. Toppling the one faction that at least recognises Israel and seeks peace (and who would be certainly replaced by Hamas), is a revolutionary strategy designed to create a hyper-crisis to drag in the west. Hamas is as intent as Sharon on cataclysm. Sharon calls Zeevi's murder ""our September 11"", which it was not. He calls Arafat ""our Bin Laden"", which he is certainly not. But since the will to peace is not there, only the US can force its indebted client to see sense in time.  Indignation about injustice only flares up when the searchlight of public events falls upon that particular seething corner. Why care about Palestine now and not last year? Because it matters now, like the Taliban matters now. There is a right time for dealing with long-running oppressions - Serbia and Kosovo, or East Timor. Whatever the reason, when the chance comes it has to be seized and Tony Blair must urge the president to act loudly and decisively now, so all can see some good come of this."
7,"The right to die at the right time belongs in the liberal canon alongside the right to abortion. People own their bodies and neither church nor state can impose on anyone the obligation to live longer than they wish nor to bear a child against their will. It is an atheist tenet: the living body is all we have, all we inhabit and no higher power summons it to life nor decrees when that life ends. Catholics and other religions are the chief opponents of voluntary euthanasia because for them, only God disposes of life. When I interviewed Mother Teresa years ago, she explained that she would fight against contraception and euthanasia to her dying day because every soul born to starve on Calcutta's streets was still another soul to the glory of God - and every old person who gasped out one more agonising breath somehow contributed to this too. Religious opponents of euthanasia and abortion tend to hide theological objections in the practical problems of framing safe laws - but polls consistently show over 85% believe people should have the right to die when they want. Once life is not holy, people are free to do as they like with their own.  These humanist, post-enlightenment ideas permeate the new Human Rights Act, under which Diane Pretty this week seeks to have her life ended. Liberty, the group taking up her case, cites the right not to be subjected to ""inhuman and degrading treatment"". Mrs Pretty is in the last stages of motor neurone disease, which paralyses while leaving a lively brain to wait for death by slow suffocation. Her husband would risk a 14-year sentence if he assisted her suicide. Unlike more difficult ""living will"" cases, where people may no longer be able to express their wishes, she can still communicate via a one-finger typewriter. Suicide may be legal but the law discriminates against disabled people who need help to do it.  All this brings back sad memories. Jill Tweedie, much missed writer of this paper, died in 1993, also suffering from motor neurone disease. Soon after she was diagnosed, she asked me to make sure she could always die whenever she chose. The prospect of death was only bearable if she could at least control the time of her going. She was terrified of leaving it too late, so that like Diane Pretty she would be forced to endure the unendurable. She raged against some pious advisers who urged her to consider Stephen Hawking and all that she might still do. I promised her I would make sure she had the means to die, but I never had to. As she grew weaker, she told me she had already acquired pills which if taken together would be lethal. I thought the time was still far off, for although she could barely walk she seemed still so full of life.  I was to see her the next day, but there was no next day. A friend who saw her just before noticed her breathing was getting slightly wheezy, the first sign of what she feared most - slow asphyxiation. Left briefly alone, without telling anyone she quietly checked herself into a clinic and died that night. There was no doubt in our minds that she committed suicide, not waiting for the final ravages. It was typically stoical and decisive, causing no trouble to anyone, not wanting to leave her body at home as a problem for others. For those of us who thought there was still plenty of time, it was shocking. Couldn't she have waited a bit longer? Why yet? Why so alone when we could have been with her? But it was her decision. Only she knew how much disability she wanted to tolerate and when she had had enough.  Everyone has their own threshold for pain, dignity, the value or not of living another day and how to die. The idea that anyone - family or friends, let alone state or church - should have a say in this most private matter is grotesque. That is what she believed about both euthanasia and abortion and that is how she lived and died.  At the time, not a word was said about it in public. Yesterday, talking to the friend who saw her last, she agreed Jill would have written this herself if she were here to do it, an apt finale to her fine and honest autobiography. As it was, the clinic simply registered her as dead from MND, no autopsy - though they must have wondered. So no one came asking where she got the pills.   But the idea that whoever in the end provided them might be prosecuted is absurd. Maybe she might have lived longer and willingly endured more if only there had been a legal guarantee that she could summon a doctor to give her a gentle injection at any time. But she feared Diane Pretty's fate and feared putting her friends or family at legal risk.  The right-to-die principle may be simple, but under present laws the practice is often cruel. Some time ago, writing about people choosing to die, I visited an old bed-ridden rationalist who had decided to end her life, which had been spent in much campaigning, including for voluntary euthanasia. ""I don't want to end up all muddles and puddles,"" she told me crisply, though in much pain. The day was appointed, her affectionate family assembled, reluctantly agreeing to this last wish. But what seemed like a well-planned death turned out badly. They miscalculated how many pills it would take, how difficult it would be for her to swallow, and she ended up demanding a plastic bag over her head. They were haunted by this horrible scene, so far removed from the deathbed dignity they had planned. Why could she not have requested a doctor's injection?  Another suicidal person I met was a young quadriplegic, a motorcycle-accident victim, who kept saying he would rather be dead. Sport and bikes had been his life and he could not get interested in things of the mind. He too spat at the number of times well-meaning people mentioned Stephen Hawking. Once he drove his electric wheelchair to a nearby river to throw himself in, but at the bank his chair ran out of batteries. Despite much time at Stoke Mandeville with counsellors urging him to live, he set fire to his bungalow. I was unsure whether he should have been helped to die, but his death was horrible.  Allowing assisted suicide may raise Harold Shipman spectres, but the Dutch have done it well with two doctors and an ethicist reviewing every case. They do warn that free care for the old is a necessary safeguard against people feeling under pressure to die rather than use up their children's inheritance. Oregon allows terminal patients to request death, but only after referral for palliative care to ensure their pain is well treated first. As a result Oregon has the best pain-relief in the world and fewer patients choose to die. Meanwhile, thousands of British doctors risk prosecution by kindly helping patients die, while many patients kill themselves ineptly. Diane Pretty's plight must touch anyone who has witnessed her disease. However, the right place for this debate is parliament, with MPs, not judges, making new law.  "
7,"The middle-aged are the most discontented, reports Mori. They are the most disgruntled. Life seems not to have lived up to their expectations. This is odd, since most of them - at least two-thirds - have seen most things get a great deal better. Twenty years ago the country felt as if it was in freefall - first in the final year of Labour and then in the first years of Mrs Thatcher. Inflation was frighteningly high, unemployment destroyed a whole generation of school-leavers, and managers found themselves suddenly sacked too. The Italians overtook us economically. Insecurity was everywhere. But now we have just lived through a decade of the greatest growth and prosperity in living memory. The country is 35% richer and likely to grow by roughly the same over the next decade - barring disaster. There is more money in most pockets, more work, more home ownership, more holidays, more shopping. Most schools and hospitals have improved. Crime is lower than for a long time. Never have so many people been so educated. Life expectancy grows. Arts and leisure consumption is rising fast. Everything - except inequality - has got better for the majority.  So why the Victor Meldrew nation? Why the grizzling, mizzling, whingeing, whining? Complaint seems to have become a national language for general conversation. You hear it wherever you go, from dry cleaner's to wine bar and dinner table. The country is going to hell in a hand basket. Everything is dumbing down and on the slide, nothing is what it was. Neurotically, anything less than perfect becomes sinisterly symbolic of decline, every minor fault the thin edge of some horrible wedge. There is a panicky lack of proportion, a nervy fear that every shadow foretells the worst. Health scares send shivers down the collective spinelessness, as kitchen surfaces are scoured obsessively with Microban for fear of germs. Science and technology that brought the transforming wonder of the internet among its quantum leaps in discovery are regarded with the kind of superstitious suspicion that would like it burned at the stake. Who would think we had never been safer, wealthier or healthier?  All this is partly engendered by old-fashioned politics. Conservatives in opposition may be powerless, unable to raise the faintest scintilla of support for Iain Duncan Smith. But their mighty press can destroy and spread pessimism. Conservatives, after all, don't believe governments can ever deliver. They seek to demolish not just the achievements of this government but the theory that government itself is good: leave it to the private sector, to the individual family in its fortress, to the strivers on their own, never to the collective. Still outraged and disbelieving at finding themselves under a strong Labour government, the feel-bad Tory press resorts to an ever more bizarre Golden Ageism, set in some unspecified illusory era with a Disneyfied 1950s glow.  The left conspires in this gloom too. Pessimism is its natural state of mind: as long as anything is wrong, everything is wrong. With its own brand of cynicism, it too sneers at mere progress.  In the wider world, some observers suggest an unease about global disorder may disquiet people's sense of well-being. The cold war brought the shadow of the bomb, but keeping an evil empire at bay made grim Manichean sense of world politics. Now, in a world where George Bush holds the reins, everything seems senselessly anarchic.  At home, the performance and innovation unit's report on social capital showed the damage fear does. In Britain, people's trust in one another is far lower than in most of Europe. While the most successful countries - Norway, Switzerland and others - score 65% in trusting other people, Britain lags near the bottom at only 31%. Those who belong to clubs and societies tend to trust people more than those who live in isolation.  This lack of trust among strangers suggests a dysfunction that spills over into road rage and rude driving, not queuing but pushing at bus stops, or sudden anger and abuse in public. The right would say this incivility springs from the hedonistic, selfish, me-first 1960s generation. The left would say it is the fallout from Thatcherite individualistic grabbing in a free-for-all society. Either way, tabloids stoke up the sense that out there is a wild world in which every stranger seeks to do you down, if not to murder your child. Whoever is to blame, the loss of trust is a symptom of social pessimism.  What's to be done? In this mood, the government can keep hitting most of its targets, things can go on improving gradually, yet no one will notice or care, just grumble and sue. They may still vote for the least-worst party, but Labour needs to think harder about the things that make people feel better. Some of these are tangible and practical, others are difficult for politicians to tangle with. Politics trades most comfortably in things easily counted and measured.  Looking for quick hits in happiness, one stands out in every survey, yet again in this one from Mori. Work-life balance surveys of working misery now hit the desk several times a week, all saying the same glaringly obvious thing. In this dementedly overworked country, people are acutely unhappy about their working lives. In paid or unpaid overtime, most say they work too hard and this overwork complaint has soared in less than a decade as hours have lengthened. The government's record on this is disastrous. The only country to reject the EU working time directive, more than 4 million people now work over 48 hours, and many of them not voluntarily: it is a condition of their often low-paid job. (Overwork is not a high-fliers' syndrome.) Why not embrace it and enforce the directive?  The other great work complaint is powerlessness: Professor Michael White finds those who regulate their work harmoniously in consultation with employers are far happier. But again, the government set itself against the EU directive on consultation at work. These things the government can fix, alongside other working rights. Ignore the knee-jerk opposition by employers and devise a work-satisfaction charter. Free the people from their treadmills, shout it loud.  Once contentment is the goal, the mindset changes. What do people really want? What would they trade money for if extra money is not enough? Higher taxes might buy more of what they want: more gardens, swimming pools, classes for education and fun in fine new local buildings, bands in the park with dancing, more carnivals. Or palatial youth centres to delight every disaffected youngster in the neighbourhood.  Above all, politics has to offer a vision of progress, a national aspiration, a sense of purpose and a social trajectory. The third way never lifted the sights or talked of collective progress. It was all about nailing the failures, less about imaginative horizons. The glum country is partly the government's fault."
7,"So is this war? The noise from new trade union leaders Bob Crow (RMT), Mick Rix (Aslef) and Derek Simpson (Amicus) sent frissons of delight down the spines of the rightwing press. At last! History will repeat itself and the Tories sweep to power on the one issue that remains unassailably Mrs Thatcher's triumph. The public may blame her for 18 years of public service ruination and rusting infrastructure, but the one thing they give her in the saloon bars and the taxi cabs - she did stop the unions running the country. So is this a flicker of dawn in the long night of Tory opposition?  Almost certainly not. Tony Blair's reasonably emollient tones and his correspondingly good reception by the TUC yesterday suggest that the noisy new boys are not mainstream. Where were the wild cat calls in the Winter Gardens so eagerly predicted by the Tory press? Instead there was applause. As things stand, the unions are in a surprisingly strong position - unless they play their present hand very badly indeed. Right now, public opinion is with them. Most people think Thatcher went too far in crushing them: the snarl of Tebbit is detested more than the bellow of Crow.   The Guardian ICM poll shows 59% think strikes in the public sector by rail, tube and council workers are justified. Tony Blair's praise for unions was well in tune with his focus groups, but he rightly warned them of losing that public support. His easy confidence in facing them comes from knowing what wiser old TUC heads also know: the public is fickle and they have suffered no real inconvenience yet. A one-day strike for the dinner ladies is heart-warmingly easy to support, but the country grinding to a halt soon sets public teeth grinding. The danger is not that Labour will be brought down again by the unions, but that if the unions answer the siren calls of Bob Crow et al, they will get mashed by Blair as soundly as they were squashed by Thatcher, because the thwack of firm government is what the voters would expect again if it came to serious disruption. So, as John Monks knew, it is partnership or carry on declining.   Physically the unions are weak, membership concentrated in the old not the new service occupations - 19% membership in the private sector and even in the public sector only 65%. However desperately needed unions are among the low-paid and down-trodden, the new recognition laws have only succeeded in slowing long-term decline. (There should be compulsory ballots in every non-unionised workplace, where organising can be next to impossible for casualised shift workers unsure of their rights.) But it is not on muscle, but on public opinion that unions rely for their real power. Crow and partners need that political lesson, since public alienation seems to be almost a strategy with them.   To succeed, unions need to capitalise skilfully on the general sympathy for public service staff who have fallen far behind and deserve much better. Yet at the same time they must be wary of polls that show 78% of voters fear the extra money for public services will be ""used up"" in pay instead of improvements. The council workers' victory was exemplary: they won, they got a long-term pay review and they kept public affection to fight another day.   But next up, the firefighters are in danger of overreaching themselves. This may be 9/11 we-love-firefighters week, but if train drivers and tube drivers come out in support of firefighters, avoiding the secondary action laws by claiming that running trains without firefighters is a safety issue, sympathy may wane.   Andy Gilchrist, the new Fire Brigades Union leader, is making a splash with a startling 40% demand - 40%! Many other trade union leaders roll their eyes and sigh. ""Hope Andy's got an exit strategy,"" says one, who is himself regarded as a radical - 40%! Some of the women trade unionists who helped organise the low-paid council workers strike spit with fury. ""Who do these willy-wavers think they are?"" said one, as her cooks, cleaners and carers settled for £5 an hour, less than half what firefighters get now, let alone another 40% on top. ""What makes them think a firefighter is worth so much more than a senior care assistant, breaking her back lifting old people all day, saving lives too and, frankly, working a darned sight harder. Firefighters are asleep half the bloody time they're on duty!"" On the record, the brothers' omerta means the TUC general council supported the firefighters nem con, but some shook their heads.   Well, has he got an exit strategy? There is still a long way to go before a possible strike at the end of October. There is plenty of room for compromise, so long as they don't paint themselves into a corner. Income Data Services, which monitors pay in all sectors, calculates that like all public servants, the FBU has indeed fallen far behind. To catch up with 1978, they need 21%. It is not impossible to imagine a phased deal that got them close. Both sides agree their skills have grown greatly, raising them up from manual workers to assistant professionals. Their present £21,531 is not a lot of money - though it is the median, so half the workforce earns even less. But 40%? If them, why not everyone?   The employers want a quid pro quo: a review of working practices as well as pay. But unlike the council workers, who welcomed it, the FBU refuses any review, especially not of their working practices. Emotional pleas about the danger - three die a year - may wear a bit thin among trawlermen and building trades with far higher death rates. Firefighters' jobs are sufficiently desirable so that almost alone among public workers, there is no shortage. Once the public focuses on all this, the firefighters may look a bit less loveable than they do this week. Blair's political education dates from 1979, hearing those famously disastrous words of the leader of the London ambulancemen: ""If it means lives must be lost, that is how it must be."" If the Fire Brigades Union or anyone else threatened anything like it now, they'd be seen off. Times have changed.   But both these strikes bring home the great public pay dilemma the government will have to face. The review of council workers' pay will stub its toe at once on ""comparability"". What is any worker worth? How do you value them? Easy to give points for training, for exams, for responsibility but allowing for these, they are all indispensable and it gets difficult.   Until now women's work has been downgraded simply because women do it with no rhyme or reason, only tradition - from teaching, social work and nursing to caring, cleaning and catering. Women's jobs will have to be revalued upwards. Then where do firefighters, who are compared now to the upper quartile of male manual pay, fit? (An FBU leader reputedly had a racehorse called Upper Quartile.) All need more, but women's pay cannot rise relatively unless some men's pay falls back, relatively. Awkward truth."
7,"At the turn of the year miserablism is in the air. Pessimism, disgust with everything, ennui, cynicism, all these are enemies of progress: thirst for improvement requires optimism and belief. Yet the desperate (and comical) disease of nostalgia for the past and distaste for the present is in danger of spreading from the dottier pages of the Telegraph and Mail into the blood stream of the nation.Nostalgia, usually a disability of the old, is infecting relatively young people too, as thirtysomethings bewail the mass culture of the moment as somehow more mass and more crass than it was. Where is ""authenticity"" the cry goes up, as people hunt in vain for things so rare no one else has found them. ""Decadence"" is all around. Everything is worse, values are gone, rudeness is rife, Britishness is in peril, the future is in the hands of fat kids fixated on PlayStations while bingeing yob culture rules and we're all going to hell in a handcart. (Which antique expression only shows how long people have thought society doomed.)Look at the recent strange crop of moral doom books, some on the bestseller lists. Is It Just Me, Or Is Everything Shit? The encyclopedia of modern life, by thirtysomethings Steve Lowe and Alan McArthur, blasts away with a splenetic nihilism at most of the things most people like best. Lynne Truss in her Talk to the Hand - The Utter Bloody Rudeness of the World Today, is funny and self-aware enough to know her diatribe is ahistorical, but what the hell, she slams into modernity with the same gleeful outrage. Utterly predictable is Digby Anderson's collection of his fellow Telegraph stable of effete moaners shaking their fists under the pompous title Decadence.Let's get one thing clear. This is the golden age - so far. There has never been a better time to be alive in Britain than today, no generation more blessed, never such opportunity for so many. And things are getting better all the time, horizons widening, education spreading, everyone living longer, healthier, safer lives. Unimaginable luxuries and choices are now standard - mobile phones sending pictures everywhere, accessing the universe on the internet and iPods with all the world's music in your ear. Barring calamity, there will be better. Acknowledging steady progress is the only way to prove what more could be done, if we tried harder.Decadence is an empty word, an emotional spasm over a feared falling away from some better era. A Latin word, the Romans felt themselves in perpetual decline from their own mythical beginnings. Plato bemoaned decline long before that. Drop into history anywhere and find this fear that people were once more civil and more civilised, usually at some time set just beyond living memory. In 1431 Christine de Pisan complained about the decline in manners in The City of Ladies. American universities teach a course in ""the rise in the culture of American rudeness"". This fear of things forever getting worse is irrational: for how can it always have been true? Since when, exactly?It is doubtful people really are ruder now. Different people may be rude in different ways. There was no more disgusting and vulgar rudeness than the way the upper and middle classes treated their battalions of servants in bygone times: see old diaries and novels passim. Nostalgia is unsurprisingly rare among those with any memory of working class roots. That is because nostalgia is almost always thinly disguised snobbery among those choosing to identify with the upper classes, longing for days when people knew their place, you could get good service and a huge underpaid class lived in dread of losing their job or failing to get a reference on the passing whim of the well-heeled if ever they answered back. Read Dickens to see if people were really nicer or politer. For decadence, look no further than the poisonous snobbery of ""polite society"" Edwardians. As for drunkenness, bingeing was OK for upper-class youth: read Evelyn Waugh.Is mass culture so deplorable? Shopping is the number one leisure activity - nothing wrong with that. A cornucopia of affordable pleasures invites the eye at Ikea. (It is mostly men who inveigh against retail therapy, but is sport any more elevating?) The self-defeating search for the ""authentic"" is just another kind of snobbery: nothing is worthwhile if everyone else can have it too. ""Authentic"" is as empty as ""decadent"", an inchoate, yearning word. What is inauthentic about wearing clothes someone designed for a chain store instead of for a ""designer"" shop? Nothing wrong with food from a supermarket, those modern miracles of splendour and choice: the old corner shop selling beans, Oxo and white sliced died because it was worse. Meanwhile, more people listen to classical music, buy books and attend blockbuster art exhibitions than ever before. Culture high and low was never more accessible and it thrives. Television was never better either: memory compresses the good bits. As for pop music, we aficionados of Radio 2's Sounds of the Sixties with yer old mate Brian Matthew (Saturdays 8-10am) are weekly reminded of the excruciating dross that rubbed up alongside the greats. It is human to miss things fondly remembered from youth, but it is folly to imagine those things necessarily ""better"".This disease breaks out in a virulent rash at certain times. Why now? If this year was the worst it gets economically, with only a minor lessening in 10 years of unbroken good growth, maybe there is a vertiginous sense that such a run of good fortune can't last. Or maybe affluence brings with it other expectations: it allows the great ""what's it all for?"" to loom.There is plenty to be angry about: poverty, ignorance, helplessness, social injustice, environmental depredation (or the walloping million-pound bonuses paid to City bankers in this bad year). The progressive endeavour is to persuade people to want and believe things can always get better and fairer. What has been dismal since the election is Labour's failure to raise those hopes: instead it has swum with the tide of gloom, demanding ""respect"" from those who receive none themselves. More children stay on at school and achieve, but Labour echoes the mood of the moment - things are worse, youth is worse with much to fear and little to celebrate. Tony Blair's lack of inspirational leadership may now be bizarrely exposed by the Conservatives as Cameron overtakes on the inside, claiming climate change, redistribution and Africa. (It won't last: wait until Bob Geldof and Zac Goldsmith demand things no Tory party could agree.)But Cameron's clever artifice has rightly identified the great lacuna in Blair's leadership: Blair has triangulated away the big issues that engage the heart, while deliberately hiding the redistributive good Labour has done. This current phoney mood that yearns for yesterday is partly a longing for things Blair has always avoided. People - or at least enough of them - enjoy affluence but they want to be asked for altruism too. Craven politicians offering only better management demand nothing noble of the voter. The ""better yesterday"" syndrome is partly a symptom of Labour's lack of much vision for better tomorrows. New year needs new resolutions from Labour."
7,"The smell of death around this government is so overpowering it seems to have anaesthetised them all. One bungle follows another and yet those about to die sit silently by. So is that it - the great September relaunch, the great economic recovery plan? The problem is not lack of substance but absurdly grandiose expectations, raised mostly by briefings from No10 suggesting that there were magic answers. The ineptitude of Brown's Downing Street worsens by the week. The shrinking band of those he trusts are now his old rottweilers, who shred what's left of their leader's reputation. This week when they mauled Alistair Darling for telling an obvious truth (his actual words much exaggerated in the reporting), they attacked one of Brown's few truly loyal friends and a decent man. This is the sign of an inner cabal out of control. Brown apparently denies he orders these attacks on others, but fails to sack those who carry them out. The latest disaster is Downing Street's mishandling of a windfall tax on energy companies. The idea was allowed to run until the last moment, suggesting &pound;1bn of unearned profits might be taken to ease the pain of the poorest. Downing Street started the talk of issuing energy vouchers to the needy, and only days ago denied the idea was dead. When Compass, the left-of-centre pressure group, gathered a great popular petition in support of it, endorsed by 122 MPs, several parliamentary private secretaries and, privately, many ministers, it looked like pushing at an open door. After all, Brown himself was the architect of that &pound;5bn windfall on the utilities. So it was a needless shock when the prime minister told the Scottish CBI that windfalls were ""short-term gimmicks and giveaways"". Instead, the energy companies will next week spend a lot less than that &pound;1bn on lagging lofts and insulating windows. Of course energy saving is essential - but it will get few of the vulnerable through this winter. As talks continue, the government now negotiates like a highwayman without a gun. What's to negotiate? It was not the left, but the Conservative-run Local Government Association that exposed the big six energy companies for giving shareholders a 20% dividend increase. Now there will be a stormy Labour conference as Compass and the unions prepare an emergency motion. The winter death figures will be watched by Brown's enemies: fairly or not, any extra old-and-cold deaths will be laid at his door. All this was so avoidable. In both the housing and fuel plans, no clear principle was spelled out. Brown should have said the government will not, and cannot, stop house prices falling. The stamp duty holiday is a bad mistake - all too characteristic of the prime minister. It's an expensive way to entice first-time buyers into negative equity, as all predictions are of  steeper falls in house price. That money - maybe &pound;600m - would be much better spent letting councils buy homes to keep a roof over the heads of families whose own homes have been repossessed - and buying cheap properties for social housing. But again, Brown yearns for that ""tax cut"" headline. Again he cuts a good tax on property as he did in income tax, while letting unfair purchase taxes hit the poorest hardest. A windfall tax was a chance not only to relieve the hard-pressed, but to signal some recompense for a decade of wealth trickling upwards. Charles Clarke's call for Brown's head was met by resounding silence this week, making it look less a clarion call than a lonely trumpeting of the Last Post. But it may come to be seen as the opening assassination salvo. The danger is it will be a painfully slow-motion stabbing, too late to make much difference. A cabinet of minnows and spineless backbenchers include many - perhaps most - who want Brown gone, but lack the nerve to act. They wait for someone else, for Brown to walk away or for a proverbial bus to save them from the task. First they put it off in July: wait until after the summer, many said. Now it's wait until the party conference - as if that ""speech of a lifetime"" could make a scrap of difference at this stage. Then it will be ""Don't rock the boat before the Glenrothes byelection"". Will that deliver the electric shock to end the inertia that neither Crewe nor Glasgow East could? Or will they put it off until after Christmas, or catastrophic May elections? Some say a recession is no time for internal wrangling; but the longer they leave it, the longer the leadership question hangs over them. It will not go away. Soon Cameron's lead will be gold-plated, his succession virtually inevitable. Another year effectively unchallenged by Labour, his contradictions and vacuities unridiculed and unexposed, will gift him an almost unopposed victory. Already at conferences the lobby groups and voluntary organisations hang on every word of shadow ministers, yawning through mere ministers on their way out. Already power, money, glamour, foreign interest and attention flock to Cameron in a political tide whose undertow knocks Labour off its feet with every wave. Stoking up fear of some fictitious Blairite coup is the Brown camp's trump card. They spook the unions with warnings that privatisers, tax-cutters and wealth-worshippers will take over if Brown is unseated. Personal rivalries - as between David Miliband and Ed Balls - are falsely dressed up as second-generation Brown/Blair battles. But this is all costume drama, wearing the political clothes of yesterday. The imaginary Blair/Brown ideological distinction has now been exposed as the sham it always was. Brown used to let it be known he opposed university fees, war, ID cards, Trident, foundation hospitals and a host of other things he now supports. The 10p tax band abolition to bribe the better off was a wickedness entirely of his own devising. Letting rip the disastrous house price boom was him, as was letting top earnings soar unchecked while reckless banks had ""light-touch regulation"" and public sector workers were pinned to below-inflation pay. The sad truth is that he opposed Blair, not Blair policies. So why would unions save his skin now? As the TUC gathers this weekend, they should consider that whoever was to stand as leader, they could win an election in the Labour party only with a radical new agenda. Unseating a prime minister is very high risk - but a dying party should be ready to take dangerous medicine if that's the last chance left."
7,"New Year and the flying prime minister falls back to earth in Westminster. Now in the cold grey light of dismal January, Labour's second term begins in earnest. A tottering in-tray awaits, with transport at the top, the NHS just beneath and a score of pressing questions awaiting answers. As he examines the pile of paper, where is his route map through it all? What is his guiding principle? The old answer, what works, does not take him far when high profile bits of it are patently not working well.  As the fog starts to clear, however, some new governing principles emerge, at the instigation and certainly with the approval of the prime minister himself. Rumblings of change are in the air. To left-of-centre critics Tony Blair used to say, tapping the side of his nose, ""Wait for the second term. Mrs Thatcher didn't discover Thatcherism until well into hers."" But disappointingly, the first months after a lack-lustre election ambled along in directionless confusion, saved only by September 11. It is since then that there have been startling changes of direction.   Somewhere on his desk Tony Blair will come across Where Now for New Labour? by Anthony Giddens (published this week by the Fabians, the Policy Network and Polity Press). He will find it interesting reading, not because it gives him the answer to the question it poses. Quite the contrary. Inadvertently, it shows how far the government has   already travelled since 1997. Five years is a very long time in politics. The world has moved on since the heyday of the third way, but its progenitor, Professor Giddens, is now urging Blair to slam on the brakes.   Giddens was a founding father of New Labour: his 1994 book Beyond Left and Right shaped the third way path to victory. Drawing on Clinton's triumphant rebranding of the Democrats, he erected Tony Blair's big tent, stealing the Conservatives' prime turf. The third way was a beacon for left-of-centre parties around Europe. All had similar baggage to shed - heavy-handed statism, trade union producer interests and inflexibility in the face of new problems. The third way was a magic carpet for transporting the left into power: not tax and spend, not soft on crime, not hostile to business. It buried old ghosts and Giddens deserves much of the credit. It generated wide support, but its neutral message never struck deep roots.   Now Giddens is warning against any departure from those original winning mantras - most of all on tax and spend. He attacks Gordon Brown's plans to raise tax to pay for public services. Denouncing ""the myth of taxation"", he describes how more money flows into the Treasury through the fruits of high employment and economic success than through raising tax rates. Raising rates to 50% for those earning over £100,000 would only bring in £3bn (actually a considerable sum). He points out that the top 1% of   earners already contribute 20% of all income tax - an interesting fact.   But stop and contemplate what it really reveals: the rich are not taxed through the nose, but they earn staggering sums of money compared to the rest. This thought, though, is illegitimate in third way thinking. Third wayers are never jealous of success. Third wayers believe in equality of opportunity: redistribution is only to pull the very poorest over the poverty threshold.    Giddens's vision of a successful economy relies on large numbers in minimum wage jobs. Britain's employment record is better than most of Europe because of easy access to flexible, low-paid work. He does say that there needs to be more in-work training to help these people up ladders (currently few ever climb out of marginal work). True, people are better off in work but while a third of people, in and out of work, live beneath what most people regard as a decent standard of living, that does require any social democrat to consider the depth of British inequality.   Somewhere at the heart of the third way was a fundamental unwillingness to face   this unpalatable fact. While Giddens rightly attacks the old left for its mindless refusal to give the government credit for anything, he is himself too dismissive of other European countries' social polices that deliver fairer societies.   Third way orthodoxy does not address an electorate now less tax-phobic than angry about public services. But Giddens sees the voter as an immutable beast: everything ""must fall within the bounds of what is electorally feasible"" as if leaders never shift the political climate. Yet those who voted for Thatcherism in election after election are not the same people who voted Blair back last year: people change, reacting to past errors, pursuing new goals. When Mrs Thatcher in her first budget cut top rates of income tax by a swingeing 38%, she knew the power of political symbolism. Sending out strong signals and sweeping the people along in her train, she changed the national mood in ways third wayers never dared try.   That is why the third way is history. The government is daring to try. Third way bounds are everywhere being burst at last as Labour begins to believe in the reality of its own power. The tax taboo is broken, cannabis decriminalised, student fees rethought, gross fat cat salaries at least a little checked by shareholder votes, art galleries and museums free, Railtrack turned into a non-profit company, asylum seekers vouchers rescinded.   None of these is an act of outrageous radicalism but all were once so unthinkable   that any minister whispering the words was forced to humiliating public apology. The ice is cracking and in the thaw ministers are starting to think for themselves. Those who do so most, like Charles Clarke, are emerging as the winners over clones still mouthing dead mantras. Originality pays because ministers need to think aloud about serious problems.   What is the emerging story? Good government was what New Labour promised, non-ideological, technocratic, what works. That is developing now into something more coherent: government is good. To make the case for higher taxes and better services, that key idea needs to lead the way. The market delivers prosperity best, the voluntary sector can refresh and inspire around the margins, but in the end the goods that only government can deliver are what everyone wants now. Well-managed and efficient, always room for improvement, public service is indispensable and precious. These are still only the green shoots of an ideology that profoundly divides right from left - but once it was a third way taboo.   So as the PM ploughs through his in-tray he has an emerging progressive idea for the next decisions he must take. The third way was Bill Clinton's emblem - an election winner that left a tragically empty legacy: there is no ""Clintonism"". Blairism already deserves a place in the dictionary for his global vision: now he has to establish its meaning at home."
7,"It was a bravura performance - it almost always is. With eloquence, reason and deftness of foot, the prime minister silenced the war wobblers - at least for now. Many remain queasily uneasy, crossing their fingers that Saddam sees sense in time: yesterday's unsurprising dossier changed few people's risk assessments of war. Yet whatever their doubts, both cabinet and loyalist MPs were forced by their leader's inexorable logic to nod in assent at each stepping stone towards (probable) war. Does the UN and international law matter? (Nods all round.) Is all law worthless unless backed by the might to enforce it? (Nods again.) Is there any point in threatening force if the UN does not mean to use it? (No, of course not.) Did diplomacy unbacked by threat of force ever bring dictator down? (Heads shake.) Would failure to enforce UN resolutions tell all dictators they could flout the law with impunity? (Yes, indeed.) And so the path to perdition may be papered with the purest logic, sanctioned by the highest law and blessed with thoroughly noble sentiments - yet still be a dangerously misguided act.  Outside America and No 10 there are precious few leaders (and even fewer of their peoples) who sincerely believe that an attack on Iraq is wise. But the combination of Bush's hegemonic will and barrister Blair's legal and moral logic drive on remorselessly. When is the right time to talk of due proportion and prudence? When does the inexorable   logic pause to ask which risk is worse - war or continued no-fly containment? Where is the evidence that Saddam will use these weapons, while thus contained?  Though White House hawks at first refused to go to the UN, now the UN emerges as the trap forcing the world to threaten war in the name of its own credibility. If Saddam miscalculates and invites attack, then who can pull back from a logic they have nodded through? The problem for MPs yesterday, and for the rest of the world at the UN, is that once the threat is made it can never be withdrawn. This sabre-rattling phase was not the right time for parliament to hold this debate, when every reasonable person wants to show Saddam that he must comply. Yet it might be the only time to challenge the ""logic"" of all this.  Tony Blair was at pains this week to stress the difference between his fundamental beliefs and those of George Bush. Careful to breathe nothing but respect for the president himself, there is much eyerolling dismissal of the hawks about him. Despite the humiliating master/lackey surface, there are two quite different doctrines at work. The Bush doctrine published last week in his new national security strategy lays out the nature of US power in remarkably bald terms. Scant diplomacy bothered to mask its brash self-interest. It outlines an unfettered ""distinctly American internationalism"" ready to act unilaterally when it wants. Asserting a US right to pre-emptive attack against any hostile state, it offers a   recipe for global mayhem on every disputed border. Above all the Bush doctrine promises that never again will any other nation rival American might, whatever it takes to keep it that way. This is America's first genuine post-cold war doctrine, daring to trumpet its monumental unfettered power.  The Blair doctrine, as befits a mini-power lacking brute force, instead summons up a mighty moral imperative. First propounded in Chicago when urging Clinton to rescue the Kosovans, all this week Blair has expounded it to all doubters. Yes, he would intervene anywhere, any time to depose tyrants and free victims. In Zimbabwe, if he could. In North Korea. In the mullahocracy of Iran, maybe: the half world still living without democracy is potentially on his list. It is an admirable ambition, casting away the cynical old Kissinger doctrine that wheeled and dealed with any tyrant so long as he was useful, letting sleeping monsters lie so long as they were our monster, South Africa included.  The Blair doctrine also arises from seizing a new post-cold war chance. What need stop the onward march of liberation from tyranny now? The trouble with his   doctrine is that it lacks reality. To topple the Taliban, a multitude of filthy regimes had to be paid, strengthened and appeased - in my view, worth the result. To invade Iraq again requires abetting regimes as bad on the Blair moral index. He has been right three times - Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan - and he might be right now; or else Iraq could bring his doctrine crashing to earth. (And his political career with it.)  There was another great awakening from the cold war this week when Gerhard Schrder won by breaking all the old rules of European diplomacy. Sensing not only among his own voters, but right across Europe, a significant groundswell of anti-Americanism since Bush took power, he severed an umbilical cord with the US. At a stroke Germany's war guilt, Germany's gratitude for the Marshall plan, plus German reliance on US defence in Nato was forgotten. Whatever reconciliation is patched together, overnight Schrder shattered a European taboo: others may now find it easier to turn away from an America whose present regime is abhorrent to an essentially social democratic continent. Schrder's desperate electioneering ploy may start a surprising new spirit of European independence. That would trigger an angry US review of Nato, forcing the EU to forge a useful common defence capability and a more united foreign policy. Is that over-optimistic, since Blair   and Schrder's positions could hardly diverge further at this moment? Blair may have yet again lost an opportunity for leadership in Europe, with even Al Gore standing to his left on this.  Unease is everywhere, among senior EU figures and politicians all across Europe, reflected in newspaper editorials of many political hues. They watch the Dow Jones and FTSE falling through the floor as war looks likely, hurtling the world towards recession. They see oil prices rising whenever war is mentioned. Labour is falling in the polls.  Serious talk in many corridors of power considers the suitcases of horror waiting under unknown beds to be unleashed in US and EU cities the day Saddam falls: no one doubts the dossier's descriptions of what he has, only his likelihood of using it except in his death throes. He is well enough contained currently in his no-fly zone. Igniting Arab outrage, inciting worse terror, uniting enemies against the aggressor with dominoes of states falling to fundamentalist rebellion: all are logical fears, but they seem like mere self-interested cowardice under the blazing moral light of the Blair doctrine.  The puzzle is Tony Blair's uncharacteristic recklessness abroad, risking his own career, his support at the polls and much else. How brave he is over the moral certainties of distant war; how over-cautious, by comparison, he has often been over familiar dilemmas at home."
7,"Wearily, I am dusting down some old files long relegated to ancient history. Can it really be that the case for some basic women's rights has to be made all over again? On abortion, on nurseries and the right to combine work and motherhood, backlash is in the air - some of it from surprising quarters. So old battles need to be fought again, arguments re-made from first principles. Some of this was territory only grudgingly won at the time: old enemies have lurked in the bushes ever since. On abortion, the Catholics and the pro-lifers never went away and now they are joined by evangelicals and Muslims. The far left that once supported women's rights and gay rights now flirts with Muslim fundamentalists instead: Peter Tatchell is the best exposer of such hypocrisy and double-think.  On the right, despite opinion polls' strong support for the 1967 abortion law, their press is filled with juicy anti-abortion horror stories to kindle fear and guilt in every young woman's heart. The Mail and Telegraph have stepped up their campaign of late with a spate of grizzly shockers. New hi-tech pictures of 12 week old foetuses have had the pro-lifers calling for abortion limits at 12 weeks. Lurid but unsubstantiated reports of half-alive aborted foetuses aid their arguments, about the 23-week ""foetus"" aborted in one room, while a 23-week-old ""baby"" is saved next door. (Never mind the alarmingly high number of tiny scraps kept alive so young who are severely disabled.)  The real harm done is to vulnerable young girls shocked by these images. With sex education still only a mandatory part of the curriculum as basic science, Britain remains the west European country with the highest teenage pregnancy rate. New Rowntree Foundation research shows the rate of pregnant young girls opting for abortion varies hugely according to social class: nearly 80% of pregnant girls in the highest social classes choose abortion, compared with only 18% among those with low expectations of life.  So David Steel's intervention was a shock, suggesting another cut in his own 1967 abortion law time limit. Originally 28 weeks, it was reduced to 24 weeks in 1990. Now he wants it cut to 22 weeks.  It is not the age of the foetus that counts: it is the right of the mother not to bear an unwanted child. Wait for it, any day now an MP will put up a private member's bill and there will be pressure for the government to give it time.  Cutting the time limit may seem reasonable to some - but consider the desperate late cases: the youngest or most helpless in a state of denial; menopausal women who never realised until too late; or women deserted by partners at the last moment. Whatever the reason, it should be enough that a woman does not want a child. How dare the state force them? How dare anyone judge them? If the debate re-opens, then let's fight back for walk-in clinics for any woman, no questions asked.  So who still thinks this is a post-feminist era? The battles are not won, the revolution is only half-made. Young middle-class high-fliers becoming mothers are often stunned to find that they still can't have it all: it is unbearable to compete with the men's manic working hours. Combining careers and babies is almost as hard as ever. With no collective movement or feminist explanation to hand, they struggle alone. They imagine previous generations must have somehow worried less about their babies, hardened their hearts. The modern post-feminists are, above all, class-blind in their views, knowing little or nothing of what happens in other social classes where matters are far worse. Poor women are obliged to work with terrible arrangements for their children. For them, back to work as soon as their paid leave is over, the tricky choice between nanny, child minder or nursery is something only to dream of.  Women's anxieties are easily stirred, stricken with guilt by any passing piece of research suggesting marginal ill-effects of leaving their children while they work. (Edward Melhuish, co-author of the recent study that caused such a stir, says no harm was found in children as long as they didn't go to nurseries under one year old.) But the backlash against nurseries has only just begun - before they even exist for the great majority of families. As the Tories and their press scratch around for any excuse to cut the expensive Sure Start children's centre programme, expect much more hyping of any research they can find - even if it was done mainly on alarmingly low-quality US nurseries where Workfare has forced poor mothers to dump their babies or starve. Nurseries are - and always will be - a choice: no government in the foreseeable future dare try the cruelty of Workfare compulsion here. With universal Sure Start nurseries now promised, the next step is one year's paid maternity leave and the right for any job to become part-time.  Other threats loom, such as the aggressive fathers' rights movement. Read their house magazine McKenzie to see the depth of their misogyny and desire for revenge against women. They are right that mothers should be forced to comply with access orders. But Michael Howard, grasping at any passing hot cause, wants courts to grant automatic equal rights to fathers. However, children are not chattels: ask King Solomon. Courts must always put the   child's interests first. Until some distant day when fathers do as much childcare as mothers, most children will choose the one who has nurtured them most.  As ever with women's rights, men get their backlash in first. They were slamming doors in women's faces to give them a taste of ""women's lib"" before women ever gained a shred more equality. Here we go again: you want men to do more childcare? Then give fathers rights before they've earned them. Having followed up some fathers' cases, many of the angriest turn out to be wife-beaters. Few had shown previous interest in childcare, many failed to show up for access visits and other only asserted rights in retaliation for CSA maintenance demands.  These are straws in the wind, but they all need challenging, one by one. There is no woman's movement to pull together these strands, but it is needed as much as ever. The pay gap still yawns too wide for most women to be breadwinners for their families. Domestic violence and the failure of rape cases is only now getting political attention, due to Harriet Harman. Motherhood is only now starting to get the help it needs from the state, thanks to Margaret Hodge. Women make up the great majority of the poor, from motherhood through to old age. So in next week's expected reshuffle, the cabinet had better be filled with women determined to put this right."
7,"Choice? What choice? The residents of Clapham Park Estate might be asking themselves that as they head off to the polls within a couple of weeks. People who live in what was judged Lambeth's worst housing estate will be voting on whether to transfer their homes from Lambeth council to a new community-led housing association. Since 1997, 142 estates have voted yes in housing-transfer votes, while only 25 have voted no. A wise decision, since this is a gun-to-the-head choice.  Here's what confronts them: vote yes and in exchange for selling off some land you get your estate repaired and large parts of it rebuilt with new homes with larger rooms, a new park, new play areas, a new school and improvements all round - or else. Else what? Nothing, or almost nothing.   If they vote no, eventually the estate will be repaired to the standards of the government's ""decent homes"" target - but that is a pretty basic improvement. In most of Clapham Park, a decent homes makeover would mean hardly more than a bit of damp-proofing and a lick of paint, and perhaps not for years. It would not include central heating, insulation, new kitchens or bathrooms, entry phones on front doors or lifts - all of which will be provided under the stock transfer plan if they vote yes.   So where is the choice? A gleaming refurbished estate with lots of new housing and an extra 225 social homes, or carrying on much the same? It's a no-brainer: opinion poll samples taken so far suggest the residents will vote for the change. And yet now that can't be taken for granted.   Over the last years, I have been observing meetings where the plans have been drawn up with tenants in the driving seat of the board that runs the estate. There have been extensive consultations and public meetings. But at the last moment, the Defend Council Housing group has moved to mount a campaign for a no vote. A war of leaflets and meetings has broken out. Insults are flying to and fro, roughly translated as ""a bunch of Trots"" versus ""a bunch of pocket-liners bent on doing down the tenants for profit"". This is typical of the pattern of the debate that has raged over these ballots.   Defend Council Housing is wrong on this stock transfer. And they are very wrong to frighten tenants with - to put it politely - misleading stories about what the plan will mean. They have been telling tenants that they will lose their security of tenure (false: it will get written back in) and that they will pay higher rents (false: true in the past but Labour has put council and housing association rents on a par, by law). Worst of all is the charge that they will be permanently decanted but no one knows to where. This last is the most powerful fear. But tenants have been given a firm guarantee that they can all stay on exactly the same part of the rebuilt estate, which is strongly divided between the east and west sides. (A false rumour said all the social housing was to be squeezed into the east, while the lush west would be new, private homes).   What makes these ideological battles hard is that, despite its fear-mongering tactics, many agree that Defend Council Housing is not altogether wrong. This government keeps boasting about giving choice to public-service users - but choice, it seems, does not extend to council tenants. Alan Milburn uses the council estate of his youth as an example of the need for choice, recalling how the council painted all the doors the same colour, but the tenants' right to choose their landlord is rather more important than door colour.   Local authorities only transfer homes to housing associations because of Treasury rules and political dogma allowing housing associations but not councils to borrow money on future development. A stroke of the pen could let councils do likewise. However, now is no time to tamper with how the public sector borrowing requirement is calculated, in the middle of an election fought over a so-called ""black hole"" in government finances.   Stock transfer opponents are right to object to selling off council-owned land for private development, when expensive land in the south-east is needed for more social and key-worker homes in London. Lambeth, which is short of school places, already regrets sales of old schools converted into loft apartments.   So how should the tenants on Clapham Park vote? The danger is that some will be swayed by scare tactics and false rumours spread by the anti campaign. People are easily frightened and a tenancy can feel precarious: this is their home, their neighbours, their future.   However, in weighing it up, Lambeth council tenants know they have had nothing to be grateful for in the past 30 years from a council landlord who has mismanaged and neglected them and is still deep in debt. When Camden tenants voted against stock transfer, they wanted to stay with a beacon council with an ""excellent"" rating as a landlord: but voting no left them stranded without new money. Housing experts say the government should give the best councils the same powers as housing associations. But Lambeth is no Camden.   This vote matters more here: it is a vote of confidence in the residents themselves, who have been helping to run the estate for the past five years. Clapham Park is one of the 39 New Deal for Communities (NDCs) - a remarkable experiment in handing more power to tenants elected to   chair and sit on the board that runs it. It is they who oversaw the masterplan. Given £56m to spend over 10 years, NDCs are one of Labour's most radical regeneration ideas, closely monitored, a regeneration testbed for all kinds of social enterprise, and their success matters.   So when Defend Council Housing puts out leaflets claiming ""Regeneration isn't about our needs, it's about other people making money out of our misery"", it is a direct attack on Clapham Park residents elected by other residents. This is no place to play out politics.   The management board of local tenants gives up a phenomenal amount of unpaid time and has done well, hitting most targets for improvement. New community support officers patrol the estate, scores of crack houses have been closed, prostitution is less aggressive, there are CCTV cameras in the worst zones, crime is down and the number of residents feeling unsafe after dark has dropped from 78% to 43%. After paying for extra teachers for schools and after-school clubs, exam results have improved - above target in English, despite the many non-English speakers.   There may be too little choice in how to vote, but Clapham Park residents should block their ears to those who tell them that their own elected New Deal board has done anything but what's best in drawing up this plan. Defend Council Housing's campaign of fear could put it all at risk: it has already left many estates without a future after a no vote. It should argue this out with the national politicians, not jeopardise the best chances of local people."
7,"As the light of the world Al Gore is not much to look at. He's a poor fish, lugubrious and somnolent. His minders goad him into flapping his fins a bit but there is no spark in his fishy eye. However, physiognomy and charm aren't everything. Yet again liberal America will have to make do with an imperfect candidate. But contemplating the threat of a George W Bush victory, their man starts to seem prime presidential material. Al Gore is all there is and the fate of the world now depends on his success. Observing him perform at close quarters, he does not, alas, improve: television soundbites flatter him. Plodding painfully in a speech to the Irish American Forum in Manhatten, he read monotonously through a respectable enough detailed commitment to the peace process - ""I've been studying up on it"" - and he had, he had. (He is a slow but thorough study.) European ears have to screen out the yuck in all American electioneering: it's a foreign language to us. Maybe it's to Al Gore's credit that he is so bad at it that the whole room winces when he tries the down home stuff: ""Tipper and I have just become grandparents. Any other grandparents here? Let's see those hands! Great. Give me some lessons, I'm just a rookie!""  There's none of that Clinton magic, intelligence and warmth that could win over the coldest audience. But if he lacks Clinton's skills, he also lacks his faults. All his life, this senator's son has been groomed for this moment, mainly by his mother who looked just like him standing behind him on the platform as he celebrated Super Tuesday's results. He has rarely put a foot wrong, never done anything to excess, wore a tie every day as a young journalist and never drank a beer on duty. He is a manufactured man who sometimes over-boasts his achievements (no he didn't invent the internet, though he was the first senator to promote it).  Those who knew him young say all danger and therefore all character was nipped at his mother's breast. His minders try to humanise him by revealing that he doesn't wear pyjamas. Because of Clinton, this election will turn on ""character"": if that's just keeping his trousers on and no skeletons, Al Gore's their man. Bush tries to tar Gore with Clinton's sins. ""This is the end of the Clinton/Gore era!"" he keeps shouting but it won't stick. Every day that passes Al Gore looks more like his own man.   The important question is what has he learned from the Clinton era? As it draws to a close Tony Blair, who took so much from Clinton's third way, must also be asking what went wrong. How with so little achieved? Clinton, could have moved mountains with a golden economy and his powers of persuasion, but he didn't.  Long before Lewinsky, Clinton lost his daring, tenacity and vision. True the checks and balances of the US constitution stymied him at every turn, but that was only part of the story. After the great disaster of his failed health reforms, he rarely tried again to do anything bold. All was compromise. His third way meant ducking tough choices, appeasing and eschewing ideology until he was left with none. He could always spin a mean speech, but fine words were a substitute for action. Tony Blair risks the same fatal loss of momentum. Clinton's hyper-caution stopped him rushing the citadels of conservatism while the force was still with him. Has Gore learned? Might he surprise us yet with a daring belied by his stolid dullness?  It's encouraging that so far Al Gore's television ads have never trimmed to the right. Night after night he has pumped out a strong liberal message - pro choice on abortion, pro gun control, pro health care for the poor, universal health care for children. Bush is stranded too far out on the right, lost somewhere on the Bob Jones campus and he struggles to get back towards the centre. But so far the signs are that Gore will stay firmly where he is and hold to his message, which is a very good one.  With his strong pitch on radically reforming campaign finance, he takes on the McCain mantle. He's earned unusual respect in that much mocked role as vice-president by beavering away at technology, the environment, education and foreign policy (He was more in favour of intervening in the Bosnian tragedy than Clinton.) A policy wonk by nature, he likes the nitty-gritty which is no bad thing. And he assembles good advisers.  So even if he sets no hearts afire, even if his every move is stiffly calculated, he'll do. George W Bush will make this the dirtiest, most vitriolic campaign ever fought. The rest of the world will look on, as usual, aghast at the spectacle of how the world's great guarantor of democracy conducts its own elections. We will watch every twist and turn in the terrible process with bated breath because so much hangs in its balance. On the vagaries of ever-diminishing numbers of US voters dimly informed by mendacious 30-second commercials too much depends. Those who fear any move towards more global governance should consider how already the future of so many countries rests to a large degree on the outcome of something over which we outsiders have no control at all - this great rambunctious, mendacious, shameless four-yearly extravaganza in America.  In a Bush victory there is the prospect of an isolationist America, wastefully   rearming with useless hi-tech weapons while reneging on international disarmament treaties and dangerously rousing the Zhirinovsky tendency in Russia. Republican refusal to play the global policeman will demolish America's new-found sense of responsibility for universal human rights. The outlook for the UN would be grim in that changed atmosphere. World free trade would become a worse battle ground for naked US interest, risking large parts of the global economy and thus ultimately America's own. An already shameful refusal to accept heavy responsibility for global warming or to make sacrifices in energy use would be even worse under a Texas oilman who uses cheap energy as one of his campaign themes.  On all these questions Al Gore says the right thing. What would or could he do?   As with Clinton or with Blair, there is little doubt about where all their true convictions lie. In the end what matters is a leader's skill, bravery and determination to deliver, unknowable until too late.  It's neck and neck now with Gore in the lead but a long run-in to November. If he loses it will be the death of a key part of the Blair project too - that pivotal link between social democratic Europe and a Democrat in the White House. No more third way in foreign policy. Blair will be obliged to turn back towards a Europe that is culturally so very much more like us: America never seems more alien than at election time, fascinating but monstrous too."
7,"The disgusting behaviour of Premier League footballers has shocked the nation, miring the beautiful game in lust and lucre. Greed exceeds goals, obscene cash breeds obscene behaviour. ""Who the HELL do you think you are?"" screams the Mirror's front page, joining the outrage at these jumped-up boys from nowhere with money to burn. As for the Sun - ""You Failed Us"" - it was Murdoch who corrupted the game with all this cash. Hypocrisy knows no bounds. But what is all this really about? Leave aside the specific allegations of rape in two incidents where the law will take its course (despite the lynch mob's ready-made verdict). Await judgment on lurid tales of ""roasting"" young groupies, a story bought for £10,000 by the News of the World from a ""party organiser"" now himself arrested. At least ask why Rio Ferdinand has been quite so monstered. The other footballers may protest at his treatment, but for once the ""spoiled brats"" showed some solidarity. After Ferdinand's no-show at a drugs test, ""he was entitled to confidentiality and a fair hearing"", read their not unreasonable statement. We shall see when those who have broken laws or FA rules are duly tried. Meanwhile, something else is going on here.  Alarm bells should ring whenever the nation - as voiced by the press - is in moral panic mode. Moral panic is when some serious crime is allowed to bleed over from the particular to the general. Moral panic is a slippery elision between a horrible event and the idea that it represents the tip of some unknown iceberg of moral collapse. The murder of James Bulger is the paradigm, when a bizarrely horrible crime tipped the nation into cataclysmic panic about modern parenting and wild children. In that hysterical mood, Michael Howard yelled ""Prison works!"" and prison numbers have soared ever since.  So let us assume some footballers have been behaving badly, criminally or are even vicious rapists. What fires this furore goes far beyond these particular events. Take this comment on the radio from Brian Glanville, the distinguished football commentator: ""I think many black players - in many cases, particularly with young West Indian players - they come from a society in which families are so often fatherless, mothers have to work, children are left all day in the care of minders. They have very little education and then suddenly these uneducated boys are projected into a world in which they are earning, say, £40,000, £50,000 a week. There are no controls.""  Foolishly, Glanville may have said a   little too boldly what the leader-writers and all the rest have been saying in code. Oiks from council estates - especially black oiks - are all being paid too much. Even more than you or I in the well-paid commentariat, for God's sake!  There is no moral panic, only disapproval, when grossly moneyed oiks from the upper classes behave badly: Prince Harry, Lord Frederick Windsor, Tom Parker-Bowles, the Marquis of Blandford or Flaming Ferrari James Archer. Glanville blames footballers' lack of education, but no one blames Eton for its failure to impart one iota of intellect or civilisation into some of its yobs, which might see other schools put on special measures. And unlike with footballers, no one ever suggests that the coke-snorting, rampaging toff yobs have too much money. Or that their whole social class should have their unearned incomes confiscated for failing to act as role models to the less fortunate.  This is all about values and the lack of them. Politicians enjoy talking about their ""values"" in the abstract, but through all three tedious party conferences not a word from the platform was spoken about actual value - in hard cash. What are people worth? Why are they paid what they are? What should be done about obscene pay increases soaring away at the top, while the greatest number of the poor are now in work and earning less than a living wage? This growing fissure is leading to fracturing of pay scales and a new greed at the top that is infecting the public sector too.  While politicians fiddle with marginal questions, economic history will show that failure to take action on this widening chasm was the social disaster of our age. While unbridled greed goes unreproved and untaxed, the public message is that greed is good. It poisons everything, makes collective provision of public services almost impossible, fosters paranoia that others are getting more gravy and breaks the kind of social cohesiveness David Blunkett hammers on about. What chance of building ""civil society"" in a devil-take-the-hindmost pay structure the politicians dare not even mention?  At least footballers, like rock stars, earn their money in a genuine market. Every time they run out, they have to prove their cash value with their feet. Now compare that with the latest figures for company directors, published today by Income Data Services.  Over the last decade, directors of FTSE-100 companies have seen their incomes rise at six times the rate of other employees. What's more, in this bad year directors in the top 350 FTSE companies had an average increase of 12.9%. Median earnings for top executives is now £1.33m. What for? No one knows. They may or many not do a good job. Their company's success or failure may or may not be down to them. One thing is certain - if there were a referendum on whether they deserve so much, the answer would be a resounding negative. But not a word   about raising top tax even a smidgeon passes Labour's lips, nor a word about dysfunctional payscales and its deleterious effect on productivity.  Here is the moral question politicians duck. Shouldn't there be at least a national conversation about who is worth what and why? Why pick on the golden feet of footballers, just because they came up the hard way? Deserving and undeserving are still concepts people feel passionately about. Letting ""the market"" rip does not satisfy most people's sense of social justice and, besides, ""the market"" is largely a myth when it comes to rewards. The state fixes the low pay of care assistants and hospital cleaners, grateful for the pathetic raise to £4.50 an hour they get this month. Remuneration committees steeped in their own pretended ""market"" fix one another's salaries among   directors. The small pool of experienced hospital and town hall CEOs are now inflating their own pay in pretended competition. Middle-managers, catching the fever, are being paid new multiples above those they manage. Few can offer even a rule-of-thumb justification any longer for what they are paid, except tradition and luck. Examine most pay grades and the myth of a genuine ""market"" is usually exposed as a fraud.  Footballers are among the few whose pay makes some sort of sense. The affront caused by their incredible salaries is classist - an inverted class envy by the haves against counter-jumping have-nots whose skills are dclass  and undeserving. But where is the tariff to suggest what fair rewards might be? There should be at least some benchmark."
10,"It is a telling comment on our times that it was a very rich American that gave the very rich British a lesson in philanthropy. The super-rich have done well from the Eighties and Nineties but they have not reciprocated in kind in Britain. As inequality of wealth balloons back to nineteenth-century levels there is no sign of nineteenth-century levels of civic engagement and philanthropy by the rich. If anything, the opposite is true. Sir Paul Getty's life was a tribute to the futility of regarding personal wealth as an end in itself. Riches literally killed him - his death at 70 last Thursday was largely the result of having broken his health in the 1960s and 1970s by using heroin and cocaine without limit because he could and because he needed to.  When your living needs are met many times over for the rest of your life without your having to lift a finger, then any sentient body starts to ponder what it is all about. And, after 20 years of answering the question by being out of his head, Sir Paul in the later stages of his life came up with a different answer. It was to give.  He described himself as a professional philanthropist, and last week's obituaries lavishly named him as probably Britain's greatest of the breed. Whether it was the £50 million to the National Gallery or his last gift to St Paul's Cathedral, the list of his beneficiaries is impressive. Over 20 years he gave away some £120m. But in the context of a fortune worth an estimated £1.6 billion and an annual income of around £80m, he probably gave away no more, on average, than 10 per cent of his income every year.  That's 10 per cent more than many other very rich people, and enough to make an enormous difference to the institutions who received it - but it was a level of giving that made only the slightest dent on his fortune. His philanthropy gave him a sense of purpose without seriously damaging his wealth, and it oiled the wheels of a lot of worthy causes and left the country culturally the better.  We should expect all our rich to behave the same. That Sir Paul was so unusual is an indictment of both the way in which the rich define themselves in relation to society and of our diminished expectation of what that relationship should be. Sir Paul should be the norm, not the fted exception.  But Sir Paul also gives a clue as to why this should be. He was an American who loved England, and carried the best American attitudes to giving to his adopted country. The American rich expect to be celebrated as being rich - it's a sign of industriousness, hard work and guile - but equally they expect to give some of their wealth away as part of the bargain with the society of which they are part. In Britain, the rich want to be able to enjoy their wealth with the same lack of guilt and even approbation - but they have no intention of putting anything back except under duress. Charitable giving runs at half the rate it does in the US, and is sustained by ordinary people in their millions; the British rich are scarcely in evidence.  What has happened is that simultaneously with the collapse of religion has come the refusal of the rich to champion liberal and social democratic values. The result has been that we end up with the worst of both worlds. Christianity has very specific claims to make of the rich. God gave the world to all humanity, and every human being is equal in his eyes; Christ died to save everyone - the heart of the Easter message - and we can all expect to find life after death provided we try (even if we fail) to live up to Christian precepts. The rich are not a race apart. They must live by the same Christian values as all of us, including charity to their fellow men and women.  This Christian egalitarianism was the hallmark of the early Church. The wealthy were expected to contribute more to the common good and they did - the idea of noblesse oblige which underpinned feudalism. It is an egalitarianism and commitment to fairness which surfaces again and again - in the medieval idea of the just wage or successive Papal encyclicals. After the English Civil War the Leveller movement famously invoked biblical texts to justify universal suffrage and redistribution of income - demands for which they were crushed by Cromwell. Yet when the English puritan tradition migrated to America and made exactly the same demands, the founding fathers responded with the American constitution and, as John Adams said, the promise of enough land in the New World for all without having to redistribute from rich to poor. The rich instead would give back of their own volition in a universe in which everybody was held to have a chance of being similarly rich - the American social bargain that excuses gross inequality even today.  It took the rise of socialism to drive home a social bargain in Britain, but the rich never accepted its legitimacy. They resented progressive taxation of income and wealth to finance their contribution to the commonweal as an illegitimate confiscation of what their families owned by right. Yet for the majority in the country it was the long overdue assertion of what should always have been their obligation, and thus made what the rich kept for themselves - still substantial - legitimate. One-nation Tories insisted on the same basic bargain, while the rich smouldered in revolt fathering elaborate tax avoidance and evasion industries.  Socialism was its own worst enemy; it preferred to characterise progressive taxation as a half-way house to full socialism rather than the new social bargain that it really was, thus fatally undermining the principle. A social bargain was defensible while a levelled-down society was not and Britain's rich have fought off all claims on their purse with righteous indignation. The substitution of the Labour party's Clause 4 with another that does not argue for the explicit public interest of a social bargain represented their most complete victory.   So we arrive at today; executives clamouring for American levels of remuneration but not accepting either an American approach to giving or a European approach to taxation and with no live values based political coalition to fight back.  Sir Paul loved England and its civilities - the ritual of a cricket match or the beauty of its long tended countryside. Yet what lies behind that has been a bitterly fought-for social bargain sustained by three traditions now in decline - Christianity, one-nation Toryism and socialism. It would be comforting to hope that we might produce some British philanthropists with Sir Paul's readiness to give, but until our society can find a legitimate way of talking the language of social bargains there is little chance. The country that Sir Paul loved is in peril."
10,"It seems a long time ago now, but there was a time when Israel was not only the Middle East's only democracy but a source of liberal inspiration. The kibbutz movement was a living example of how to build a new society based on genuine equality of opportunity and mutuality of respect in collective democratic communes that actually worked. I remember friends who had spent their gap year working on them eulogising about the experience. That was then.Today, Israel's kibbutz movement is in crisis as a succession of right-wing governments has redirected subsidies to support settling the West Bank, where settler numbers are now double those working on kibbutzim.  The movement is paying the price for clinging to outdated nostrums, like belief in caring, equality and collective action, building Israel within its pre-1967 borders while recognising a Palestinian state and valuing the endless possibility of human development.   Like the rest of what constituted the once noble Israeli Labour movement, it has been shattered by the cruel marriage of religious and free-market fundamentalism. There is no more room for visionary ideas about building an Israel that will be a beacon for humanity whatever their faith. Israel is engaged in a fight to the death.  The resulting brutalisation of Israeli society is no more vividly demonstrated than by the overwhelming opinion poll support - 84 per cent - for building Sharon's security wall. It is a wall the International Court of Justice, supported by last week's non-binding vote in the UN's General Assembly, considers illegal because it will effectively annex up to a third or even a half of the Palestinians' current territory.  Indeed, even Israel's Supreme Court, in a reminder of the ideals upon which Israel was founded, has insisted on a review of where it is built. But Prime Minister Sharon can bark his defiance at the world, confident of the scale of domestic support.  Yet the evidence from history is that walls may look like the act of the strong; in fact, they are the last throw of the weak. Israel has come to a desperate pass if it clings to this as a solution to anything.  The trouble is that the liberal Israel, which might have offered a different vision, has been engulfed by Israel's religious zealots, with their insistence that it is Jewish destiny, warranted by biblical injunction, to create a Jewish state that will comprise all of the West Bank. The liberal secular traditionalists within Palestine, and with whom a genuine peace bargain might have been struck, are also beleaguered by fundamentalist religiosity.  Arafat's alleged corruption sparked the violent protests in Gaza last week, but it is not just about his personal failings; it springs from the deep factionalisation within Palestine, as terrorist groups grounded in extreme fundamentalism insist on no quarter, suicide bombing and permanent intifada.  The objective is the annihilation not just of Israel but all Jews. Arafat's Fatah movement is driven into its laager; terrorist groups like Hamas are in another.  In western Europe, secular liberals wrestle with how to integrate Muslim communities into our societies to end discrimination. At the same time, Muslims insist we must recognise that their faith - with traditions and practices that we sometimes find hard to accept - is central to their identity.  Even in Britain, with its tradition of religious toleratance, some can find this difficult. For instance, discrimination against women cannot be justified as part of faith-based identity. Many of us are not sure how to square concepts of faith-based identity with citizenship and equal rights.  Imagine the dilemmas in Israel. There, liberals face a double whammy: they have to negotiate with uncompromising Islam to secure recognition of Israel's right to exist, while their religious right is engaged in a project of overt colonisation, oppression and systematic abuse of human rights. Unable to make any advance on the first, they can offer no alternative to the second.  Professor Avi Shlaim, a Middle East expert, argues that such is the weakness of the Israeli liberal tradition that there has never been a real chance of Israel retreating to its pre-1967 borders, the precondition for peace, and the key reason why both the 1993 Oslo accords and Ehud Barak's apparently generous offer of West Bank territory at Camp David in 2000 ultimately got nowhere.  Yet Arafat has never been able to hold a united Palestinian position together for long enough for Shlaim's thesis to be proved; collapse into Palestinian terrorist attacks has been near instantaneous. Into the breach have stepped Sharon, the wall, unilateral entrenchment in the West Bank and the prospect of decades of violent stalemate.  The impact on Israeli liberalism has been profound. Jo-Ann Mort, co-author of Our Hearts Invented a Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive in Today's Israel?, shows how influential the kibbutzim once were in creating a secular Israeli morality, even in the armed services, and so meeting Martin Buber's aim - one of the secular founders of the movement - of Israel contributing to the development of humanity.  It is a receding dream.The decline of Kibbutzim is mirrored by the political disarray on the left. At the last elections, Labour won only 19 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Benny Morris, historian of Israel's war crimes and an iconic left-liberal thinker, now believes that David Ben-Gurion should have expelled the Palestinians from the West Bank in 1948 and that negotiation is impossible with Islamic fundamentalism. In this kind of environment, Israeli liberalism is wilting to the point of extinction.  This may be a cause of satisfaction to Israel's religious right and to Hamas alike; from its point of view, the more Israelis unite behind the concept of fortress biblical Israel, with all its dire economic and political consequences, the better.  But therein lies the rub. The religious fundamentalists on both sides of the divide want to extinguish their own secular, liberal traditions and those of their opponents because they are the peaceniks. Appealing to their respective gods, they can get on with the business of grinding each other down. Their only common belief is that secular Europe is soft and amoral.  As the US right becomes ever more in the grip of Christian fundamentalism and ever readier to support fundamentalist Israel and Islamic fundamentalism spreads throughout the Arab world, Europe has a duty to hold the line. Religious war, creating hell on earth for some impossible heaven in the afterlife, is a disaster.  Ultimately, both communities will look one day to their secular liberal traditions to broker peace - with Palestine given a fair share of the land and access to holy sites that everyone knows is the only solution. Europeans must try to keep that flame alive. The Israeli liberal left, however bleak it may look now, must do the same.  At its best, Israel is a noble idea, but it will never flower as a society of religious zealots behind a wall."
10,"You had to blink. Here was the Labour party giving the once-detested Peter Mandelson a standing ovation. Nor was it just his self-deprecatory jokes, his apology for the past and his declaration of love for the party. It was what he said about what he wanted to do  a recognisably social democratic but pro-wealth generation programme for building a new British economy. The Labour party roared its approval. The real importance of Labour's 2009 Brighton conference was the reconciliation between the party's new and old wings. It was never likely to be a launch pad to win a fourth electoral term. Falling membership, decimated representation in local government and decaying finances all spell the same message  even before the party confronts the issue of its dysfunctional leader. After 12 years in power, the accumulation of compromises and disappointed hopes is too much  let alone the economic bust that Gordon Brown promised would never happen. The country is determined on change and unless some dramatic event, cock-up or scandal blights the Conservatives, by next June David Cameron will be prime minister. What happened in Brighton, though, was more subtle and in the long term perhaps more significant. Labour arrived at a new settlement about what it stands for and wants to do with power  and it is right. The policy gap between the clever standard-bearer of Labour's left, Jon Cruddas, and New Labour's tribune, Peter Mandelson, is now surprisingly small. There will be some blood-letting after the defeat, but with differences this narrow there is no basis for all-out civil war. Labour with the right new leader (probably David Miliband) could get back on its feet quickly and become a contender for power very fast  challenging a Conservative government that has too quickly surrendered to the hysteria over the budget deficit and is set to make some seriously wrong judgments on both the economy and Europe. For politics in the 2010s is going to be very different from the politics of the last 30 years. The Tories won four consecutive elections after 1979 because the political and intellectual currents were so passionately pro-free market; communism and socialism were bankrupt ideologies that had failed in practice and in theory. The 1992 general election defeat was a watershed. It convinced Blair, Brown and Mandelson that whatever their new leader John Smith might think, there was no electoral majority for any social democratic intervention in the economy, however clever or well-designed. Markets and business must rule unequivocally. Labour had to shed any pretension to intervene, redistribute or overtly promote fairness, and could only govern as a quasi One Nation Conservative party, spending the dividends from economic growth not on tax cuts but improved public services, from which the middle class would benefit too.Thus New Labour. Although the party won a landslide in 1997, paradoxically it won as a beaten tradition. What little social democratic radicalism it possessed, like introducing the minimum wage, were commitments made by the revered but dead John Smith from which it could not escape. It would do small social democratic things  such as the public benefit test for charities or introducing SureStart  but its only big economic social democratic commitment was to lift public spending on health, education and science. Reform was for public services; not for the private sector. The embrace of a pro-business, pro-minimal regulation, pro-City of London agenda was total. Gordon Brown's speech at Mansion House in June 2007 and Ed Balls's address to the British bankers in October 2006 were paeans to finance, financial innovation, light touch regulation, an FSA committed to promoting City interests (City bankers had been allowed to design its terms of reference) and the efficiency of markets  only marginally outflanked by George Osborne and David Cameron. After all, it seemed that everything was working like clockwork. There was prosperity, an ongoing opinion poll lead, improving public services and moderate taxation. The electorate had no appetite for a return to social division and the strident certainties of Thatcherism. The Brownites walked on water, pretending to their party that they were the true custodians of socialism, deriding Blair, while being feted in the City.   Then came the credit crunch and near collapse of the British and western banking system. Friday's shocking US unemployment figures were a salutary reminder of how hard it will be for western economies to shake off the deadly legacy of a broken banking system and shattered business confidence. There is no easy prosperity for New Labour to piggyback upon, and no easy appeal to Thatcherite low taxes, light regulation and free markets as the solution. Simultaneously to manage recovery, rebalance the economy and restructure much of the private and public sector in the aftermath of a financial shock of this magnitude  requires complex, sophisticated and non-ideological responses. The quest is on for a set of ideas that can deal with the new realities. Politics promises to be a lot more like it was in the 1960s and '70s when parties regularly alternated office, trying to put together something that might work in the face of intractable problems, rather than holding power for three or four consecutive parliaments. Brown's speech was thus even more important than Mandelson's. On first listening, it was another Brown clunker  overlong, declaiming rather than arguing, avoiding awkward truths and policy reversals rather than confronting and explaining them. But even his critics acknowledged that, despite all that, it had an unexpected force. Brown, although he would never acknowledge it, had reversed the judgment he made on election night 1992. He publicly and enthusiastically returned to social democracy. He attacked free-market fundamentalism. He insisted that finance should be the servant of business and society rather than its master. Brown was now a social democratic regulator and social democratic builder of a new financial system  proposing the creation of an investment corporation. Alongside that he proposed social investment  a National Care Service  and the democratic overhaul and renewal of British democracy. He answered the question of what Labour stood for and what it wants to do with power. There are gaps  Labour has not thought hard about why public initiatives so frequently become self-defeating and oppressive, nor about how to marry state and business more effectively. But the party is on the right track, and will not disintegrate when it loses. There is nothing serious to argue about. Last week may not have stopped a Tory victory, but it made it more likely that in the middle years of the next parliament, Labour will genuinely be challenging for power again. Brown, for all his painful limitations, is keeping Labour together and making it a real contender in 2014 or 2015. It might have been the best that any Labour leader could have done."
10,"They hunt in packs, don't take risks, and are obsessed with sex. All that counts are ratings. The controllers and schedulers of British television are under fire - even as they roll out their stock replies that creativity has never been higher, accusations of dumbing down never more inaccurate and public service broadcasting never more secure. Who is kidding whom?After a week in which ITV's outgoing director of programmes, David Liddiment, accused the BBC's director general, Greg Dyke, of having no conception of the BBC's obligations - to which of course the BBC replied with traditional outrage - one senior television executive put his hand up on Friday to declare that in one part the criticism is justified. Mark Thompson, the chief executive of Channel 4, used the Edinburgh Television Festival's MacTaggart Lecture to launch a mea culpa.Our television suffers from a creativity deficit, he acknowledged - and since he moved to his present job from being the BBC's director of programmes, that is an admission from the belly of the broadcasting establishment's beast. Too much is 'dull, mechanical and samey'. Too few risks are taken; too much commissioning is about assuaging vested interests, box-ticking and repeating formulae that have worked. Channel 4 and a newly-fashioned relationship with the independent sector is the solution, he argued, and is an essential part of any complete conception of public service broadcasting. The sting in the tail was that, in addition to its commitment to the BBC licence fee, the Government should offer Channel 4 support if the advertising recession gets worse, to protect what Thompson promised would be a new upsurge in its creativity.This was an implicit criticism of the BBC - any creativity deficit surely extends to them - but also a clever way of expressing a growing fear stretching across broadcasting that the advertising party is over. Rates have fallen some 15 to 20 per cent over the last year, and leading media analyst John Billett warns that a further round of tariff reductions is in the offing. Nor, he says, will advertisers come back as normal in the next economic upturn; television advertising is becoming a weak instrument for achieving companies' sales and marketing aims and they are turning to other means of promotion. Couple this structural shift with the relaunch of digital terrestrial TV in the autumn and the competition promised in the Communications Bill, and even the painful restructuring that Channel 4 is promising to regain profitability could be inadequate. For Granada and Carlton, losing audiences with dismal schedules and having made epic strategic mistakes over digital television, the financial implications are even more dire.Yet, as Thompson recognised, it is not as though this potential financial crisis comes after a golden period of British television, Channel 4 included. As the channels roll out their autumn schedules, with the usual drumbeat of boasting about new thresholds of innovation and originality, there is little doubt that their foot soldiers broadly agree with Thompson - at least judging from those I spoke to in Edinburgh.Take the unstoppable march of sex on television. The mainstream broadcasters want to pretend, first, that it is not primarily about masturbatory titillation but factual information and entertainment; second, that there are not that many truly 'adult' programmes; and, third, that there has not been a contagion effect whereby sex crowds out other programmes and sexualises much of what remains. This fools no one. The headlong sexualisation of British television is obvious to all and Thompson's channel has been leading the charge.One of the opening sessions at the festival on Saturday - 'Must have sex in the title' - unsatisfactorily wrestled with the issue as four male commissioning editors of sex programmes reflected on what were they were up to. All were in a bind. If they pretended their programmes aimed to be solely factual they were being disingenuous; if they tried being honest they sounded like pimps. The truth is that sex brings audiences, and adult sex brings higher audiences; that Channel 5 established itself with sex; that channels such as Bravo win quarter million audiences with programmes on Las Vegas porn queens; and that schedulers under financial and competitive pressure are going to give us more and more. This autumn Channel 4 will offer a history of pornography; Channel 5 a series on what turns us on; and the BBC a drama series on lesbian love (lesbian sex is a ratings winner).A more liberal approach to sex on mainstream television is overdue; that is not the issue. Nor is it in doubt that reality TV, of which we will also see more, wins audiences. What is at stake is what is foregone, and how other kinds of programmes - about social, business, cultural, foreign or political issues - are pushed to the margins of mainstream channels or into marginal channels like BBC4. The ecology of our broadcasting, and thus our culture, is steadily corroded. Yes to populism and sex - but they should remain part of a broader mix. Television is about enlarging our shared experience; that experience is in danger of becoming narrow and uncreative.It falls to the BBC, the only channel with the financial strength, constitutional obligation and reservoirs of creativity to provide leadership against this trend. Although Liddiment's attack on Dyke last week was weakened by ITV's self-inflicted wounds, he spoke for a growing consensus. The pressure on commercial broadcasters is already acute; survival demands they play safe - and even Thompson's brave words were qualified by the warning that his channel might need public support.At this, BBC executives tend to smile and shrug; we're damned if we're successful, they complain, damned if we're not. The BBC's responsibility is also survival - that means playing by the same rules as the rest in order to preserve public service broadcasting. If that was once right, it is no longer - and seriously misreads of what's afoot. The BBC can and must lead; its standards for success need to be greater than market share. Yet my impression after Edinburgh is this is not likely. Television - habitually self-regarding and inward-looking - has seriously lost its way."
10,"Love or hate it, there is no denying the sporting, cultural and even economic importance of football. Yet it is a British fiasco, plagued by self-defeating greed and pockmarked with escalating corruption. It is an exemplar of Britain at its worst, an all-too-familiar story of how cowboy capitalism, personal vanity, timid government, an unobserved rulebook, uninquisitive journalism and ineffectual leadership is bringing a great sport to its knees. The heart of the problem is the temptation of personal riches beyond the dreams of avarice in a world with very weak rules, policed by the very same people who stand to benefit from their weak imposition. Thus, with the arrival of television money, comes the demi-monde of powerful agents, bungs, inflation of players' salaries, a frenzied transfer market and entrenchment of power and money in a few top clubs. Thus, the silting-up of the processes by which our own talent might be developed; nearly half the players registered in the Premier League are not British.  Everybody knows of the shenanigans, but by indulging them, the signal is sent out that there is no penalty for amoral behaviour. If we can, we all should do the same. For what football demonstrates more eloquently than any economic tract is how feeble are the self-regulating tendencies of capitalist markets, of how easy it is for industries to succumb to perverse and self-destructive incentives and of the necessity for external intervention by way of regulation and rules to make good those endemic shortcomings. That football should have arrived at its current pass is testimony to British incapacities. We don't just lack understanding of why things end up as they do - we lack the leaders with the inspiration and organisational skill to put things right.  You may consider some of this over the top, but even allowing for author Tom Bower's predilections for unrelievedly seeing the worst of human nature, his recent book on football,  Broken Dreams, is a  tour de force. The cumulative impact of the evidence he assembles is devastating. There is Harry Red- knapp, the then manager of West Ham, buying 144 players in his seven-year tenure in office, some of whom hardly made an appearance on the pitch.  There is George Graham's famous 'unsolicited gift' of £425,000 in used £50 notes from agent Rune Hauge for the transfer of Pal Lydersen, a transaction that would cost Graham his job as Arsenal manager and Hauge a two-year disqualification.  It was the same Hauge who had organised one of Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough's more infamous bungs. But, nine years later, Leeds United were to pay £1.7 million in agents' fees for the £16 million purchase of Rio Ferdinand, including to the same Rune Hauge, a payment, we learnt in the subsequent investigation, that was authorised in line with club policy.  Terry Venables's astonishing career, including his disqualification on 19 counts as a company director until 2005 after the DTI's investigation into his private company, Edennote, is detailed with grisly fascination, as is the rise to power of Ken Bates, chairman of Chelsea, a story in which tax havens and a partner, Stanley Tollman, accused in New York last year of 33 charges of fraud and tax evasion, figure highly. So it goes on. And throughout it all, the Football Association is revealed as a toothless onlooker, with almost every club in the premiership with its particular unpleasant skeleton in the cupboard,  It was only 12 years ago that the then First Division was receiving £1.8 million a year for selling exclusive TV rights; in 2001, Sky paid £1.3 billion over three years. Moreover, the revenue is distributed not equally, as it is in American football, but according to a formula weighted by appearances on TV. Thus, the more you win, the more you earn from TV and clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United get on a self-reinforcing cycle of success.  Another product of the sudden influx of money - that players have become important capital assets in their own right - and the incentive structure for self-defeating behaviour is complete. An important source of additional income has come from trading players. If, as Redknapp acknowledged, a manager outside the top knows that his life expectancy in the job is going to be shortlived because the chance of winning in an environment skewed towards entrenching the already powerful is small, then the incentive is to trade players enthusiastically in the elusive hope of building a squad that will at least allow avoidance of relegation - and make some profits in the process.  If impossible debts are incurred and a few hands are greased along the way by players' agents, with money getting lost in tax havens and private companies, so be it. Grab what you can while you can, a view indulgently and variously endorsed by former Sports Minister Tony Banks and television commentator Gary Lineker.  The supposed regulator is the FA, but it has been taken over by the Premier League, now occupying the same offices and with its key committees run by Premier League chairmen. So the FA's compliance unit is answerable to the same people it is policing, a truly hopeless structure.  Whether it's Premier League chairmen's niggardliness over releasing players for England games, the veto on considering a more equitable distribution of TV revenues or a reluctance to insist that accounts and payments to agents are transparent, the decisions go back to the root cause. The system is run by the rich for the rich, the regulator is captured and in the jungle every man is out for himself.  Hopes that clubs becoming publicly quoted companies would change things have also been dashed. British company law and standards of corporate governance are so low that football's abuses are comfortably accommodated. Indeed, a recent attempt to improve our standards of corporate governance through the Higgs committee's recommendations is being as stoutly resisted by the CBI as the Premier League resists any form of independent regulation. The fat cats fight hard to protect their cream.  It does not matter that England lost 3-1 to Australia; it's when Sky lowers its fee for television rights, as it surely will next year, that a number of indebted and badly run Premier League clubs will go bankrupt - and the sport as a competitive spectacle will be further damaged and left even more firmly in the hands of the leading clubs. The only way out is strong, independent regulation coupled with some enlightened leadership in the sport. But for that, you can whistle in the wind.

10,"There are two risks that every reader of this column runs. The certain risk is that you will grow old. The contingent risk is that you may suffer some catastrophic accident that renders you disabled or incapable. This may happen before you are old though it is much more likely when you are already old. A fifth of Britain's pensioners are incapable of looking after themselves; injury as much as infirmity is the cause.  The philosophic and political question is how should society respond. The conservative view is that such risks should be each individual's responsibility, and that the only intervention by the state should be to underwrite the circumstances of the very poorest who simply do not have the wherewithal to look after themselves. The liberal view is that because old age is certain and the consequences of a catastrophic and unpredictable accident are just that - catastrophic and realistically uninsurable - then these are definitive areas where the responsibility should be collective. The division is decisive; it defines a crucial difference between Left and Right.   In Britain the conservative view has held sway for 20 years. The large moral proposition about the superiority of individual responsibility has been supported by two important sub-propositions. The first is that the delivery of support for the elderly by the state is often inefficient, and is better performed by the private sector; even the state's 'promise' about providing a good pension is fragile and better respected by the private sector. The second is that the state cannot afford - given an increasingly ageing population - to undertake collective responsibility for personal care and guarantee the value of the basic state pension even if it wanted.  We must abandon universal provision and substitute targeted, means-tested provision only for the very needy. Thus the state pension has been allowed to become worth progressively less, indexed only to the growth of prices generally rather than wages. A safety net, the Minimum Income Retirement Guarantee, is  de facto replacing the universal provision element of the state pension, meaning that individuals, from young disabled to elderly, who need personal care have been means tested to ensure only the poor get their care paid for.   But last Thursday came a crucial dent in the conservative consensus. Liberal Democrat members of the Scottish Executive, under pressure from their party in the Scottish Parliament, forced the Labour leader of the Executive and Scotland's First Minister, Henry McLeish, into an extraordinary U-turn. Scotland is now committed to the universal provision of free personal care for the elderly, and a study group is to report by August on how to proceed. Scotland is demonstrating that it belongs to the European liberal mainstream, and is declaring independence from conservative England. More ominously for New Labour, it is yet more evidence that the custodianship of Britain's progressive tradition is passing from them.   For New Labour strongly and passionately disagrees with universal and collective provision for old age and its consequences. It is readier to build a stronger safety-net for low-income groups than the Tories would consider, but its position is conservative even if at the liberal end of that spectrum. It has refused to consider the central recommendation of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the elderly that it set up after the election: that personal care for the elderly should be provided by the state free of charge with only living or 'hotel' costs to be means-tested.  Instead, in its new Health and Social Care Bill, New Labour wants to standardise nationally the current lottery of means-tested charging, currently varying between local authorities, and wind down a worthwhile universal basic state pension. In this area, Labour is becoming the party of One Nation conservatism. The Liberal Democrats are assuming the mantle of championing the liberal and centre-Left propositions on collective responsibility.   The case for universal provision of free personal care for the elderly was made eloquently by the Royal Commission. 'Long term care,' it reported, 'is a contingency not a probability. Neither its incidence nor the scale of care needed are predictable. It is equitable and proper for the state to meet at least one element of the catastrophic costs for everyone. And the costs in the future in relation to   people's likely means will remain catastrophic.' It rejected outright the notion that individuals could take responsibility for the cost of personal care that might follow a catastrophe, because this was not a risk the mainstream insurance industry was prepared to accept. Indeed, standard insurance for personal care in old age is prohibitively expensive.   As for the argument about open-ended public expense with an ageing population, the Commission was simply scornful. It dismissed the widespread notion that the country is labouring under a demographic time bomb; Britain's pensioner population is growing, but not greatly in relation to the numbers of people of working age. In any case, the costs of providing long-term care for pensioners and the disabled are not great (£800 million to £1,200m), and affordable if we choose.  The report was completed before the emergence of a structural budget surplus, which further weakens the argument about unaffordability. The moral and practical imperative, the Commission felt, was to offer personal care free, with individuals still paying for living and housing costs while means-testing protected the poorest.   In short, the key conservative arguments - individual responsibility, the relative efficiency of the private sector, the ageing population and the cost to the Exchequer - cut no ice. In this area the balance of the argument was to act collectively. Yet apart   from some concessions on lifting the threshold of wealth before the means test applies, the Government has been stoutly opposed to any reform. But now it confronts the move in Scotland, which if it isn't fudged, is a direct challenge to its stance.   In my view, the argument extends to the basic old-age pension. The state 'pension promise' has not been solid. But then the private sector-pension 'promise' is a lot less solid than the propaganda assumes, being subject to the vagaries of stock-market performance, annuity rates and, as 900,000 holders of Equitable Life pension plans found out, to pension fund mismanagement.  What future pensioners need is neither to be wholly reliant on the state nor on the market, but to have their risks balanced. Just as everyone has the right to free universal personal care, so everyone has the right to a solid universal state pension whose level is automatically linked to the rise in general living standards. We should rely on a combination of our savings, our employers' pension scheme and a good state pension for income in old age - and not try to pretend that the private sector provides a free option.   Because it doesn't. The Government may boast about healthy public finances, but if the consequence is to displace risk on to those incapable of accepting it then the boast is hollow. Universal personal care and a universal state pension are hallmarks of a society that understands the limits of individual responsibility. Congratulations to Scotland's Liberal Democrats. Without them the proposition would be dead. And welcome devolution."
10,"The two most harrowing parts of any trip to Vietnam, where the war against the United States - even 40 years on - still dominates, are the Cu Chi tunnels north of Saigon and the Mekong Delta. As you emerge from crouching in the warren of once deadly, booby-trapped foxholes and command centres, there are decaying photos, pinned on trees and walls, of Vietcong soldiers with their decorations for being effective 'American killers'. The war's savagery and brutality could hardly be more effectively conveyed. But as terrifying and futile as trying to penetrate the Vietcong tunnel system was trying to prevent the Mekong Delta - Vietnam's rice basket - from falling entirely under Vietcong control. The maze of slow-moving interlocking rivers and canals with dense, overhanging foliage offered perfect cover for attacks on US patrol boats.  Time and again, as we navigated today's tourist attractions of floating markets and shrines, I thought how it must have felt in a different time to be stalked by an enemy who had such amazing cover so close to their targets. But it was in this delta that Senator John Kerry, then a lieutenant, turned his Swift boat to attack his tormentors directly, going ashore to kill the Vietcong soldiers who were armed with B40 rocket launchers that could sink a US boat.  Vietnam veterans now hold a particular place in US life. They may have fought in America's most controversial war before Iraq, but their physical and psychological wounds are testimony to the fact they served their country even in a futile cause. (Their war culminated in an ignominious scuttle but strategically it bought the rest of South-East Asia more than a decade in which to deliver the capitalist Asian miracle; the immediate war was lost but a bigger struggle for economic power was eventually won.)  It is testimony to the profound dominance of conservatism on the American national consensus, with the noxious charge of not being patriotic that is levelled by Bush against any critic, that the best way any liberal voice can fireproof himself against such a charge is to play the Vietnam vet card. As Kerry says, in order to be heard about the rollcall of domestic issues that concern ordinary Americans, any Democratic presidential candidate has to get past the security issue; being a decorated Vietnam vet offers Kerry the passport.  So now for one safe-ish forecast and one risky prediction, which I wish I had written last May when I first met the Kerry camp. Kerry is going to win the nomination to be the Democrat presidential candidate and I think he will go on to beat George Bush. American democracy may have its grievous defects - the role of money, the grotesquely gerrymandered congressional districts, the low turnouts and all the rest - but it still retains a core functionality.  Bush led his country into an illegitimate war for trumped-up reasons; the consequent morass is already costing more than $100 billion, many American lives and profoundly compromising US and Western interests. In a democracy, you pay for such fundamental misjudgments with your job and Bush will pay with his.  The American democratic process in this respect is showing its underlying smartness. Howard Dean's emergence as the Democratic front runner for President last year was very important. He articulated the raw anger that the Democrat base felt at Bush and he reminded the Democratic establishment about core Democratic values.  If you weren't stirred by Dean's rallying call, you had cold blood. But it isn't and wasn't good enough to get mad - Democrats have to get even.  Too much is at stake in this election to risk the indulgence of a candidate who, however fiercely he may proclaim his commitment to fiscal conservatism and toughness on crime, is now so far from the centre as Dean, and who, moreover, does not have the cachet of having seen military service. In January, faced with the sobering truth that 2004 is an election year, Democrat voters have turned their back on Dean's rage and embraced the war hero. They want their case to get to first base.  To British eyes, the quality of speech-making and capacity to stir emotions in the state primaries, where the rival candidates pitch for voting support in August's convention, has been eye-opening. John Edward's invocation of two Americas and advocacy of an effective social contract for every American is high octane and passionate. But both Howard Dean and John Kerry, with his call for a 'Real Deal', are not far behind. They have found a language to talk social-contract politics, even if they never mention the term; they indict the corruptions of American capitalism; they celebrate the capacity of public action to offer remedies.  And Kerry, I am glad to note, has got the bit between his teeth over sky-high university tuition fees pricing students from ordinary backgrounds out of college education. It was the statistics about America's declining social mobility and the now incredible debt that students have to assume that interested his chief of staff most when we met. I thought and still think that this is an undersung issue the Democrats can use to appeal to middle-class swing voters.  So much is going for the Democrats - demography and the growth of the black and Hispanic vote, the social libertarianism of the cities, the insecurities of American life, the decline of opportunity and the massive failures of Bush's foreign policy - that what effectively stands between them and the presidency is the South, a hawkishly conservative media and atavistic fear of terrorism.  Bush's position is much weaker than it seems; even in the South, voters are worried about their children leaving college with debts of $50,000 or more and the rank unfairness of American society. The conventional wisdom is that America is polarised along 50/50 lines; it is certainly polarised, but the split is more like 60/40 or even 65/35 - and with the right candidate who can escape the tag of being a wimp because he is not conservative, there is every chance of enlisting that majority.  Bush will certainly narrow the gap with a blitz of what will be some of the nastiest political advertising yet sanctioned in the US, but I still think this is an election the Democrats can win.  Which is where Kerry's experience in Vietnam is so vital; he can argue for the importance of legitimacy in fighting wars, of being on the right side of the moral argument and of the need for genuine international coalitions without being cast as another draft-dodging liberal; indeed, he can hurl back that charge with interest.  The pity is that Bush will wheel out Blair as proof that Kerry is wrong, a measure of how badly Blair has played every aspect of Iraq. Democrats don't want to see or hear from him this year in the US. I don't blame them. That Blair is a liability to the progressive tradition on both sides of the Atlantic is a damning indictment. If the Democrats want him to be silent, then silent he'd better be. We want Kerry as President, too."
10,"Britain has never accepted that cities are at the heart of its economy, society and civilisation. Rather, they are something we put up with. The loved Britain is the idyllic country - Palladian mansions and parks for the rich; rose-covered cottages for the poor. Cities are sinks of decay, deindustrialisation, crime, poverty, congestion and blight. Yet to despair of our cities is to despair of our civilisation. The Italian Renaissance grew out of its vibrant cities; the flowering of Victorian industrialisation was centred on the great civic culture that tried to roll back squalor and celebrate urban life. If Britain is to capitalise on nine years of steady growth it will be when our cities, notably those outside London, start to reproduce the capital's economic and social vitality.  There are signs of life. Three years ago, seven English cities outside London - Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Bristol, Liverpool and Sheffield, and now joined by Nottingham - clubbed together to form the Core   Cities group. Their proposition is that vibrant cities are the solution to economic and social ills. They want a recasting of their financial and political relationship with London in order to revitalise themselves.  Last Friday, meeting in Manchester, they won important concessions from the Government - a recognition from Lord Falconer, Minister for Housing and Planning, of the legitimacy of their case and a promise from Stephen Byers, Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, that he would ease the incredibly centralised control of planning, borrowing and even revenue-raising that throttles regional cities.  The scale of what needs to be done is huge. Research from the universities of Manchester and Leeds and the LSE shows that the economic and social gap between the core cities and their regions with London and the South-East has steadily widened since 1993, in sharp contrast to what has been happening elsewhere in the European Union. The inequalities in opportunity and income that preoccupy Gordon Brown and which will surface in his Budget this week are systemically geographic.  Unless the core cities can begin genuinely to revitalise themselves, the Government's ambitions for reducing inequalities in poverty, health and education, along with closing the productivity gap, will remain stillborn.   London's growth is instructive. It is the city above any other in Europe that has benefited from globalisation. All its traditional strengths and infrastructure have been boosted by a process that has required little or no direction. Its airports have become major sources of competitive advantage, so that west London, close to Heathrow, has a booming cluster of knowledge- and information-technology-based companies feeding off Heathrow's linkages. Similarly, the City is a massive beneficiary of the globalisation of financial markets. London's universities and teaching hospitals are prospering from a wave of foreign students and patients.  Multinationals base themselves in London to capture these advantages and so reinforce them. A new, smart manufacturing sector is emerging to service the financial and professional services industries. It is a remarkable shopping centre. A burgeoning micro-service sector, ranging from hairdressing and restaurants to professional gardeners and party-organisers, is growing to meet the demands of affluent households and small businesses.  Yet the core of its growth is based on the knowledge industries around which these other industries feed. It is the quintessential, knowledge-based 'ideopolis', a twenty-first-century version of what we first saw in Italian Renaissance city states.  The core cities outside London are the poor relations - they witness all this but are unable to do much about it. Much of their growth has been lopsided, skewed towards retailing rather than the integrated growth from which London has benefited. The British now have 10 square feet of retail space per person, five times the European average; 31 per cent of Europe's retail space is in Britain. All our regional cities boast enormous shopping malls that have brought jobs and growth. But these alone are an insufficient basis for urban regeneration and, if based outside the city centre, they often actively hurt it.  This is not to decry shopping; as a father of two teenage daughters, I have come to understand that shopping is a major cultural and social pleasure. Our retailers are sophisticated and highly efficient, and the next wave of shopping development needs to be shaped so that it boosts urban life. Shop architecture and the planning of shopping districts and malls need to become fundamental to the way cities think of promoting their liveability and attractiveness.  But alone this is not enough. Our core regional cities all have the capacity to become 'ideopolises' in their own right. Unlike London, they will have to direct their efforts rather than expect it to happen spontaneously. Above   all, they have to capitalise on the new institutions that underpin contemporary growth. First, airports and the districts around them have to become growth poles in their own right, and key linkages to the outside world. The quality of their transport links to the city and region they serve is no less fundamental.  Second, there are the universities, neglected as sources of intellectual capital generation, growth and cultural strength alike. World-class universities are the other new growth poles, especially if their ideas are diffused into local businesses and civic society.  To do this requires much more local political direction, autonomy, planning and financial power than our cities currently possess. They are Europe's political and financial weaklings. But they are also where the bulk of the electorate live. If the Tory party ever got politically savvy, it has a vast agenda to pick up and run with, which would reconnect it to the urban vote.  New Labour shows signs of recognising the importance of revitalising our cities after its early disdain for the conclusions of Lord Roger's urban task force. It needs to get serious about the entire programme - from building high-density housing to delegating more political and financial power - not just in the interests of our cities, but of its own political base. Cities are at the core of our civilisation. Let's recognise it and act."
10,"The real puzzle in next Tuesday's presidential election is why George W Bush is not going to get hammered. Tens of millions of ordinary Americans live in more economic insecurity and enjoy less opportunity as a result of the America he is building. Abroad he is leading his country into a dangerous and unwinnable confrontation with Islamic fundamentalism that obstructs the rooting out of terrorism, whose crassness is exposed daily in the flow of news from Iraq. A grass roots revolt should throw him out of office as an incompetent.And yet most polls give him the lead over challenger John Kerry by a narrow margin. The incumbency effect is part of the explanation, as is the skill with which Bush has played the security card. But the deeper truth is that conservative America has become a formidable cultural and electoral force - and it offers its allegiance to George Bush instinctively and unhesitatingly.Even if Kerry manages to win, American conservatism will remain the most dynamic component in American political life. Although a Kerry victory (for which I hope) is conceivable, it is already clear that the race is so tight that the Republicans will retain their grip on the House of Representatives - with little prospect of an early reversal. Talk to Republicans and they regard their control of the House together with more state legislatures as the heart of their power base; in the checked and balanced US political system the presidency is the necessary but insufficient condition for political leadership.In short, a Kerry victory would only be the end of the beginning; for the Democrats to move the US even marginally from its current hardening right-wing trajectory, the long-term task is the rebuilding and sustaining of the liberal coalition that they held from Roosevelt's New Deal to the end of the 1960s - and which will allow them to challenge what is now a Republican legislative dominance. That requires not just political energy and a mobilisation on the ground that the Democrats have only just begun to demonstrate - it also means winning the battle of ideas, where they are still at first base.The scale of  the challenge - and the political and intellectual embeddedness of US conservatism - is still not properly grasped. And why, despite his monumental mistakes and gawky malapropisms, Bush is still the narrow favourite to win?I got a clearer idea why in a debate at the Oxford Union on Thursday night; speaking for Bush's re-election was Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and one of the leaders of the American Conservative revolution. Norquist's rhetoric made little impact on his quintessentially British liberal audience - our pro-Kerry side was to win four to one - but you could see how effective his pitch would be in the US. The Democrats were a coalition of the liberal elite and the two wings of the 'Dependency Movement', he declaimed - those who receive welfare and those who administer it. When somebody got a job and became a Republican (working and being a Republican were coterminous) they quickly saw the case for paying less or no tax. The Republican base was at bottom about industrious, self-starting business people and workers who didn't want government to tell them what to do or spend so much of their money. Bush would continue to deliver to this constituency. Vote for him.  We've heard pitches for lower taxes before, but an Oliver Letwin or even John Redwood doesn't do it with the same sting or passion. What gives Norquist its bitter, cutting edge is the depth of his complaint. He's on the side of the ordinary American and the common man against the liberal elite and the do-gooders. They're the wine drinkers, the French speakers, the interferers in American lives, the indulgers of homosexuals, the mockers of faith and the upholders of political correctness.Norquist is on the side of working Americans living in the outer suburbs springing up like topsy around every US city; the network of soulless shopping malls, never-ending cloned streets and newly built churches created by the appetite of US property developers. These instant developments are communities only in name; their rootless inhabitants, questing for meaning in their lives, are the prey upon which the New Republicanism feeds.Its success, as Thomas Frank writes in his compelling book  What's the Matter with America? , is that it has used largely cultural symbols - against irreligion, abortion, gun control, stem-cell research - to build a new working-class constituency that believes an allegedly hegemonic liberal elite wants to do down what working America holds dear.They will build national parks on farmland, mandate special holidays for transgendered war veterans, decree only gay couples can adopt children, as part of the same world view that wants to control gun use and get UN resolutions to act in Iraq. Thus the working class becomes the ally of a party that gives tax cuts to the top 1 per cent and is set on undermining the institutions that try to offer working Americans security and opportunity. The irony could not be more complete.Frank sees no end in sight, largely because the secular forces unleashed by American capitalism are so powerful. This is the genius of the conservative position. It is a crusade fuelled by a never-ending tide of complaint that is compelled to set itself unachievable objectives in its battle to reduce women's rights and against the commercial ethic that so beleaguers religion but their non-achievement only proves the malevolent hegemony of the liberal elite and thus the correctness of the right's analysis.THIS HOSTILITY to modernity and sense of beleaguerment spills over to fuel an ugly American nationalism. Foreigners, and especially Muslim foreigners, are part of the threat to the values and lifestyles of ordinary God-fearing Americans. To cast the response to 11September as a war on terror not only offers a route to achieving American security; it enlists, as Bush knows full well, this new American nationalism to the cause and thus the side of militant Republicanism. To understand his campaign - speeches laced with biblical references, solidarity over every right-wing cultural icon, commitment to cut taxes and insistence he is the right commander-in-chief to lead the US in its war on terror - you need to understand the new forces underpinning American conservatism.Kerry and the Democrats confront a Hydra. They have assets - America's knowledge workers, Hispanics and blacks are all massively Democrat; a significant part of America's working class do understand which party represents their interests and are dubious about rabid conservatism.The good news is that this liberal coalition is giving Bush's Republican party such an effective challenge; the bad news is that it is not more effective still. Win or lose on Tuesday, progressive America still has a lot to do - but it would be better to start by winning."
10,"It is less than 30 years ago that the 20th-century's bloodiest dictator was approaching death, his country still dirt poor, his vision in ruins, with tens of millions of his fellow citizens dead at his hands. Today, that same country has enjoyed three decades of the most unparalleled economic growth. Mao's death has proved the trigger for an extraordinary economic renaissance. Nobody can disagree that he was a cruel and authoritarian despot who murdered millions; even his successor, Deng Xiaoping, pronounced that he was at least 30 per cent wrong and guilty of 'excesses'.  The open question is how much more wrong he was than the official assessment, how much of his legacy still informs the communist leadership and whether his long shadow and his thinking is any guide to what China might do in the future. If you think he was 100 per cent wrong, you must worry; China's Communist party has an evil DNA in its genes that will one day provoke war and mayhem with global implications. Agree with Deng and you might be more hopeful.  A new book, Mao: The Unknown Story (Jonathan Cape), places Mao unambiguously in the 100 per cent wrong category. Jung Chang, author of the compelling Wild Swans, the story of today's China through the pained eyes of three generations of women, and her husband, Jon Halliday, have used 10 years of research to indict comprehensively Mao's cynical lust for power and careless disregard for humanity. Whether it's the news that Mao never actually marched in long stretches of the Long March but was, instead, carried in a bamboo litter he designed himself, or of the scale of his purges and executions, this is a catalogue of disclosures that overturns almost all our received wisdom. The impact will be substantial.  It's an impressive achievement, but the book's unyielding view that there is not one even unintended benefit from his legacy leaves me uneasy. Mao is presented as an evil genius visited upon an innocent China courtesy of communist ideology which he cynically manipulated, who delivered nothing but murder and economic disaster.  It is blood lust and quest for world domination, for example, that drove Mao to consecrate the overwhelming share of China's scarce resources to the military in the first five-year plan; the drive to build dams and irrigation systems was carried out irrespective of the lives either of the builders or those later drowned by their collapse. When he saw violence at close quarters, he acknowledged it induced a kind of ecstasy.  And any idea that Mao was a great military strategist is dashed; even his victories are revealed as either disguised fiascos or the results of political fixes. Essentially, he led the communists to power by betraying efforts to find a common front against the invading Japanese, which he openly acknowledged, while carefully courting Moscow.  We are spared no detail of Mao's weaknesses - his failure to take a bath for 25 years, his 50-odd personal estates and his habit of having fresh fish delicacies from Wuhan carried 1,000 kilometres for his epicurean delight. I agree; guilty on all charges.  But Mao didn't come from nowhere. If you don't know about the century of China's humiliation, the complete bankruptcy of the Qing dynasty as it imploded in 1911 and the subsequent ungovernability of China and the apparent hopelessness of any project that might even half successfully modernise it, then it's hard to understand how it could be that Mao and Chinese communism would have any appeal. You will learn little of such context in this biography.  There is no country in modern times that has ever suffered so many defeats at so many hands as China did between 1842 and 1911; the British, the French, the Russians and the Japanese all easily disposed of Chinese armies and fleets. In 1898, the Western powers, including Germany, took great chunks of China and Chinese ports to administer for their own benefit. China was so weak that there was no point in spending money colonising it; foreign powers could get all they wanted by expending much less effort.  For the Chinese, their weakness was a complete bouleversement of their universe, and the contemptuously low status in which self-consciously racist foreigners held them (little more than animals) poured further salt in a gaping and humiliating wound. The system that had provided them with order for millenniums, granaries for famine, law, canals, agricultural prosperity and a sophisticated Confucian bureaucracy - and which presented the astounded Marco Polo as a civilisation more advanced, more peaceful and evidently superior to the never-ending conflict and barbarism of Europe - could neither rejuvenate itself from within nor begin to match the overwhelming achievements of the West.  How was this vast country, now collapsing into a myriad of local wars with peace provided by rapacious local warlords routinely deploying torture, to be governed? How was it to be industrialised? How could it defend itself against further despoilment by foreigners?  Communism, paradoxically building on the Confucianism it deplored, provided an answer, the reason it drew so many adherents. The strategy for modernisation - raising agricultural productivity by trial-and-error attempts at combining collectivisation with respect for village structures while building up industry on an equally decentralised basis - was very different from Stalin's centralised Sovietisation, despite the surface parallels.  It was more closely modelled on the imperial system than either critic or supporter ever concedes. And when Mao died, the second paradox is that the decentralisation and pragmatism he fostered, notwithstanding mad forays such as the campaign to kill sparrows, allowed Deng, the architect of today's China, quickly to put in place policies that would drive the astonishing economic turnround.   As for Mao's preoccupation with military spending, I submit that any new government in the 1950s would have placed an overwheening priority on defence, given China's history.  While the Great Leap Forward and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution are famed exercises in futility, personal delusion and inhumanity, brilliantly documented by Chang and Halliday, don't forget that between one and the other Chinese growth averaged 15 per cent per annum, never achieved before in a single year in China's long history.  China's vast rural hinterland was becoming, via the conception of village enterprise, the springboard for today's economic growth.  It would take Deng's opening up to trade and investment along the coast, and the reintroduction of capitalism, to make the most of the opportunity. But a Stalinistic communism would never have created the chance in the first place, as today's Russia bears grim witness.  Mao is now revealed as more of a monster than we ever guessed, thanks to Chang and Halliday. But even monsters can create good they may never have self-consciously aimed for or wanted.  History is the story of contradictions and unintended consequences. This book - and our understanding of China - would have been stronger still had it acknowledged them."
10,"George Bush's extravagant inauguration this week - in his own mind nearer to an annunciation - is not what most British and Europeans wanted. This is a second-term President with the lowest approval ratings ever at home; they are even lower abroad. Yet despite everything, from the debacle in Iraq to the tax cuts directed at the rich, it is Bush, not Kerry, presiding over no less than 10 inauguration balls and talking reverentially of his mandate, unsurprisingly, having increased his share of the vote compared to 2000 among almost every category of voter. This is one election he didn't steal.  But given the record, it is an unconvinced majority and it will be this lack of conviction, on top of the increasing lame duckness of a second-term President that promises to constrain some of the wilder instincts of both the man and his supporters.  Already, there are signs of a new emollience: the last British detainees at Guantanamo Bay have been released; the bitter trade row with the EU over the respective subsidies to Airbus and Boeing has been kicked into touch; and the core group of the US, Australia, India and Japan that was to subvert the United Nations by co-ordinating aid to the tsunami victims has been quietly disbanded.  Mr Bush talks about explaining his policies better to his European allies, in sharp contrast to his first-term plans to visit Europe and to do so within a month of the inauguration.  None of this is surprising. The radical neoconservatives who animated the first term have led the President and the country into a foreign policy mess. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State for Defence, is a much reduced figure from the self-confident swaggerer who so grossly underestimated how many troops it would take to pacify Iraq, the impact on world opinion on the flagrant disregard for human rights in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and the consequent collapse in morale in the overstretched US army. He got it wrong and it is a minor miracle he is still in office, protected by a President who prizes loyalty and shares many of his instincts.  Yet it is now blisteringly obvious that the derided State Department view of the world, that it is smart to have allies who can shoulder part of the cost of foreign interventions and that for all the awesome nature of America's military might, 'soft' power matters, too, has a validity that any US President ignores at his peril.  The instinct of Condoleezza Rice, who takes over from Colin Powell may be hawkish, but her newly appointed number two, Bob Zoellick, who spent the first term overseeing US trade interests, could not have been so effective had he been an uncompromising unilateralist. He understands the way globalisation serves US interests and the need to man age it with allies better than almost any other senior Republican; he will be the counsel of reality in an administration anxious not to get deeper into the mire, whatever its predilections for pre-emptive unilateralism.  Zoellick is also a pragmatist on China, a country that has moved from public enemy number one in Bush's former lexicon to a much more nuanced position today. Commentators variously ascribe Bush's victory to his support among evangelical protestants, his clear-cut stance on terrorism and his apparent leadership qualities, but there is another, less well-remarked-on explanation.  Bush's reaffirmation of his commitment to free trade and, in particular, keeping America's borders open to China at a key stage in the campaign, very much Zoellick's position, worked enormously to his advantage. It put Bush on the side of the emerging new American business model, relying on low, valued-added manufacturers from abroad with a dynamic service sector and knowledge economy at home, so positioning the Republicans paradoxically as the party of modernity and the Democrats of yesterday. Zoellick has been justly rewarded.  For when John Kerry and vice-presidential candidate John Edwards were launching their assault on free trade and 'Benedict Arnold' employers (Benedict Arnold famously tried to betray the American Revolution to the British) who exported jobs to foreigners, Bush held the line.  I remember being impressed at the time, but in retrospect it was an obviously smart move. The buoyant profitability of US corporations, the strength of Wall Street, US leadership in the knowledge economy and the rapid growth of jobs in the service sector are all constructed on free trade and, in particular, with the capacity to manufacture in China and Asia. Two-thirds of imports from China are from affiliates of American companies which are certainly exporting manufacturing jobs to Asia. But new jobs are being created distributing and selling the imported low-price goods in the US.  The resulting gigantic US trade deficit is, in part, sustainable for so long as the dollars to finance it are forthcoming. One of the central tasks of the second term will be to maintain this crucial inflow of dollars as the US's foreign debts rise to dizzying and potentially unsustainable levels, the pivot on which job generation and American prosperity in the booming suburbs, the heart of Republican support, depends.  This has enormous implications for federal spending and taxing plans; put bluntly, foreign investors will not put up with another round of tax cuts. They need to see the US government deficit narrow rather than expand, and Bush has been careful to stress in his round of pre-inaugural interviews that he wants to halve it. He talks less of tax cuts and tax reform, now delayed until 2006, more of attacking 'junk law suits' in a scandalously indulgent legal system and of offering US citizens a means of saving for their social security through personalised accounts.  But if the second Bush term promises to be less scary, with Republicans more mindful of reassuring their reluctant   majority that they are more level-headed than they are caricatured, some underlying truths remain.  They have a better line of sight on what makes American capitalism tick, and how to align it with Republican values, than the Democrats, who have lost their way. A Republican majority in the House of Representatives and Senate is going to be hard to dislodge, as is the new coalition in the country.  For the immediate future, a hegemonic US is likely to be run by Republicans and their instincts remain to kick ass and divide the world into those who are for them and those against. The appointments of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General, who famously wrote that the Geneva accords on the treatment of prisoners were quaint shows that Bush has lost none of his atavistic instincts - he's just cannier.  The second-term Bush may be calmer and more predictable towards the expected. Towards the unexpected - from a run on the dollar to another terrorist attack - we could see a vicious lurch backwards. Europeans are right not to drop their guard."
10,"Of those who attend a remembrance service today or wear a poppy or observe next week's silence, there can hardly be any who lived through the horrors of the First World War. Time is unforgiving; human beings only mortal. Another 10 years and there will be no one from that era. As the direct connections wither, the poppy's symbolism shifts; the living are free to endow it with the symbolic meaning they think fit, rather than the one in which it was rooted. After last week's American elections, left and right alike are keenly aware of the importance of national symbols and 'good' truths held in common, like the importance of patriotism, family and hard work. Republicans have made them their own, marginalising the Democrats so that, as President Clinton has said, they were made out to be two-dimensional aliens, the key reason they lost.  The British right has the same tempting opportunity to appropriate national symbols like the poppy as belonging to conservatives above all, especially as they relate to war, aggression and death, of which the left, with its pacifist and humanitarian instincts, is necessarily suspicious.  The danger is ever-present, both for the left and the country. The bitterness in the US is not only about the enormous distrust of the intentions of the right and reciprocal scorn for the left. It is also that the Republicans, by co-opting the symbols and icons of national solidarity as their own, make the explicit charge that not to be a Republican is to be un-American and foreign. Democrats, as much a part of their country as Republicans, are characterised as strangers, a divisiveness that takes political exchange to new levels of emotional violence.  Which is why the left in Britain must be vigilant that it never allows itself to find itself in the same position. Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon was only slightly over the top in his lampooned eagerness to wear a poppy as soon as he could this year. He was very New Labour in his understanding that the symbol, especially during the Iraq war, cannot be allowed for a nanosecond to become appropriated by the right.  One of the cultural underpinnings of Mrs Thatcher's political ascendancy was created when Michael Foot as leader of the opposition, attended the Cenotaph on remembrance day wearing what some commentators described as a donkey jacket. This was seized on by the right as a sign of Labour's disrespect for those who died to secure today's freedoms.  Foot and the Labour party never shook off the charge, which even clung to Neil Kinnock. It is fashionable in many parts of the left to deride New Labour for its eagerness to placate tabloid jingoism, but its conviction that it should never again lay itself open to the charge of being unpatriotic or of not believing in nation is absolutely right.  When I look back at the 1980s, what enrages me as much as anything was that the Conservatives acted as if they and they alone were true to the ideas of Britain and Britishness, setting out to characterise non-conservatives as, by definition, un-British. We were treated as aliens.  But to understand that, the left has an obligation to itself and the country to make sure that it owns our national symbols as much as the right. That does not mean that it has to be supine about what those symbols mean. Poppies, modelled in a stroke of genius on the flowers that grew in the trenches and in the mud beside by the dead, carried enormous emotional significance for a generation transfixed by the catastrophe of the slaughter.  Every family had been touched by the war; a great, great many had lost a son or father without ever having the opportunity to grieve at a funeral. For them, 11 November was a moment when they could collectively share grief that was raw and anchored in the agony of loss; in the years after the First World War, the country actually stopped, still awestruck at the scale of the suffering. It was a national moment of catharsis.  That cannot happen now. As a result, the fortnight of remembrance is at a fork in the road. The British Legion needs to maximise poppy sales if it is to sustain its vital work supporting British war veterans. For that, it has to mobilise the already dwindling ranks of volunteers to sell poppies - and for the British public to want to buy and wear them in millions. It needs to bring new emotions to a now remote event. The question is how to achieve that.  The honourable route is to use this time to remind us that the sacrifice of those who died could not be more complete or tragic - and it is right that we find a collective moment to honour them and grieve. Nations are built, in part, on the blood of their citizens. We remember the 20,000 Allied soldiers who died in the first day of the Somme, but we should also remember those now dying in Iraq. We belong to the same national community with a shared history and shared future.  The dishonourable route, always lurking just beneath the surface, is to remember that our war dead were killed by Germans. We must never forget war, but we must never allow Germany to forget, either, and never drop our guard about its potential to do it again. Last May's European elections, where 20 per cent of most English regions voted for Ukip, rising to an amazing 32.6 per cent in the East Midlands, was a wake-up call - if one were needed - about how noxious journalism, coupled with some native jingoism, has created a toxic anti-foreigner brew.  It was at work again last week during the Queen's state visit to Germany. Michael Portillo in the  Sunday Times and John Hughes-Wilson in the  Daily Express both wrote that, far from apologising to, or even sympathising with, Germans over the bombing of Dresden (or see it as a war crime), Britain should never allow Germany to forget its role in two world wars.  Portillo strained to argue that his desire to keep the wound open was not anti-German but rather anti-war, but the distinction doesn't hold. If a particular country is made a permanent symbol of war for all time, it is forever tarnished. Its rehabilitation is impossible; it becomes a leper among nations. The note the Queen struck - that the two countries have to look forward in reconciliation and deepened partnership around shared values while never forgetting the sufferings of war - makes more sense.  That being so, we should not let remembrance and the symbolism of the poppy be sentimentalised around a crude Euroscepticism. Nor should they be a vehicle for an unshifting mistrust and hostility to Germany as the 20th-century's warmaker, whose villainy must forever be remembered.  Rather, this is a moment for honouring the risks and sacrifices of those who fight our wars as a trigger for trying to make sure we fight as little as possible. For our generation, remembrance should not be about Germany but about Iraq, too, surely worth some silent reflection this Thursday."
10,"Simon Schama makes wonderful televisual historical essays - his  History of Britain is compelling and original. But what has become obvious in the second part of his series is that the portentous title is a misnomer. We are not watching the history of Britain. The programmes are too selective to constitute a true representation of our history. More interestingly, they raise the thorny question of whether comprehensive historical truth exists. Evidently, the BBC thinks not. I find myself in disagreement. For me, this growing realisation has been a revelation and I see why historians can get so exercised by the impact of postmodernism on historical inquiry - the view that there is no overall historical truth, just particular and varying interpretations. This cannot be right.  I shared the general admiration for the first leg of Schama's ambitious enterprise. As in his great book on the French Revolution, Citizens, Schama uses biographies and fascinating detail to tell a story that sweeps us along. He helps us feel what it was like to be at another time and place. Moreover, his capacity for simplification and focus made those early centuries come alive.These are great gifts. His history is also suffused with values which I share. In last week's programme on the British Empire - the empire of good intentions - he attacked the free-market fundamentalism which in 1840s Ireland and 1870s India led to famine and death. The British government refused to release stockpiles of food or ban food exports because it believed either act would interfere in market forces.  Tonight, he concludes by eloquently arguing that a concern for social justice and a 'bloody-minded' commitment to liberty are at the core of British values, a direct challenge to Roger Scruton's conservative view of England which holds that the essence of the country lies in the values of an Anglican Tory squire and that all else is a deviation from that happy cultural anchor. Schama is right and Scruton's elegies for a lost England are little more than sentimentality.None of that is the problem. Rather, it is that Schama's method of telling history does not allow us to establish how events are grounded in economic and social movements and in Britain's links abroad. Nobody, for example, can have read Norman Davies's  Europe and the Isles  without being forced to concede that Britain cannot be understood independently from Europe. Yet Schama's history is too episodic and personal for that. We see moments of history through the eyes of the governor-general, parliamentarian or literate wife of a district commissioner - and then we move on. The instances are connected not by some underpinning theory or logic, but by Schama's magic; they are made coherent only by his narrative and when that becomes implausible we are left with much less than we should have.I began to be uneasy about the Schama technique a fortnight ago when he told the story of Victorian Britain through the experience of its women. This was a welcome antidote to male history, with some superb vignettes, but it meant that urbanisation, the impact of science and technology and the rise of an organised, industrial working class were more or less sidelined.  It was the programme on the British Empire that crystallised my concerns. If you take his account literally, then one of the turning points in the decline of British liberalism was our reaction to the Indian Mutiny. According to him, the ridge above Delhi where the British resisted the mutineering sepoys became the central fact in late Victorian political imagination, prompting an ideological reconception of the justification for Empire and the collapse of British liberalism alike.  Up until then, according to Schama, liberalism had been able to declare itself as bringing progress, education and the benefits of free trade to the Empire and eventual self-government once the British job was complete. Afterwards, hopes of liberalism leading towards enlightened self-government were dashed because the natives could not be trusted. Thus, Disraeli reinvented Queen Victoria as Empress of India and thus Gladstone was not able to marshal a majority for Home Rule in Ireland, condemning Ireland and liberalism to their respective fates.  I loved the pictures, relished Schama's elegant commentary but gazed at the television gobsmacked. Are we to believe that the decline of British liberalism was principally because it had been unable to develop a successful progressive story of how Empire would lead seamlessly to self-government? Maybe this is part of the explanation, but it can- not be all. Small facts like the enfranchisement of the working class, the European race to grab Africa, which involved all European states directly in imperialism, the founding of the Labour Party and the character of British capitalism surely all had something to do with liberalism's travails. And didn't both Canada and Australia get dominion status as the liberal progressives in the early part of the nineteenth century had promised, so that, even in its own terms, Schama's account is flawed?  Next week's programme is even more idiosyncratic, juxtaposing the life of Winston Churchill and George Orwell as the   key to unlocking what it means to be British. The idea that when Britain was threatened both men subscribed to a deep British commitment to freedom which overrode their different loyalties to Left and Right is neat, but unsurprising. The failure of fascism and communism to develop roots in Britain is more complex than that. Common law, a tradition of political and religious tolerance and the fundamental legitimacy of our political institutions are all part of the account, but not developed. Schama seems almost as surprised as Churchill was by the scale of his landslide defeat in 1945.  Postmodern historians will doubtless argue that I am just pitting my version of history against Schama's - and that both are equally valid. Richard Evans argues in his wonderful book,  In Defence of History, that this approach is fundamentally disabling; that not only can historians search for and establish what actually happened and why, but that they must. Schama makes history accessible and fun, but it falls short of the real thing. I agree with his conclusion about what constitutes Britishness. But if true, our history should be able to prove it. The shame is that the chance has not been more fully seized."
10,"It was the summer of 1984. The terraced house in Cwm, home of a striking miner's family, was clean but modest; the cheapest furnishings. There was clearly no money coming in, but the defiance was undimmed. 'I'd rather eat grass than scab,' declared the young Welsh miner. Later that evening, we filed our film for Newsnight and headed gratefully back to London, away from the smell of rancour, poverty and despair. Many months later, Britain's bitterest industrial dispute was to end with the National Union of Mineworkers' leader Arthur Scargill walking with his men back to work, exactly 20 years ago this week. I sometimes wonder how that young miner came to terms with it all and what he's doing now. Nothing had been gained. The pits-closure programme against which the miners had been striking went forward as planned; 220,000 mining jobs were eventually to disappear. British Coal, as it became, was privatised.  Today, there are 7,000 miners working in seven pits, and if one in two of the old mining jobs has been replaced, there are still tens of thousands of men in their forties and fifties clustered in the former pit villages receiving incapacity benefit. The scars still run deep.   Scargill claims vindication; he was fighting for communities and jobs and they have gone even more quickly than he predicted. But the greater truth is that the miners' strike closed an epoch. It defined the end of the coal-based industrial economy and with it the core political philosophy of the left - that parliamentary socialists allied with the trade union battalions would confront and potentially transform capitalism through solidarity and unity.  Never achieved in the 1920s and 30s, it was not going to be attained in the changing landscape of the 1980s; the miners couldn't stay united and coal, along with manufacturing industry generally, was declining in economic importance.  It would take Scargill's epic defeat to demonstrate that truth, posing a question that too many on the left still don't confront today. If the labour movement's leadership had understood the times better, could it have redefined the left's project more cleverly and kept alive in contemporary guise some of the protections, institutions and solidarities of working-class life?  That was certainly Neil Kinnock's ambition, even if too few saw it at the time. Today's prosperity is often ascribed to the flexible labour markets that the Thatcher government entrenched after Scargill's defeat, but that's too simple, even if some labour-market flexibilities are an economic advantage. Globalisation, the rise of the knowledge economy and the extraordinary boom in house prices have all contributed to Britain's most sustained period of economic growth since the 19th century.  If the left had read the runes better, there might have been a stronger social-democratic prospectus than that available today, together with some coalition of social forces better able to back it. Leading your best men into a rout for no tangible gain was an act of supreme stupidity.  Reporting the strike for Newsnight was a watershed in my thinking. On the coaches with Yorkshire's flying pickets as they tried to shame the working Nottinghamshire miners into downing tools was, at once, enlightening and depressing; the rhetoric of working-class solidarity crumbled before your eyes.  Despite the jolliness and determination of the women at the tureens in front of the cameras, a soup kitchen is not where anyone wants to spend too much time. One abiding memory is the sheer dullness of day-to-day life in a long strike, along with the grinding poverty. You avoid this if you can.  The Thatcher government was well prepared. For three years, coal stocks had been quietly accumulated. Nottinghamshire's coal production, along with foreign imports, distributed through the non-striking rail network, meant the attrition of coal reserves at power stations was more than manageable.  The police were well organised and able to resist the flying pickets, so coal reserves could quickly move as needed to any power-generation problem areas. But for all that, Thatcher's political trump card was that Scargill so badly misread the politics of legitimacy. He wanted to rely on working-class solidarity rather than a ballot to legitimise the strike, fearful that some of the NUM's regions would not support Yorkshire, whose miners had held a ballot. Some of   them wouldn't, but by 1984, invocations of solidarity to support strikes weren't good enough - you needed votes. Without them, the NUM could never enlist the support of other unions or even keep itself united.  Twenty, even 10 years earlier, Scargill might have got away with it, but by the mid 1980s, the forces of individualisation were undermining the unity-led values of working-class Britain. Nottingham miners, dockers and rail workers, even had they been so disposed, were not prepared to lend support to a strike not legitimised by a ballot.  After the defeat, a major source of union power was irretrievably weakened and a justification for confrontational unionism was lost forever. The miners' strike also proved that the use of law in industrial relations and the regulation of union affairs in the public interest was amply justified. Both Wilson and Heath had attempted to reform trade union law but had been beaten back. With the miners defeated, Thatcher's reforms of the labour market could proceed apace and New Labour has not been minded to revoke them.  Without the evisceration of the Scargillite tendency, the Labour party would not have been able to shed itself of the old left project which, more than anything else, laid the ground for the two landslide victories of 1997 and 2001.  All that is for the good, as is the improvement in Britain's economic fortunes. Burning less coal has meant less carbon entering the atmosphere, another plus. The problem is that New Labour has shed the old without finding a new political compass, unhelped by a trade union establishment of whom far too many hanker for the exploded certainties once championed by Scargill. Most institutions suffering the reverse experienced by the miners would rethink themselves from first foundations. This the trade union movement has refused to do.  The result is that workforces have less voice than they should. More fundamentally, a key social institution that promotes the values of solidarity and fairness, and which anchors progressive politics, is too weak.  Looking back after 20 years, it is clearer that the defeat of Scargill was vital for the economy, the labour market, the environment, the public interest and progressive politics. But that didn't and shouldn't mean that capitalism should remain unchallenged, that working-class institutions should wither on the vine and that social democracy should be neutered.  Twenty years on, it is time for an honest assessment of what happened and some looking forward rather than back."
10,"The emerging consensus on Tony Blair is that he was a successful to very successful prime minister who made one fatal mistake - Iraq. He should never have allowed his Christian conscience and his anxiety to stand by America to trump the fact that he never got the second UN resolution for which he had fought in order to justify the invasion. He should have stood back and allowed the US to invade by itself. If he had he might still be looking forward to many more years of power today.But that decision had another, more fateful impact: it has made the west's dealings with China much more difficult. In the long run, the character of the Chinese state and whether it abides by the protocols of international law are going to have a much greater impact on the world than Islamist terror, which has been the focus of so much of Blair and Bush's efforts.As it is, China only just stays within the carapace of international law. Its cheap loans to African dictatorships undermine western efforts to promote better government; its desire to secure long-term oil supplies from Iran means it protects the Tehran regime in the United Nations, and it shoots down its own weather satellite without notifying the international community beforehand.This is all within its ambit as a sovereign state - as is its refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol on climate change. But as China grows ever more powerful, it will matter more and more that it accepts the framework of international law. Blair has many achievements to his name. In my view, one of the longest lasting will be the invention of a ""liberal labour"" tradition - the mirror image of liberal conservatism, and just as big a vote winner. However, it is not just Iraq that sits on the debit side of the ledger; there is the green light that his foreign policy gave China, an authoritarian, one-party state, to behave in the same unilateral way as the US and UK."
10,"When I was a child, I was perplexed by the story of the emperor with no clothes. It was so obvious that he was naked I couldn't imagine why everybody colluded in the pretence he wasn't, and why any emperor should want to sustain the pretence, anyway. The spell was always broken by somebody artless blurting out the truth, but I never understood why it fell to the artless to say what should have been obvious to all.  Last week, I was reminded of my childhood perplexities by another set of impossibilities that seem impervious to the intrusion of reality, the belief in the face of all evidence that the private sector is necessarily and always more efficient than the public sector. This emperor is also stark naked, but the Labour party and senior British officials, along with the reflex instincts of the opinion-forming classes, refuse to acknowledge what is staring them in the face. Nor do you have to be artless to draw attention to the nudity. You just have to read the business pages assiduously.   For one of the great postwar financial and industrial scandals is continuing to work itself out before our eyes. Had it happened in the public sector, it would have been proof positive of its endemic hopelessness, but so far it has attracted little outrage. It's a private sector affair, after all. The financial losses, waste and emerging cases of massive fraud in the wake of the telecoms bubble, with almost nothing to show for it in terms of technological innovation or creation of a broadband optic-fibre network, are some of the greatest calamities of industrial policy ever witnessed. The inefficiency exceeds by many multiples the losses in the former nationalised industries, yet this reality has left the conventional wisdom wholly unaffected.   The Treasury blithely continues to justify public private partnerships by loading on to the public sector assumptions that it will be hopeless in any economic endeavour, while building in parallel assumptions that the private sector will be super-efficient. Yet the recent evidence is that the equation should be the other way round, certainly in those sectors which, for compelling reasons of public interest or natural economies, have to be performed as monopolies. Last week's news that another former high-flying telecoms company, Energis, is fighting for its life together with the crisis in the National Air Traffic Services (Nats) allow for no other conclusion.   The story, hard now to believe, was that the inefficient state should not stand in the way of the efficient private sector's ambitions to exploit the digital revolution. As a result, all the old rules about telephone and cable networks being natural monopolies should be suspended. Lusty entrepreneurial companies would exploit a multiplicity of old and new networks to carry the expected boom in internet traffic. Some would use the electricity network (Energis); some would build new optic-fibre cable networks (NTL and Global Crossing); others would deploy a mixture of mobile phone and existing cable (BT).   There was an orgy of roads being dug up at the behest of the companies (local authorities were forbidden to refuse their applications, whatever the consequences of traffic gridlock), but the result would be many high-tech networks offering the consumer choice and access to cheap state-of-the-art technology. Private good; public bad.   What we have instead is a monumental dbcle and a discovery that old rules hold. The companies themselves borrowed hugely, promising their backers that their existing traffic would be followed by even more growth. But now it is emerging that some falsified their claims, especially those with US interests; blocks of alleged traffic were swapped to boost their profits, now the subject of a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.   There never was enough traffic to justify so much network building and as reality has dawned the companies are left with debt they cannot service. Global Crossing has already gone bust; Energis has been fighting off the same fate; NTL, a byword for high prices and inefficiency, is a 50-50 call; Cable and Wireless is under investigation by the US Sec... and so it goes on.   As for the acquisitions and deals made at the height of the boom, most have proved no less disastrous. KPMG Consulting estimates that more than a third of the international deals (most of them in telecoms) are now being unwound, and the chief executives involved have all moved on, doubtless handsomely enriched, as are their investment bankers. Yet the wider community is   immeasurably poorer. It is our pension-fund savings that have been ransacked; we end up having to pay high prices for poor cable service and the country, despite billions being spent, is little closer to having a national optic-fibre network than it was five years ago. Put all that into an evaluation of private sector strengths in any proposed public private partnership computation and the public sector would win hands down.   Logic dictated that we only ever needed one network. Because this, perforce, would be a monopoly, and because the public interest in it being cheap and universal is so overwhelming, necessarily it had to financed and owned by the state. Access to the network should, of course, be wholly liberalised; cable companies could transmit their programmes through it as could anybody else. It would be a public asset serving a multitude of private interests, but which private interests could not themselves build, anathema to the current conventional wisdom now proved so devastatingly wrong.   The same elementary mistake has been made over air traffic control. The partial privatisation of Nats to seven British airlines was hailed last summer as a major breakthrough. Nats under public management was plainly incapable of managing large projects as well as the private sector, so that once under private control it would be able to lower its fees charged to the airlines by 5 per cent a year because of the consequent efficiency savings. But after 11 September, Nats has plunged from projected profits into projected losses as airline traffic has fallen away. Conventional wisdom once again is shown to be wrong.   The much vaunted private sector has proved incapable of sustaining Nats' finances to allow it to continue with its investment programme upon which the safe and efficient use of British airspace depends. Neither the airlines nor the banks have put up extra cash; they are not in a position to do so because of the economic downturn. It has fallen to the Government, which alone has injected £30 million of extra cash. But on top, Nats will have to raise prices by 5 per cent a year rather than cut them. Nor is it certain, as we report in the Business Section today, that the Civil Aviation Authority will permit the price rises, in which case the Government will have to step in again.   Under public ownership, the management of British airspace was independent from the vagaries of the business cycle; under even partial private ownership, it has been indissolubly linked to it, an act of palpable madness. The safe management of our airspace, like the provision of a single, universal cable network, is a public good that cannot be privatised. Inevitably, the Government has had to intervene to secure the public interest. It is not the private sector's fault that there is a mess; it should never have been asked or allowed to assume these responsibilities in the first place. Whatever operational efficiencies it might offer are overwhelmed by the wider public interest demands of the sector in which it is operating.   The ideological belief that the private sector is inevitably better cannot be challenged, for all its nudity. In middle age, I finally understand what the child could not. Collective lunacy does descend on groups of people with no one capable of exposing the charade. The tragedy is that is what is happening to our airspace and our telecommunications companies is no fairy tale. It is for real."
3,"On the morning of polling day in the 1983 general election, I had a conversation in the local Labour committee rooms in Hackney. What do you think the result is going to be tonight, the ward secretary asked. I think the Tories will win by more than 100 seats, I replied. The ward secretary seemed taken aback. That wasn't the mood on the doorstep, he countered. In his view Labour would win by about 20. Well, when the polls closed, it soon became clear that I was right and that the Labour ward secretary was wrong. Mrs Thatcher came back with a majority of 144, Labour slumped to 28% nationwide and just escaped falling into third place.  Fast forward 14 years to the 1997 election. Another election-day conversation with another Labour official, only this time with the leader of the party. The subject was the same as before, only this time it was my turn to ask the question. What do you think the result will be? We might win by 50, he replied. More like 150, I retorted.  The purpose of retelling these anecdotes is not to boast. The truth is that my powers of prediction are no better than anyone else's. My secret on both occasions was a simple one. Unlike the people I was talking to, I consistently believed the opinion polls. The polls said Thatcher would win by a landslide in 1983, and they said the same about Blair in 1997. I merely repeated what the polls were saying.  I believed the polls then, and I believe the polls now. That is why, for example, when people ask me what I think will happen in the US presidential election, my answer is that John Kerry is winning. I say this, my abusive rightwing American email correspondents may like to note, not because I am a jerk or a pinko or because I come from a country that has lost its manhood, nor even because I want it to happen, but simply because that is currently the conclusion of most of the polls, especially in the battleground states.  Which is not, I stress, the same thing as saying that Kerry will win. Maybe he will and maybe he won't. No opinion poll is foolproof. All of them have margins of error. And none of them is ever a prediction. They are merely a necessarily approximate snapshot of the state of opinion at a point in time. And since the US election is not until November 2, and the nuances and momentum of the polls change all the time, no prediction made in August can be anything but a more or less informed guess. All you can say, right now, is that it is a close election and that Kerry is narrowly in the lead. Calling me a jerk doesn't change that, you bigots.  I accept, though, that those of us who believe the polls currently have some explaining to do on the domestic political front. This is particularly true in the combined wake of last week's Guardian-ICM poll, which found Iraq at the bottom of a list of prospective election issues, and Friday's Financial Times-Mori poll, which concluded that defence and foreign affairs were the most important issues facing the country.  Shurely shome mishtake, even good observers have said on seeing these results, among them Peter Preston, who confessed to ""plain confusion"" on these pages 24 hours ago. But I think the confusion is more apparent than real, and I also think it is important to be able to show that this is so, not solely for reasons of  amour-propre , but also even for reasons of the civic good. It would be good for our collective politics if we could stamp out the lazy conceits that the polls can't be trusted and that they can be made to support anything you want them to say.There are many variables between different polls - date, size of sample, method of contact, weighting and the rest. More than anything else, though, the results of different opinion polls depend on the questions that the pollsters ask. Confusion in; confusion out. Clarity in; clarity out. That is why the key to unravelling the ICM/Mori ""confusion"" is to be clear that they asked very different - not contradictory, just different - questions.In its poll for the Guardian, for example, ICM asked its sample: ""Now, thinking about the next election and the issues that will be important in your own decision on how to vote, which two or three of the following will be most important in your own decision on which party you will vote for?"" Respondents were offered 10 subjects, of which ""Iraq"" - that one word alone, note, not some other formulation like ""the Iraq war"" or ""Tony Blair's imperialist lies about Iraq"" or any of the almost infinite number of possible permutations - was one. Just 12% of all voters selected ""Iraq"", which came bottom of the pile topped by the NHS on 59%.   Meanwhile, going into the field that same weekend for the FT, Mori was asking its sample: ""What would you say is the most important issue facing Britain today?"", before asking them to add ""other important issues facing Britain today"". Mori's sample were not prompted with a list of issues - unlike the ICM sample - and their unprompted replies were then allocated by the pollsters into Mori's regular categories. In this latest FT poll, ""defence/foreign affairs/international terrorism"" came top for ""most important"" single issue (24%) and retained that place when ""other important issues"" were added in (38%).Does this mean that the polls are saying contradictory things? It is possible - rogue polls can happen - but very unlikely. It certainly is not happening in this instance. The key thing to notice is that the two polling organisations were simply asking different questions: ICM about the issues that would influence the way you voted at the election, but Mori about the most important issue facing the country.These two polls, far from being contradictory, are in fact compatible. It is perfectly possible to see a subject as the most important facing the country while simultaneously not giving it great importance in your decision on which way to vote. In the 80s, polls regularly showed that unemployment was deemed the most important issue facing the country, and even that Labour had the best policies for dealing with it. But that didn't mean that people voted Labour. They voted Conservative because, when it came to voting, issues like taxes and economic competence - on which the Tories had the advantage - mattered more.A similar dynamic is at work today. Foreign affairs, defence and international terrorism may indeed be the most important issue facing the nation - a pretty capacious bag that category is, by the way, containing many other issues besides Iraq. A party which could find something compelling to say about that bunch of issues would certainly have an advantage - as the Lib Dems have discovered. Even so, when it comes to the election, as ICM found, it's the same old story. Next year, most people will cast their votes because of the things that make a difference to themselves and their families - health, education and the rest of it. Which is why Labour will win. Just as the polls say they will.<B>"
3,"No one who has ever seriously believed in any cause finds it easy to criticise that same cause in public. The doubter's life can be hard, lonely and insecure. Conscience makes cowards of good people, around whom the habit of loyalty coils like a snake, difficult to shake off. In the battle between the heart and the head there is never an easy winner. Tony Blair's belief in the importance of the US is a classic example of the perils of an undifferentiated loyalty. His own current problems need to be understood with that in mind. Some of his judgments over Iraq make sense, but are not necessarily excused by the fact that Blair is engaged in a struggle with realities which threaten one of his most enduring instincts.  Blair has long held the view that British domestic politics take place downstream from the US. He thinks Bill Clinton's election in 1992, and still more his re-election in 1996, were essential preconditions for Labour's own victory a few months later in 1997. He thought that the presence of a Democratic president in the White House made Labour appear to be cutting with the grain of history, not against it.  By the same yardstick, Blair saw George Bush's election in November 2000 as a more serious challenge to Labour than most people realise. It was one of the main reasons why he was so determined to be the first foreign visitor to Bush in early 2001. By getting to the president's shoulder at Camp David, Blair aimed to squash any pre-election attempt by William Hague to position the Conservatives as the party in touch with the new America. He is just as determined to prevent Iain Duncan Smith doing the same thing now.  Since 1997, Blair's belief in the importance of America has of course widened from domestic to international politics. He seems gradually to have formulated an approach to foreign policy which sees the US as the essential nation in the settlement of global and regional issues, and which identifies the Anglo-American relationship as the necessary catalyst ensuring American global engagement rather than isolationism.  Just how much he really believes in the mystique of the so-called ""special relationship"" is a hard call, especially given the more overwhelming evidence that Blair thinks of himself as a European. But he certainly acts the part of First Buddy with conviction.  No one who heard Blair speak at a White House dinner with Clinton in 1998 would be in much doubt where his heart as well as his head lay. That evening Blair quoted the biblical remarks of Harry Hopkins, Franklin Roosevelt's emissary to Churchill, at a wartime dinner in London: ""Whither thou goest I will go, and whither thou lodgest I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. Even to the end.""  Nearly two years into the Bush administration's term, it is easy to forget that Blair sometimes had to struggle to secure US international engagement under Clinton too, and over committing US forces in Kosovo in particular. But any problems which Blair encountered with Clinton are as nothing beside those he has faced with his successor. As Frances Fitzgerald writes in a compelling essay in the current issue of the New York Review of Books: ""The Bush administration has clearly broken with the internationalist premises that have been accepted by every other administration since World War Two, with the exception of Reagan's first.""  As Fitzgerald points out, George Bush has rarely defined the goals of his administration's foreign policy. In public, he has talked mainly in vague, general terms. Depending on his audience, as in his adjoining article today, there is more or less mention of allies. But in most Bush speeches, the world is a place of threats against which US-defined solutions offer the greatest security. It was summed up in Bush's election campaign comment about threats to America: ""We're not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.""  One result is that no one, including America's allies and perhaps including Bush himself, has a very clear idea of the kind of world that Bush would really like to see beyond US shores. Perhaps he will rectify that omission when he addresses the UN today in New York. But the other result is that Bush's subordinates, led by Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, have repeatedly set the agenda in a series of steps which amount to a wholesale repudiation of any theory based on collective action and alliances.  The extreme version of this approach is summed up by the number three man at the State Department, John Bolton, who once proclaimed: ""There is no such thing as the UN. There is an international community that can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that is the US, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along.""  A parallel approach has recently allowed the Pentagon, which has systematically opposed, abrogated and binned a series of international treaties, to abandon its long-standing ""threat-based strategy"" in favour of a ""capabilities-based approach"". According to Defence Secretary Rumsfeld this means that America needs to build up its defences on land, sea, air and space ""to defend our nation against the unknown"". As Fitzgerald points out: ""For the overall defence budget, a 'capabilities-based approach' means simply that the Pentagon can ask for whatever it wants without having to justify its requests by the existence of even a potential enemy.""  This is the reality which constantly subverts Blair's attempts to portray the Bush administration as a willing partner in the new moral order that the prime minister advocated at Brighton last year. He was at it again this week, claiming to the TUC that in today's world ""internationalism is practical statesmanship"". Everywhere but in Washington, it should be added.  It is hard not to feel some sympathy with Blair's predicament. He believes in the right things. He is trying to exert an influence that needs to be exerted in pursuit of a good strategy that would make the world a safer and better place. Yet for all his efforts he gets only grief, in Washington and at home.  He gets grief because there is a profound disjunction between what he wants to believe about this administration and what is in fact the case. But this administration has trashed the rules that Blair wants to play by. Rather than face that reality head on, he pretends, in public at least, that it does not exist. It's the mistake that other loyalists in other causes have made down the years. Like them, Blair faces a choice between heart and head, and between loyalty and truth. Like them, he risks allowing excess loyalty and insufficient clarity to make the wrong call.  < AA >"
3,"The books used to talk about how the American Republican party was really two parties. The first of them was very decent and sometimes very grand indeed, and could answer truthfully to the term compassionate conservative. It was the party of Theodore Roosevelt and Nelson Rockefeller. The second party was decent too, in its way, but it was decidedly not so grand as the first. It was the party of people like Dwight Eisenhower and, stretching a point, Richard Nixon. Identifiable traces of these two mid-20th century parties, particularly the latter, still live on in George Bush's Republican party of 2004. But they survive there on sufferance, in a transformed party. Even so, you could argue that the Republicans of today are still based on a kind of alliance, though the new one bears no relation to the old. The first arm, which has all of the power and most of the dynamism, is the religious conservative activist party that gathered in Madison Square Garden this week to acclaim Bush, now himself the de facto leader of the religious right. The second, still necessary to the first for purely electoral reasons, consists of people who vote Republican in the belief that the party is as nice as it portrays itself, when in fact it is no such thing.  One needs to beware of applying the political mores of one culture to those of another. Even so, there was no mistaking the sheer aggressiveness of the Republicans this week. This quality showed above all in the treatment reserved for John Kerry, who was subjected to a four-day stream of orches trated personal insult that makes British politics appear truly gentlemanly by comparison. Nothing that happens in a convention hall happens without the party managers' approval. Every placard they wave has been handed out by party officials a few minutes before. So the sudden outbreak of delegates wearing sticking plasters with Purple Hearts on them - implying that Kerry exaggerated his Vietnam wounds in order to win his medals - could hardly have been an unofficial move either, and stands in marked contrast to earlier denials by the Bush campaign that it was promoting the apparently ""non-partisan"" anti-Kerry moves by rightwing Vietnam veterans.  Of course, it was not an unofficial move at all. What the delegates expressed with their nasty stickers, the party's leaders actually said, just as nastily, from the platform. Speech after speech besmirched Kerry's military record - a record which he had placed at the centre of his own campaign in an explicit bid for electoral credibility both as a man and as a potential president - none more brutally than the Georgia Democratic senator Zell Miller, who cast Kerry as ""wrong, weak and wobbly"" and as a man with a ""yes-no-maybe"" approach to the war on terrorism.  In a truly revealing turn of events, after years in which rightwing America has endlessly celebrated the unquiet Vietnam veterans as a betrayed generation of real male patriots, mainstream Republican demonology has now cast Kerry as a man whose preoccupation with his own exploits in Vietnam make him fundamentally unreliable both as man and potential leader. The fact that rightwing America can so shamelessly taunt Kerry in this way, led by a non-combatant president who refuses to condemn the negative campaign and by a vice-president who fanned the flames in his own speech this week (""I had other priorities"" is how Cheney icily describes his own Vietnam years) is a reminder that what is crucially important to Republicans is not, as they like to say, the tradition of armed service but, in reality, their claim to exclusive ownership of the politics of US defence, security and war.  Throughout the week, it goes almost without saying, there was not a single critical reference to the American military, not even in relation to Abu Ghraib. Bush himself probably saw no element of irony in his closing encomium of ""our military which finds a way, or makes one"". Such self-confidence reminds us how much more vicious American politics since 9/11 would have been if Al Gore had been in the White House when the hijacked planes were flown into the World Trade Centre. Would the Republicans have rallied behind Gore as the Democrats rallied behind Bush that day? Not a chance. Within days they would have begun to blame Bill Clinton for the attack on America. Some of them, indeed, do so anyway. Browsing through a   New York Barnes and Noble bookstore the other day I encountered titles like ""Losing Bin Laden: How Bill Clinton's Failures Unleashed Global Terror"", ""Dereliction of Duty: The Eyewitness Account of How Bill Clinton compromised American's National Security"" or ""Intelligence Failure: How Clinton's National Security Policy Set the Stage for 9/11"".  For such people, the mere act of imagining John Kerry as their duly elected ""commander-in-chief"" is offensive. Miller and others have said as much. Cheney, in the speech of great ruthlessness, went further than most. And again, all this provides a glimpse of the vengeful and vindictive way that a defeated Republican party might be tempted to treat a President Kerry. The Republican party today is not at ease in any settlement other than one whose terms it has dictated. You can already sense the impeachment reflex beginning to take on life.  In some ways it is as though the modern Republican party has become the political expression of the ""misplaced power"" of the military-industrial complex against which Eisenhower famously warned as he left the White House in 1961.  In any other political culture, you would characterise the Republicans as a militarist party, and in that context it would be perverse not to reflect upon whether this central development in American life did not have far more sinister implications, not least when so many references to the war on terror this week have been accompanied   by testosterone-fuelled chants of ""U-S-A, U-S-A"".  Yet the Republican party which Bush leads should really be seen as the party that tries to unite the military-industrial and religious imperatives in American life. If Bush was careful this week not to take the attacks on Kerry too far, he was much less restrained in his meticulous willingness to tick each of the boxes that matter to the religious party he now leads.  But it was not merely his comments about the unborn child and gay marriage that marked this key role. Time and again Bush also deployed his well-established ""double-coding"" technique, dotting his speech with remarks which may not sound to the uninitiated as though they have a Christian conservative meaning, but which initiates will easily read differently.  ""We must win this culture war,"" the Republican senator Sam Brownback told a private Family, Faith and Freedom rally in New York this week. For many in Bush's party, this is now the central task of a second term. ""We ask that you continue to provide strength to President Bush and the first family,"" intoned the blessing with which the final convention evening began. ""Guide, protect, and grant wisdom to him as he leads America and the world against the forces of evil ... And father, we pray your will is accomplished in this convention and throughout this great country."" Much of what was said in Madison Square Garden this week was a masterpiece of Orwellian double-speak. A few things, on the other hand, meant exactly what they said."
3,"In Vasily Grossman's remarkable novel Life and Fate, there is a powerful scene in which two Bolsheviks encounter one another as prisoners in one of Stalin's labour camps in 1942. The younger Bolshevik, Abarchuk, who is convinced he is there in error, remains a believer in the cause; but his older mentor, Magar, has gained wisdom through experience. When the two comrades snatch what turns out to be their final conversation, Magar looks around the camp and distils their years of revolutionary experience in words of terrible simplicity and force. ""We made a mistake,"" he tells Abarchuk. ""And this is what our mistake has led to.""It has become increasingly hard for a truthful person not to apply those same words to the situation facing the US and Britain in Iraq. It is not Stalin's Russia and Bush's Iraq that are the same, of course. It is the dreadful clarity of Magar's conclusion about the way events can evolve. In Iraq we too made a mistake. Adapting a comment by the 19th-century diplomat Talleyrand, I see Britain's role in the invasion not as a crime, but as an error - and the scenes of desecration and murder this week across Iraq are what our mistake has led to.Even if you supported the invasion - and I have always accepted that there were principled and respectable grounds for doing so - this simply was not what you expected, much less wanted, to see. No country can survive indefinitely with the level of violence, insecurity and - much less widely reported but far more widely experienced - continuing material discomfort that has now become the everyday reality in many parts of Iraq.The blowing up of the al-Askari shrine in Samarra on Wednesday was an act of pitiless destruction and malign calculation - as wickedly provocative to Iraqi Shias as the assault on the twin towers on 9/11 was to Americans. With at least 130 Sunnis killed since Wednesday, Shia leaders vacillating over calls for restraint, inter-party talks abandoned and three central provinces under daytime curfew, the provocation has already come dangerously close to achieving its goal.But we need to be careful not to rush fences here. There has been much talk this week about Iraq drifting into civil war. Such talk makes good headlines that reflect the seriousness of the situation. They do not, one senses, reflect the more complex reality that few of us can truly know, because it is so desperately hard and dangerous to report on what is happening outside the Baghdad Green Zone. A wider point of caution must also be considered. Drifts towards civil war can be long or short. There is no law of history that says they always end in conflict. Drifts are like declines and rises - always relative, rarely absolute - as Northern Ireland reminds us.The situation in Iraq, in other words, is very serious. But the only question worth asking about it is not how we got there but where we go from here. The clear answer - which is also, as it happens, the government's unacknowledged answer - is that we should get out in as good order as possible, as soon as possible, leaving Iraq with its best chance in all the circumstances. That doesn't necessarily mean quitting immediately. But it does mean planning to leave and then, over time, leaving. And there are more options to this than the week's events might imply.Violence is spreading, but it remains, relatively speaking, localised. The institutions of civil society undoubtedly differ in different parts of Iraq but, for all their weakness, they remain in place and continue to function. There is an elected Iraqi assembly and president. Dialogue is still taking place about forming a unitary government. Religious leaders are mainly a force for restraint. Most Iraqi security forces continue to be trained. Even the invasion forces, for all their caged impotence, can claim to have a general restraining influence - judged by the widespread assumption that violence would rapidly intensify if they were to take the next plane out. The US, in particular, continues to exert some restraining political and financial influence, even if its military influence is minimal.Whether this adds up to a critical mass of stabilising elements adequate to hold the shaking line against the forces of violence over the necessary period is a tough call. This week has undoubtedly made the task more difficult, and the invasion's apologists should not pretend otherwise. Tony Blair, at his press conference this week, talked as though everything is unchanged. But it isn't.Even the Iraqi president's man talked yesterday about the volatility, sensitivity and seriousness of the situation, while Britain's former post-invasion Baghdad representative Sir Jeremy Greenstock plundered his thesaurus for words that diplomats rarely deploy, such as damaging, delicate, fragile and unpleasant.So where do we go from here? In his book on America and Iraq, The Assassins' Gate, the New Yorker journalist George Packer observes at one point that too much American (and other) discussion about Iraq policy takes place in rigid moulds set by the second world war (the western ""we will never surrender"" paradigm) or by Vietnam (the ""we will never win"" alternative). Iraq, he insists, ought always to have been judged in its own terms, rather than being an arena for a defiant or fatalistic re-enactment of either of these earlier conflicts.That is a wise view that opponents and supporters of the war should both heed. If Packer is right then there may remain a working chance of a tolerably orderly outcome in Iraq in line with the experience since 2003, in which the violence recedes from this week's levels, the political talks reach agreement on a power-sharing government, and the invasion countries are able to draw down troop deployments before the US midterm elections, leaving Iraq to an uncertain but not inevitably disastrous future. It certainly wouldn't be the catharsis of Berlin 1945 revisited, but it wouldn't be the trauma of Saigon 1975 revisited either.This would be the best, or at any rate the least worst, outcome now. It is also, pretty obviously, the unacknowledged London and even Washington agenda. Ambitions have been scaled back. We don't want to be there any longer than we have to be. The Iraq war is over and Iran is the winner. Iraq's neighbours have an interest in making it happen. But it's time that the west's political leaders levelled with their voters about where things stand. We didn't exactly win. We didn't exactly lose either. We just made a mistake. And this is what our mistake has led to."
3,"It is a compelling measure of the personal and political impact made by the long reign of John Paul II - to say nothing of the changed nature of British public life during his 27 years as Bishop of Rome - that the death of the pontiff this weekend should have triggered such turmoil for the establishment of this notably un-Catholic country. The funeral of a pope, let us be clear, has never until now been the sort of event deemed to require the attendance of the British prime minister - or even of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The late Lord Callaghan, who was premier when the previous two Popes died in quick succession in 1978, attended neither of their funerals. Nor did anyone at the time think it remarkable that he chose not to go. The more so when not even Dr Donald Coggan, Cantuar of that time, saw it as an essential duty to attend the funeral of John Paul I either.  This time, as yesterday's extraordinary flurry of hasty rearrangements showed, the assumptions could not be more different. No British prime minister, as far as I know, has ever attended a papal funeral, but Tony Blair will have been absolutely determined to be in St Peter's on Friday. Even more striking was the similar instinct in Lambeth Palace, where Dr Rowan Williams was yesterday reported to believe that, offered a choice between officiating at the royal wedding in Windsor or attending the papal requiem in Rome, Rome would win every time.  The immediate dilemma was caused by the unexpected coincidence of the papal funeral being arranged for the day of the remarriage of the Prince of Wales. But this upmarket diary clash conceals something deeper and even less easily resolved, a dilemma about how seriously to take our major national institutions at a time when they are losing public credibility and confidence.  As the first celebrity Pope, John Paul did for the papacy what Lady Di did for the royal family, giving it a superficial familiarity to millions that was quite unlike anything that previous generations had experienced. Friday's will be a celebrity funeral, as well as a religious event, and the world leaders now heading for Rome want nothing more complicated than to be associated with it. That is why George Bush is heading across the Atlantic for this week's event, while in 1978 the no less religious Jimmy Carter preferred to send his mother to John Paul I's requiem.  Even so, it is hard not to catch one's breath at the rupture with national history that all this represents. Ours is still, after all, legally established as a Protestant nation. Until very recently the mere idea that a prime minister or the head of the Anglican church might have any kind of dialogue with Rome - never mind rearrange the next Protestant king's wedding to suit the cardinals in Rome - would have been regarded as close to treason. Catholicism, in its time, was as anathema to the British state as communism was in a later era. Five centuries ago we broke with Rome so that a king could remarry. Today our re-embrace of Rome means that a future king's remarriage has to be postponed.  Yet this does not mean that 21st-century Britain is trying to find its way back into the Roman Catholic fold. There is no evidence of that - in spite of the striking number of prominent Catholics on the list of those attending the Vespers in Westminster Cathedral last night. The Roman church's teachings - and particularly those of the late Pope - on subjects such as birth control, homosexuality and women priests are too widely resisted for such a possibility.  The real dynamic behind this new pragmatic ecumenism towards Catholicism comes from the severe modern erosion of commitment and confidence in the national institutions handed down to us by history, notably by the Reformation and the Glorious Revolution. Legislation, such as the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 and of Settlement in 1701, has bequeathed us an established church, a limited monarchy and a system of parliamentary government. But the whole edifice is now in need of some serious repair work.  Yesterday the competing demands of a prince, a pope and a prime minister seemed to be turning into a constitutional version of the scissors-paper-stone game. Why does a papal funeral require a premier to postpone a dissolution of parliament? Or the heir to the throne to defer his marriage? Is it more important for the Archbishop of Canterbury to conduct a royal wedding or to attend the obsequies in Rome? Could the princely nuptials be postponed to the middle of a general election campaign? It is impossible to answer such questions without priorities.  There are three ways of dealing with delicate and uncertain constitutional relationships of this kind. The first is to do things by the rules. Yet if Britain had been going by the rules, there would have been no question where the duty of the prime minister and the archbishop lay. They would have put the remarriage of the Prince of Wales first and ignored the coincidence of the funeral in Rome. Because the rules are an anachronism, they did the opposite.  The second is to make it up as you go along. This is essentially what the advisers to the prince, the premier and the primate are all doing. They may be responsible for ensuring that the rules are maintained, but in the final analysis they too are in awe of John Paul's celebrity and are keen to be popular. So they juggle the pieces in order to have the best of both worlds - joining the big event at the Vatican, then tidying up the business at Windsor, leaving the stage free for the launch of the general election.  There is, though, a third way. As this week shows, our constitutional relationships are currently in a rare muddle. We are reduced to picking and mixing among the elements of the inherited constitutional settlement, rather than honouring and celebrating it as a whole with indiscriminate confidence, as we should. We improvise inconsistently. This week our established leaders will do honour to Catholicism on Friday, then perpetuate Catholicism's subordination on Saturday.  As a result we have an Act of Settlement which simultaneously contains provisions which are inspiring - such as the independence of the judiciary - and others which are absurd - like the bans on Catholic monarchs or consorts. If there is one over-arching lesson for Britain from the swirling political, religious and constitutional issues of the moment it is surely that we need a new Act of Settlement, one which defines the proper spheres and relationships of the crown, the government, the parliament, the judiciary, the component peoples and their faiths in 21st- rather than 18th-century terms. And if we want to decide whether Charles should be king or Camilla should be queen, we can do that at the same time too, much as they did when they specified the succession to Queen Anne in 1701."
3,"Among the half a million demonstrators peacefully thronging the streets of Manhattan on Sunday, the verdict against George Bush was instantly familiar to any visiting European. He's dumb, he's dangerous, he's divisive - and more: he's a warmonger, a liar, a threat to liberty, a despoiler of the planet, an agent of the corporations. Though the march was a quintessential New York event - extrovert, exhibitionist and (the bit that foreigners often overlook) earnest - it was also one that could have taken place in dozens of other great cities across the world. In the face of such anger, it is hard not to be both awed and anxious. Awed because the numbers on the streets were simply huge. Yet anxious because it was another reminder of the ways in which this is becoming an ever more deeply divided society. I used to think angry certainty could not get any more intense than that which the American right levelled at Clinton. But the angry certainty directed against Bush from the left now comfortably exceeds anything from the Clinton years. That's one of the reasons this is such a vicious election.  We need, though, to be careful not to be transfixed by the polarisation and to see beyond and around it. I yield to no one in my belief that it will be for the good of America and of the world - not to mention the Labour government - if John Kerry defeats Bush in November. I also think that it may happen. At the same time, however, I think that we need to be careful not to luxuriate in an image of Bush so fixedly critical and inflexibly condescending that we cannot even ask ourselves why he might win again, let alone see why he might be a politician from whom others may also have something to learn.  The most obvious reason for taking Bush more seriously is a simple one: he may be president of the US for the next four years. But we also need to ask ourselves why that may happen, if it does. If it is so blindingly obvious to the rest of the world that Bush is dumb, dangerous and the rest of it, how is it that millions of intelligent and perfectly decent people in the US see it so differently? Is it simply that they don't get it? Or that they have been brainwashed? Or that they are neither intelligent nor decent after all?  These hardly stand up as satisfactory explanations. The questions, though, remain and they are desperately important. If Bush wins, maybe we need to be more attentive to the things that are different - not necessarily better or worse, just different - about America. If Bush wins, and perhaps even if he narrowly loses, we need to grasp why the centre of gravity in American political life is as far to the right as it now is. At the very least, if America is now answering to its own individual drum and not to one that we can all hear clearly, that has implications for us as well as them.  Don't make the mistake of thinking that this whole phenomenon of American exceptionalism can be explained away by 9/11. Writers like Seymour Martin Lipset have tried for years to prise out the truth about issues like why American men consistently vote to the right of American women, when the reverse gender gap applies in most other industrial democracies. Now, thanks in no small part to Bush's successes, a new generation of writers is making a renewed attempt to understand why America is different.  Two new books from different ends of the political spectrum combine to illustrate this point. From the left, Thomas Frank's What's the Matter with America? - originally published in America as What's the Matter with Kansas? - raises hell about US conservatism. While passing itself off as the foe of the elite, it has managed to enlist millions of average-income voters, mainly white and disproportionately male, as willing foot soldiers of a movement which consistently promotes the interests of the wealthy at the expense of those of these self-same average-income voters - who nevertheless continue to support it.  Meanwhile, from the other side of the tracks, in The Right Nation, the Economist journalists John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge gaze with wonder at how American conservatism has moved from being an insurgent force under Barry Goldwater 40 years ago to become easily the most dominant and most dynamic political movement in modern America, rolling back the welfare state, entrenching the gun culture, assaulting the right to abortion and, under Bush's leadership, doing all the rest of the things that so easily send a shiver down the European spine.  Yet, as the authors of The Right Nation point out, it is not good enough to dismiss Bush as an unthinking and unchanging inheritor of the anti-government traditions embodied by Goldwater and, more recently, by Newt Gingrich. For, along with his revolution in foreign policy, his conservative social agenda and his tax cuts - the things against which the protesters mostly marched in Manhattan - Bush has also been doing something which few, including perhaps Bush himself, would have predicted back in 2000. He has been reinventing big government.  That the collapse of the socialist era would mean big changes for leftwing parties is no longer disputed, save among a dwindling band of true believers. That the collapse would necessitate a rethinking of the role of rightwing parties has been less obvious. Yet there are those who argue that Bush, without perhaps necessarily intending to, is inching towards a new ""big government conservative"" political model. This apparently contradictory idea is not as daft as it may seem.  Certainly the facts are impressive. No president since Lyndon Johnson has increased discretionary government spending as much. Bush has increased education spending by 75%, has presided over the biggest increase in the Medicare health programme for the elderly since its foundation, and claims to have increased spending on police, fire and ambulance services sixfold. More people now work for the US government than at any other time in history.  Does this add up to a coherent new conservatism that could dominate US politics for the next generation and which, in some form or other, may dominate our politics, too? Not even Bush's greatest apologists quite make that claim yet. But if he wins in November they surely will. It certainly all bears study and attention. Bush may not be as clever as Michael Howard, but if Bush keeps on winning elections, then he may have something more durable to offer the Conservatives.  We ought at least to do the millions of Bush voters the courtesy of trying to understand why they see so many things so differently. And at the same time we ought to pay Bush the respect of trying to understand what he is doing right, not just in purely vote-winning terms, but possibly even more broadly. Bush-bashing has its place. But this might be a good week for liberals and progressives to start raising their game a bit."
3,"It says something about the fashions of intellectual life that there are more books in print these days about the historian AJP Taylor than by him. But if ever it was in the collective public interest for a book to be urgently reprinted, because it can speak so directly to our present discontents, then that book is Taylor's The Troublemakers. Subtitled Dissent over British Foreign Policy 1792-1939, the book was Taylor's own favourite from his output. Based on his Ford lectures at Oxford University in 1956, the unerring coherence of The Troublemakers is never in doubt and was never more relevant than today, nearly half a century later. The Troublemakers leaves an infinitely sharper and brighter imprint in the mind than most of the thousands of history books that have been written in the subsequent half-century, about which it can truly be said that they say more and more about less and less. No one could possibly say that about Taylor's book.  The Troublemakers is, in one sense, an apologia on behalf of Taylor's own lifetime of radical iconoclasm about international affairs. It was an iconoclasm which he practised as well as preached, as a leading early member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an opponent of Suez and frequently as a defender of the Soviet rather than the American stance in successive cold war confrontations. Taylor was regularly mocked by the foreign policy establishment, for example, for repeatedly argu ing that the Soviet Union had no intention of invading western Europe. But in the end he was probably more right than his critics.  The Troublemakers also tells a national story - and it is a story that has not ended yet. For every national tradition, Taylor argued, there is a national countertradition, and the dissenting tradition in foreign policy is one of the most sustained countertraditions of them all.  Taylor mined a rich mother lode of anti-war, anti-imperial, anti-Whitehall dissent in British public life through some of the most bellicose eras of modern history, from the French revolution to the outbreak of the second world war. His heroes are sometimes famous men, like Gladstone, more often half-forgotten men, like John Bright and occasionally wholly forgotten ones like David Urquhart or HN Brailsford. Throughout, though, there is an essential message: that there is a radically different way of defining the British national interest from the one embraced by governments down the ages - and that it is one which can embrace both the traditional right and the traditional left.  Most of the time, the challenges mounted by the troublemakers have tended to be quixotic, marginal and unsuccessful. But not invariably. At certain moments, the troublemakers understand more clearly than anyone else what needs to be said and done. The climax of Taylor's book marks such a moment. It comes on the evening of September 2 1939, when   Neville Chamberlain sat down, in a shocked chamber and without a single cheer, after giving the Commons his latest - and, as it turned out, his last - report on his efforts to strike a deal with Hitler over the invasion of Poland.  As Chamberlain took his seat, the acting leader of the Labour party, Arthur Greenwood, rose to reply. As he did so, there were mutterings of encouragement to Greenwood from both sides, and a shout, traditionally attributed to Leo Amery, came from the restive Conservative benches. Taylor treated that shout as the apotheosis of the ""troublemaking"" tradition -the moment when the outsiders reclaimed the moral initiative from the insiders and saved the nation from its leaders. Today, Amery's words have a power which vaults across the decades to another generation as it stands on the eve of another war: ""Speak for England, Arthur!""  History never exactly repeats itself, and the supporters of peace and war in this generation are interestingly transposed today compared with their predecessors in 1939. But we are once again a country desperately in need of a clear, temperate voice at a time of unmistakable international crisis. Rarely has it seemed more important in recent years for the national interest on the world stage to be properly articulated and clearly acted upon. And yet if Tony Blair no longer speaks for England - or, more properly, Britain - then who does?  Even now, it may seem unfair to write Blair so peremptorily out of the script. He still speaks for many more people - and in more subtle ways - than those who rush to label this as ""the Bush-Blair war"" ever acknowledge. He has, in his way, been pursuing a necessary, often lonely, frequently unrewarding and at times even heroic effort to prevent a dangerous American war against a dangerous Iraq. He is - or was - right to try to contain the administration that rules the US, just as he is also right to seek to contain the threat from Saddam Hussein.   Nor is Blair's frequently stated desire for Britain to have the best of both worlds - European influence and transatlantic influence - either unprincipled or tactically wrong. That policy made enormous sense before September 11, when Blair invoked it to try to head off the Bush administration's early signs of multilateral disengagement. But it has been tested to destruction since September 11. It can no longer bear the weight that the combination of the danger from terrorism and the momentum of the Bush administration's response now place on it. Bush has forced Blair to choose between Europe and the US, and Blair cannot avoid the tragic choice.  That is why this weekend's Blair visit to Bush at Camp David could be pivotal in our modern nationhood. Driven by a combination of anger, oil, domestic electoral calculation, and the awesome re-energisation of what Dwight Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex, the Americans have got themselves over-exposed on Iraq. By overcommitting militarily so hastily, Bush is now a step away from having to go to war largely to save his own face. War with Iraq is not even in Americas interests, never mind Britain's.  In theory this could be seen as a great opportunity for Blair. In theory, this weekend is the moment when Blair can say to Bush that our national interest is at odds with America's war. In theory, that refusal could matter. In theory, it is even the moment when Blair could start to make the great overdue turn towards Europe to which Bush has finally forced him.  In practice, none of these things is going to happen. Tragically, when Blair says he positively wants America to act this way, he seems to be saying what he believes. Tragically, he cannot contemplate saying no to the US, even when Bush has pushed him to it. That is why we are again at a ""speak for England"" moment. Yet even AJP Taylor would have been hard put to explain how the man who currently speaks for England is, of all unlikely people, Jacques Chirac.  <B>"
3,"Back in February, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, did one of those things that help to mark him as one of the most interesting politicians of our age and continent. En route from Berlin for talks in Moscow with Vladimir Putin, Fischer stopped off for the first time in his life in the Baltic city that was once Knigsberg and is for now Kaliningrad. He did so to mark the 200th anniversary of the death of the city's most famous son, laying a wreath and delivering an oration at the grave of Immanuel Kant. Clutching his dog-eared copy of The Critique of Pure Reason, Fischer told his audience of diplomats and philosophers how Kant, along with Hegel and Marx, remained one of his own greatest influences. An understanding of law and morality as the basis of the rational world was Kant's continuing legacy to the present, he argued. Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, which envisages a global association of republics, could even be seen as a pointer towards the creation of the UN, Fischer suggested.  It is impossible to imagine many circumstances in which one of Britain's past or current ministers would reflect on the continuing influence and relevance of one our own great philosophers. Jack Straw, Fischer's opposite number, is a serious thinker, but he will not be taking a leaf out of the German foreign minister's book on Thursday to deliver a graveside tribute on the 300th anniversary of the death of John Locke.   Very few people appear to make the pilgrimage to Locke's last resting place in a tomb against the church wall at High Laver in west Essex. When I went to pay my respects there last weekend, I had the church and his memorial to myself. No one had signed the visitors' book for nearly two weeks. Locke's significance as a guiding spirit of the US constitution is duly marked by a church plaque erected by American admirers in 1957. But his importance in his own country is not acknowledged in any way. This neglect seems somehow bleakly appropriate of our current uncertainties.  Locke certainly has his faults, and his critics, and it is important not to romanticise him. There is confusion, self-contradiction and much that is unresolved in his thinking. He was a man of the 17th century, and his advocacy of tolerance did not extend to Catholics or to atheists. His civil society of free, equal and rational men essentially excluded women and the labouring poor. Yet you do not have to be an enthusiast for Locke to recognise the sheer scale of his contribution to British life or his central position at the fountainhead of so much that came later.  Indeed, it is hard to think of anything important about societies in general, and our own in particular, on which Locke did not have something pertinent and lasting to say. He is the essential philosopher of consensual constitutional government, the key expounder of the notions of the social contract, the sovereignty of the people, majority rule, minority rights and the separation of powers. He is our leading defender of individual civil liberty, the greatest advocate in our history of religious and civic tolerance, and the first proponent of progressive educational methods, as well as the principal godfather of all those attitudes of common sense, reasonableness, kindness and politeness that later eras have so often thought of as essentially British.  So if anyone deserves to be the object of serious civic commemoration or reflection in Britain, then Locke surely qualifies. Yet this week's notable anniversary will pass here almost without notice. Elsewhere the interest is somewhat greater. Locke is generally taken more seriously in America, where a crude Lockean view of the contract between the individual (sovereign) and government (limited) remains widely held. Yet he has become a prophet without much honour in his homeland, even though he is the principal intellectual begetter of the 1688 constitutional settlement, which he did so much to legitimate and which has lasted from his day to ours.  I am not arguing for large-scale celebrations, renaming of streets, a special issue of postage stamps or even an anniversary lecture by Simon Schama on the BBC, although none of these would be unwelcome. But it seems more than a mere oversight that we do not even consider doing any of these things. There are, of course, special reasons why Germans should wish to recall and connect with Kant. But other European countries also have explicit places and rituals of honour for their own great thinkers and writers. Britain is unusually negligent in this respect, especially considering our riches and our strong, if conflicted, sense of national identity. So one has to wonder: why?  The big answer is surely that we gradually lost sight of the liberalism of which Locke has such a large claim to be the source. And lost confidence in it too. A hundred years ago, Locke's position at the head of a still vibrant British liberal tradition seemed utterly secure. Since then, the liberal tradition has declined, faltered, and has even seemed to have spent itself. For much of the 20th century, socialism appeared to be the philosophy and programme of the future, a stronger weapon to achieve wider social justice. In those circumstances, Locke inevitably appeared a more distant and less relevant figure. More radical and obscure 17th-century icons, like the Digger Gerrard Winstanley and the Leveller Thomas Rainborough, seemed to have more to say to our times.  But socialism has failed. Even the era of the labour movement is passing inexorably away. We inhabit a world that has passed through the industrial socialist era and is emerging on the other side of it, dazed, disorientated and in search of new and more relevant signposts towards modern social justice and liberty. Capitalism has won the economic battle, albeit in a form that no 19th-century capitalist would easily recognise. Socialism has become a religion not a programme. And liberalism, which to socialists seemed for so long to be merely temporising and cowardly, has outlasted socialism.  Which is why, in turn, it is time to return to Locke and the tradition at whose head he still stands. Liberalism without social justice is not a political programme in the democratic age. But nor, we should have learned from the 20th-century experience, is social justice without liberalism. The things that Locke thought were important - government by consent, the parliamentary system, civil liberty, freedom of thought and religion, the rights of minorities, an education that is more than functional, the rule of law - have never seemed more modern than they do today. Disregard for these principles has marked every instance of the failed socialist experiment. And it is also perhaps the most lasting - and least excusable - of all New Labour's failings too. To the politics of the future, as of so much else, Locke still holds the key."
3,"Readers may be aware that the left has stormed to power in three memorable and widely separated electoral landslides since the Victorian era. They are, in reverse chronological order, the New Labour triumph of 1997 (repeated in 2001), the postwar Labour landslide of 1945, and the Liberal landslide of 1906. They were won, readers may also recall, under the respective leaderships of Tony Blair, Clement Attlee and, er, someone else. The name of this third electoral magician of the left? Step forward this country's forgotten radical prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.It is a hundred years ago next month since CB, as everyone always called him, began the Liberal party's longest, greatest and, as it transpired, final era in government, an era that would last in one form or another until the fall of the Lloyd George coalition in October 1922, nearly 17 years later. Not bad, 17 years. It is a span of office as yet unmatched by any other British government of the left - twice the lifetime of New Labour's reign so far. And, while it is rightly associated most of all with the two names of Asquith and Lloyd George, its first and greatest victory - the January 1906 election that the Liberals called as soon as they took office - was won not by either of them but by Campbell-Bannerman.I like the sound of Campbell-Bannerman. He was, wrote Margot Asquith, ""essentially a bon vivant, a boulevardier and a humorist"" - and of how many prime ministers since Disraeli can those attractive words be said? According to his only late-20th-century biographer, John Wilson, CB was ""an unusual person to emerge as the leader of a great political party, or to be a politician at all, for he was easy-going, had little ambition and inclined to let well alone"". He kept politics and government in proportion. No one ever accused CB of being a workaholic. And unlike so many other politicians whose personalities have been warped by grievance and bitterness, he was never a grudge-bearer.But don't be misled by all this into dismissing him as nothing more than a lazy pragmatist. Campbell-Bannerman may not have been an intellectual, but he knew what he fought for and he loved what he knew. His politics were as deeply and thoroughly imprinted on him as his lifelong love of Balzac and Flaubert. CB's Liberalism was real, straightforward and unshakable. ""What is Liberalism?"" he asked in a speech of 1898, before coming up with an answer that, while not exactly Noam Chomsky, nevertheless still wears pretty well, both in principles and language, more than a century later:""I should say it means the acknowledgment in practical life of the truth that men are best governed who govern themselves; that the general sense of mankind, if left alone, will make for righteousness; that artificial privileges and restraints upon freedom, so far as they are not required in the interests of the community, are hurtful; and that the laws, while, of course, they cannot equalise conditions, can at least avoid aggravating inequalities, and ought to have for their object the securing to every man the best chance he can have of a good and useful life.""I don't just warm to Campbell-Bannerman. I admire him. I admire him because, when this broad, inclusive progressivism was put to the test by a seriously divisive issue, he did not bend with the wind but made the right and principled call. Nowhere was this more true than over the Boer war, on which the Liberals - then in opposition - came close to rupture, with much of the party hierarchy under Lord Rosebery supporting the war while the radicals opposed it. As newly elected leader, CB tried to steer a middle course, but in the end it was he who in 1901 made the most important anti-war speech of the era, denouncing the Salisbury government for using ""methods of barbarism"" to pursue the campaign against the Boers.Admirable too was his highly pragmatic but radical way of governing. The most important example of this was his embrace of the emerging Labour party. CB liked Labour people, agreed with their principal grievances and, within months of taking office in 1906, delivered them the 1906 Trades Disputes Act. Fighting off efforts led by Asquith to water the legislation down, Campbell-Bannerman pushed a much stronger bill through the cabinet which became the cornerstone of 20th-century labour law.Admirable above all was his cool political touch. CB led his party from the centre, not the extremes, rebuilding it to sweep from the bad defeat of 1900 to the massive win of 1906. He took his party from a Tory majority of 134 to a Liberal one of 130, one of the largest general election swings of all time. He did it by concentrating on his opponents' weaknesses - the divisive protectionist tariff campaign - while not exaggerating what the Liberals could achieve. Most of his colleagues thought he was wrong; the result proved him triumphantly right.In office, the Campbell-Bannerman government outperformed expectations - and how many radical governments can make that claim? Had it not been for the Tory majority in the House of Lords, CB would have accomplished education reform and abolition of the multiple franchise - as well as trade union law reform - by the end of his first year in office. As it was, his ministers - Haldane on the army, Lloyd George on merchant shipping - showed themselves real reformers.All political careers end in failure, wrote Enoch Powell in a famous remark in an essay about Joseph Chamberlain. David Blunkett must be reflecting on the truth of that this weekend. But Powell's remark was not true of CB, except in the sense that Campbell-Bannerman's political career ended with his death in Downing Street in early 1908, a few days after he had resigned the premiership on his deathbed in favour of Asquith. If that isn't going out at the top, what is?Yet the gods have had an even crueller fate than failure in store for Campbell-Bannerman: oblivion. Andrew Bonar Law once vied with CB for prime ministerial obscurity, until the late Robert Blake rescued him from neglect with a biography entitled The Unknown Prime Minister. Perhaps, in a few decades' time, Alec Douglas-Home will have receded far enough into the historical shadows to be even more forgotten by future generations. Until then, sadly and most unjustly, the palm of being our unknown prime minister remains with the admirable and unjustly neglected Henry Campbell-Bannerman."
3,"A year or so ago, I got into discussion with a Labour minister who knows his history. At one point, we found ourselves talking about George Dangerfield's 1935 classic (still in print, I believe, and still being discussed in relation to modern politics) The Strange Death of Liberal England, the book that tries to make sense of how the apparent Liberal hegemony in early 20th-century British politics collapsed into complete marginality in the aftermath of the first world war. Were we beginning to witness the Strange Death of Labour England, I wondered. Even then, it felt as though Labour was sliding inexorably downwards from its own hegemonic years under Tony Blair. It was hard to see a sign, or indeed any reason, why the slide should not continue. Not so fast, responded my ministerial companion. Labour is certainly sliding disastrously, he admitted. No argument about the short-term seriousness of the decline. But you forget that Labour's vote is still based on class identity, not ideology. That wasn't, in the end, true of the Liberals once all men and women got the vote after 1918 and 1928. The Liberals were an ideological party. When they went into decline they went into decline everywhere  north, south, east and west  as their ideology fell apart in new conditions. Labour is simply different. Even in decline, Labour is still electorally concentrated in particular regions, where its class identity remains strong. As long as first-past-the-post continues, Labour is likely to remain strong at Westminster, and thus is in a position, if it takes the right decisions, to rebound. The classic proof of that came in the 1983 election, when Labour and the Liberal/SDP Alliance each polled about 8m votes, but Labour ended up with 209 MPs against the alliance's 23. Today, as the 2009 Labour party conference disperses, there is still truth in what the minister said. Those who are angrily anxious to write the obituary of the Labour party on the basis of its current slide in the polls  at 23% this week, Labour is now five points adrift of the 28% it polled in 1983, hitherto seen as the most ignominious result in its modern history  need to recognise that opinion poll decline does not necessarily translate into terminal irrelevance. First past the post has a lot to do with this, but in a different way in 2009-10 compared with 1983. Back in 1983, it was the solidity of the Labour heartlands that allowed the party to remain a big player. This time, the growth of third, fourth and fifth parties may have a similar effect, allowing Labour to win a surprisingly large number of seats on quite small shares of the poll in individual constituencies. In other words, Labour could benefit from a microcosmic effect rather similar to the macro effect from which it benefited in 2005, when 35.2% support gave Labour 356 seats and a healthy Commons majority of 66. A lot of Labour MPs may actually survive next year thanks to the strength of small parties  outright winners with shares in the low 30s and even the upper 20s may not be uncommon. Brighton gave one a kind of hallucinatory vision of how this process might feel. Inside the conference bubble, Labour has had a decent conference. Gordon Brown was quite good. His senior ministers were often more than OK. The party had good things to say. There were no plots and few embarrassments. The conference found, to its surprise, that the party actually felt quite good about itself. The conference has been, in short, restorative for a party that fears and even knows that electoral disaster is now just months away. It's all relative, of course, and blind loyalism is an unattractive quality at the best of times, but my point, which I don't think anyone who has been in Brighton can seriously dispute, is that this has been a good conference for Labour in all the circumstances. Outside the bubble, of course, it feels and is different. People aren't interested. They think Brown is useless. Politics is not an important part of their lives. Leave the conference centre and you don't meet lobbyists or protesters, you meet freshers' week students getting legless on pub-crawl drinking binges. It's another world entirely. But that's my point. When the election comes, most people will vote, not stay away. And in Labour areas, a lot of them will continue to vote Labour for all the old mix of reasons. I'm not at all saying Labour will win or do well in the general election. The result will probably be decisively awful. But I remain to be persuaded that Labour is as dead as some now believe. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, a sign of hope or of despair, is not the point. This isn't the strange death of Labour England (or Scotland or Wales). It's the strange living death of Labour England. And that's a different thing from the oblivion that was wreaked on the Liberals nearly a century ago."
12,"b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday March 28, 2005</b> <br><br>Henry Hyde is mistakenly described below as a US senator when he is a member of the House of Representatives.<br><br><hr size=""1""><br>The Republican senators who have devoted their careers to mauling the United Nations are seldom accused of shyness. But they went strangely quiet on Thursday. Henry Hyde became Henry Jekyll. Norm Coleman's mustard turned to honey. Convinced that the UN is a conspiracy against the sovereignty of the United States, they had been ready to launch the attack which would have toppled the hated Kofi Annan and destroyed his organisation. A report by Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US federal reserve, was meant to have proved that, as a result of corruption within the UN's oil-for-food programme, Saddam Hussein was able to sustain his regime by diverting oil revenues into his own hands. But Volcker came up with something else.""The major source of external financial resources to the Iraqi regime,"" he reported, ""resulted from sanctions violations outside the [oil-for-food] programme's framework."" These violations consisted of ""illicit sales"" of oil by the Iraqi regime to Turkey and Jordan. The members of the UN security council, including the United States, knew about them but did nothing. ""United States law requires that assistance programmes to countries in violation of UN sanctions be ended unless continuation is determined to be in the national interest. Such determinations were provided by successive United States administrations.""The government of the US, in other words, though it had been informed about a smuggling operation which brought Saddam Hussein's regime some $4.6bn, decided to let it continue. It did so because it deemed the smuggling to be in its national interest, as it helped friendly countries (Turkey and Jordan) evade the sanctions on Iraq. The biggest source of illegal funds to Saddam Hussein was approved not by officials of the UN but by officials in the US. Strange to relate, neither Mr Hyde nor Mr Coleman have yet been bellyaching about it. But this isn't the half of it.It is true that the UN's auditing should have been better. Some of the oil-for-food money found its way into Saddam Hussein's hands. One of its officials, with the help of a British diplomat, helped to ensure that a contract went to a British firm, rather than a French one. The most serious case involves an official called Benon Sevan, who is alleged to have channelled Iraqi oil into a company he favoured, and who might have received $160,000 in return. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has taken disciplinary action against both men, and promised to strip them of diplomatic immunity if they are charged. There could scarcely be a starker contrast to the way the US has handled the far graver allegations against its own officials.Four days before Volcker reported his findings about Saddam Hussein, the US inspector general for Iraq reconstruction published a report about the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) - the US agency which governed Iraq between April 2003 and June 2004. The inspector general's job is to make sure that the money the authority spent was properly accounted for. It wasn't. In just 14 months, $8.8bn went absent without leave. This is more than Mobutu Sese Seko managed to steal in 32 years of looting Zaire. It is 55,000 times as much as Mr Sevan is alleged to have been paid.The authority, the inspector general found, was ""burdened by severe inefficiencies and poor management"". This is kind. Other investigations suggest that it was also burdened by false accounting, fraud and corruption.Last week a British adviser to the Iraqi Governing Council told the BBC's File on Four programme that officials in the CPA were demanding bribes of up to $300,000 in return for awarding contracts. Iraqi money seized by US forces simply disappeared. Some $800m was handed out to US commanders without being counted or even weighed. A further $1.4bn was flown from Baghdad to the Kurdish regional government in the town of Irbil, and has not been seen since.Contracts to US companies were awarded by the CPA without any financial safeguards. They were issued without competition, in the form of ""cost-plus"" deals. This means that the companies were paid for the expenses they incurred, plus a percentage of those expenses in the form of profit. They had a powerful incentive, in other words, to spend as much money as possible. As a result, the authority appears to have obtained appalling value for money. Auditors at the Pentagon, for example, allege that, in the course of just one contract, a subsidiary of Halliburton overcharged it for imported fuel by $61m. This appears to have been officially sanctioned. In November, the New York Times obtained a letter from an officer in the US Army Corps of Engineers insisting that she would not ""succumb to the political pressures from the ... US embassy to go against my integrity and pay a higher price for fuel than necessary"". She was overruled by her superiors, who issued a memo insisting that the prices the company was charging were ""fair and reasonable"", and that it wouldn't be asked to provide the figures required to justify them.Other companies appear to have charged the authority for work they never did, or to have paid subcontractors to do it for them for a fraction of what they were paid by the CPA. Yet, even when confronted by cast-iron evidence of malfeasance, the authority kept employing them. When the inspector general recommended that the US army withhold payments from companies which appear to have overcharged it, it ignored him. No one has been charged or punished. The US department of justice refuses to assist the whistle-blowers who are taking these companies to court.What makes all this so serious is that more than half the money the CPA was giving away did not belong to the US government but to the people of Iraq. Most of it was generated by the coalition's sales of oil. If you think the UN's oil-for-food programme was leaky, take a look at the CPA's oil-for-reconstruction scheme. Throughout the entire period of CPA rule, there was no metering of the oil passing through Iraq's pipelines, which means that there was no way of telling how much of the country's wealth the authority was extracting, or whether it was paying a fair price for it. The CPA, according to the international monitoring body charged with auditing it, was also ""unable to estimate the amount of petroleum ... that was smuggled"".The authority was plainly breaching UN resolutions. As Christian Aid points out, the CPA's distribution of Iraq's money was supposed to have been subject to international oversight from the beginning. But no auditors were appointed until April 2004 - just two months before the CPA's mandate ran out. Even then, they had no power to hold it to account or even to ask it to cooperate. But enough information leaked out to suggest that $500m of Iraqi oil money might have been ""diverted"" (a polite word for nicked) to help pay for the military occupation.I hope that Messrs Hyde and Coleman won't stop asking whether Iraqi oil money has been properly spent. But perhaps we shouldn't be surprised if their agreeable silence persists."
12,"The paradox of modern warfare works like this: by enhancing our military strength, we enhance our opponents' capacity to destroy us. The Russian state developed thermobaric bombs (which release a cloud of explosive material into the air) for use against Muslim guerrillas. Now, according to New Scientist, Muslim terrorists are trying to copy them. The United States has been producing weaponised anthrax, ostensibly to anticipate terrorist threats. In 2001, anthrax stolen from this programme was used to terrorise America. The greatest horrors with which terrorists might threaten us are those whose development we funded. Given that the most frightening of these technologies is nuclear weaponry, and given that the possibility that terrorists might acquire them becomes more real as the list of nuclear powers lengthens, we should be grateful to Tony Blair for encouraging disarmament in Libya. Though Libya's programme was less advanced than we were led to believe (its ""4,000 uranium centrifuges"" turned out to be merely centrifuge casings), and though Blair's enthusiasm was doubtless sharpened by the opportunities Libya offers to British corporations, we should not permit our reasonable cynicism to obscure the fact that, for just the second time in history, a state has voluntarily renounced its nuclear technologies. Libya, unlike India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea or Iran, is now abiding by the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  But amid all the backslapping last week, something was forgotten. This is that the treaty which Gadafy has honoured was a two-way deal. Those states which did not possess nuclear weapons would not seek to acquire them. In return, the states which already possessed them - the US, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom - would ""pursue negotiations in good faith... on general and complete disarmament"". Libya is now in conformity with international law. The United Kingdom is not.  At the end of next month, British officials will be travelling to New York for a meeting about the five-yearly review of the treaty. It is hard to see what their negotiating position will be. For they have precious little evidence of ""good faith"" to show.  It is true that, since the end of the cold war, the UK's total nuclear explosive power has been reduced by 70%. But that appears to be as low as the government will ever permit it to go. The defence white paper, published in December, notes: ""Decisions on whether to replace Trident are not needed this parliament, but are likely to be required in the next one. We will therefore... ensure that the range of options for maintaining a nuclear deterrent capability is kept open."" Trident stays until it reaches the end of its natural life, whatever the rest of the world may offer. And then? Nothing this government has said or done suggests that it would consider decommissioning those warheads without replacing them.  To this sin of omission we must add three of commission. The first is the UK's support for the US nuclear missile defence programme, which could scarcely be better calculated to provoke a new arms race. This month the Fylingdales radar station in North Yorkshire is being upgraded to accommodate it.  The second is that the government has laid out £2bn to equip the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston with the means to design and build a new generation of tactical nuclear weapons. In this respect, as in all others, we appear to be keeping the US company. Earlier this month, the US National Nuclear Security Administration released its budget documents for research into the ""robust nuclear earth penetrator"", a first-strike bunker-busting bomb which, if developed, would blow the non-proliferation treaty to kingdom come. The US government had claimed that all it wanted to do was to conduct a feasibility study. But, the new documents show, it has now budgeted to design, test and start producing it by 2009.The third is that our policy on the deployment of nuclear weapons has changed. In March 2002, for the first time in British history, the government suggested that we might use them before they are used against us. Since then, Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, has repeated the threat several times, on each occasion further reducing the threshold. Put items two and three together and the UK begins to look like a pretty dangerous state. So how does the government reconcile all this with its commitment to the treaty? By reinterpreting it. In October last year, Geoff Hoon told the House of Commons: ""Under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, China and Russia are legally entitled to possess nuclear weapons.""  The treaty says nothing of the kind. It's a short and simple document, which anyone but Geoff Hoon can understand, and it says just two things about the nuclear weapons possessed by the five major powers: they mustn't be transferred to non-nuclear states, and they must be dismantled.  Fifteen years ago, amid massive controversy, Labour abandoned its commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament. Now Hoon's rewriting of the non-proliferation treaty suggests that it is quietly abandoning its commitment to multilateral disarmament.  Or we could put it another way: that the Labour party has rediscovered its enthusiasm for unilateralism, as long as it's someone else who is doing the disarming. As Simon Thomas pointed out in a Commons debate last week, the government's ""non-proliferation unit"" has recently changed its name to the ""proliferation prevention unit"", to reflect the new policy of reverse unilateral disarmament.   How all this plays with the new nuclear powers is not hard to imagine. If a nation like Britain - whose prime minister poses as a broker of peace and disarmament - has abandoned the non-proliferation treaty, is installing the capacity to build a new generation of nuclear weapons, has asserted the right to strike pre-emptively and is beginning, in short, to look like a large and well-armed rogue state, then what possible incentive do other nations have to abandon their weapons?  Indeed, the lesson the weaker states will draw from the conduct of the major powers over the past year is that they should acquire as many nuclear weapons as they can. If you don't possess them, you can expect to be invaded. If you do, you can expect to be left in peace, or (if you have oil) courted and bribed. And if you get rid of them, you would be an idiot to expect the big nuclear states to reciprocate.  Power, the new British doctrine appears to assert, grows out of the payload of a bomb. This may once have been true, when our enemies were states which had everything to lose by starting a nuclear war. But when your enemies are suicide bombers, and when they have no direct connection to a nation state, mutually assured destruction ceases to be a useful threat. Your intransigence merely encourages proliferation elsewhere, and so enhances the possibility that nuclear material will fall into the hands of terrorists. The more we assert our strength, the more vulnerable we become.<B>"
12,"A few months ago, I accepted an invitation to speak at the Oxford Union, the university society famed throughout the world for the brilliance of its debates. I don't think they'll be inviting me again. We were supposed to be discussing an issue of critical importance (""this house believes that big business is the natural enemy of the environment""), but it soon became clear that hardly any of the students who had chosen to speak were remotely interested in the subject. One of my supporters appeared to have confined his research to examining the definitions of each of the words in the motion. One of my opponents flatly contradicted himself six times in his efforts to establish his circumlocutory magnificence. The president - a drawling, swaggering 20-year-old in white tie and tails - announced that, as was customary, the Spectator magazine had reserved a magnum of champagne for the best speech from the floor; before awarding it, as also appeared to be customary, to the person who made the evening's most fatuous contribution. Throughout the ""debate"", the speakers used conventions which made the House of Lords look chic: ""No, honourable sir, I will not yield"". The men forced their squeaky voices down the register until they sounded like port-soaked peers of the realm. They were no more than 19- or 20-years-old, but it seemed to me that they had hearts like stones.  I went home feeling physically sick, and turned on the radio while I was brushing my teeth. It was Today in Parliament. I listened with a growing sense of recognition: there was the same cleverness, and the same utter lack of conviction. It struck me more forcibly than ever before that power in Britain remains the preserve of those who care for nothing but themselves. Shaun Woodward, complete with butler, estate and personality bypass, slides effortlessly across the house. Michael Portillo, once the most illiberal man in mainstream politics, can reposition himself as the champion of the oppressed. When politics is a matter of convenience, not conviction, only the self-interested prosper.  So how, in the age of information, do these people continue to steal power from the rest of us? An article this weekend by Tess Kingham, who was elected Labour MP for Gloucester in 1997, but who stood down at this election, shows just how far unprincipled and power-hungry people will go to defend their political monopoly. When she refused to vote for cuts in disability benefits, Labour whips threatened that the government could withdraw resources from her constituency. If she continued to cause trouble, she was warned, her ""political career was finished"".  She complained to one of the papers. In response, the whips threatened to expose her private life in the tabloids. Another woman MP who refused to vote as the government instructed was physically assaulted in a House of Commons corridor. Tess Kingham was given a bal lot form for the national executive committee elections, only to find that it had already been filled in for her by party managers. She was told how to vote even on early day motions, which are supposed to be independent of party control.  It's impossible for idealistic, free-thinking people like Tess Kingham to survive in a system like this. But for some of those I met in the Oxford Union, who appear to possess neither standards nor principles, it offers a straight path to power. Only those who are prepared to make a mockery of representative democracy can prosper under the parliamentary whip.  Before the 1997 election, Tony Blair promised to change all this. He would, he maintained, ""create a new relationship between the government and the people, based on trust, freedom, choice and responsibility."" He launched a programme of constitutional reform to tackle some of the 17th-century absurdities which still govern our political system. And he did, in truth, introduce some significant reforms: establishing Welsh and Scottish assemblies, allowing the passage of the Human Rights Act and reducing the number of hereditary peers allowed to vote in the House of Lords. But, as the pressure group Charter 88 has shown, Labour has swept away parts of the old constitution, but failed to replace it with a new one. By dismantling some of the old-fashioned checks and balances, it has merely consolidated the inordinate power of the prime minister and his advisers.  Mrs Thatcher's constitutional legacy lives on in the New Labour government. Tony Blair has continued to challenge the independence of the civil service, to remove power from local government, to bypass the cabinet, to bully his MPs. His office appears to have controlled even the appointment of the new ""people's peers"". In March, when one of the government's bills looked as if it would run out of parliamentary time, Labour MPs were forced to agree that the bill ""shall be deemed to have been reported to the House ... as if"" its clauses and schedules ""had been ordered to stand"". In other words, as Private Eye has pointed out, for the first time in history the Commons voted to pretend that a bill had been passed by parliament when it hadn't. MPs are now all but redundant.  Though New Labour has dismissed real constitutional reform as ""a chattering classes issue"", it must surely now be obvious that the abysmal turnout among voters of all classes was the result of its failure to change the way that politics works in Britain. When Labour MPs are forced to vote as if they are Tories, there's not much point in choosing between them. And while our antiquated first-past-the-post electoral system survives, there's not much point, in most constituencies, in choosing anyone else. When the political class keeps   power to itself, it can't expect the rest of us to participate.  It seems to me that one of the key tasks of the next four years is to mobilise the millions of disenchanted voters who stayed away from the ballot, to demand both a wider choice of electable candidates and their freedom to vote as their constituents would wish. Proportional representation and the full state funding of political parties must clearly be part of the package, but we also need to find the means to prevent people who are interested only in themselves from representing anyone else.  My proposal is to peg MPs' salaries to the national average wage and forbid them any further earnings. This would ensure that they were forced to live like the rest of us, rather than, as the sonorous pipsqueaks of the Oxford Union are practising to live, like our lords and masters. People interested only in self-advancement would keep away from parliament.  It seems to me that there is also a   clear case for abandoning the entire parliamentary whipping system. It should be illegal to interfere in an MP's decisions. If parties wish to persuade their members to vote in a particular way, they should do so by means of argument, not threats. Any suggestion that someone's voting record will affect the course of her career would be referred to a parliamentary ombudsman. With a written constitution, full public disclosure of all government business and an enforceable list of MPs' duties towards their constituents, the people of Britain might begin to see the point of parliament once more.  But if Blair is not prepared to complete the constitutional reform he has begun, we'll be left with the least accountable political system Britain has seen since women secured the vote. And when politics belongs to someone else, it's not hard to see why the electorate should be so reluctant to endorse it."
12,"It's about as close to consensus as the left is ever likely to come. Everyone this side of Atilla the Hun and the Wall Street Journal agrees that Paul Wolfowitz's appointment as president of the World Bank is a catastrophe. Except me. Under Wolfowitz, my fellow progressives lament, the World Bank will work for America. If only someone else were chosen, it would work for the world's poor. Joseph Stiglitz, the bank's renegade former chief economist, champions Ernesto Zedillo, a former president of Mexico. A Guardian leading article suggested Colin Powell or, had he been allowed to stand, Bono. But what all this hand-wringing reveals is a profound misconception about the role and purpose of the body Wolfowitz will run. The World Bank and the IMF were conceived by the US economist Harry Dexter White. Appointed by the US Treasury to lead the negotiations on postwar economic reconstruction, White spent most of 1943 banging the heads of the other allied nations together. They were appalled by his proposals. He insisted that his institutions would place the burden of stabilising the world economy on the countries suffering from debt and trade deficits rather than on the creditors. He insisted that ""the more money you put in, the more votes you have"". He decided, before the meeting at Bretton Woods in 1944, that ""the US should have enough votes to block any decision"".  Both the undemocratic voting arrangement and the US veto remain to this day. The result is that a body that works mostly in poor countries is controlled by rich ones. White demanded that national debts be redeemable for gold, that gold be convertible into dollars, and that exchange rates be fixed against the dollar. The result was to lay the ground for what was to become the dollar's global hegemony. White also decided that the IMF and the bank would be sited in Washington.  At the time, no one doubted that these bodies were designed as instruments of US economic policy, but all this has been airbrushed from history. Even the admirable Stiglitz believes the bank was the brainchild of the British economist John Maynard Keynes (he was, in fact, its most prominent opponent). When Noreena Hertz wrote on these pages last month that ""the Bush administration is a very long way from the bank's espoused goals and mandate"", she couldn't have been more wrong.  From the perspective of the world's poor, there has never been a good president of the World Bank. In seeking contrasts with Wolfowitz, it has become fashionable to look back to the reign of that other Pentagon hawk, Robert McNamara. He is supposed to have become, in the words of an Observer leader, ""one of the most admired and effective of World Bank presidents"". Admired in Washington, perhaps. McNamara was the man who concentrated almost all the bank's lending on vast prestige schemes (highways, ports, dams) while freezing out less glamorous causes such as health, education and sanitation. Most of the major projects he backed have, in economic or social terms or both, failed catastrophically. It was he who argued that the bank should not fund land reform because it ""would affect the power base of the traditional elite groups"". Instead, as Catherine Caufield shows in her book Masters of Illusion, it should ""open new land by cutting down forests, draining wetlands and building roads to previously isolated areas"". He bankrolled Mobutu and Suharto, deforested Nepal, trashed the Amazon and promoted genocide in Indonesia. The countries he worked in were left with unpayable debts, wrecked environments, grinding poverty and pro-US dictators.  Except for the language in which US demands are articulated, little has changed. In the meeting last Thursday at which Wolfowitz's nomination was confirmed, the bank's executive directors decided to approve the construction of the Nam Theun 2 dam in Laos. This will flood 6,000 people out of their homes, damage the livelihoods of a further 120,000, destroy a critical ecosystem and produce electricity not for the people of Laos but for their richer neighbours in Thailand. It will also generate enormous construction contracts for western companies. The decision was made not on Wolfowitz's watch but on that of the current president, James Wolfensohn. There will be little practical difference between the two wolves. The problem is not the bank's management but its board, which is dominated by the US, the UK and the other rich nations.   The nationality of the bank's president, which has been causing so much fuss, is of only symbolic importance. Yes, it seems grossly unfair that all its presidents are Americans, while all IMF presidents are Europeans. But it doesn't matter where the technocrat implementing the US Treasury's decisions comes from. What matters is that he's a technocrat implementing the US Treasury's decisions. Wolfowitz's appointment is a good thing for three reasons. It highlights the profoundly unfair and undemocratic nature of decision-making at the bank. His presidency will stand as a constant reminder that this institution, which calls on the nations it bullies to exercise ""good governance and democratisation"" is run like a medieval monarchy. It also demolishes the hopeless re  formism of men such as Stiglitz and George Soros who, blithely ignoring the fact that the US can veto any attempt to challenge its veto, keep waving their wands in the expectation that a body designed to project US power can be magically transformed into a body that works for the poor. Had Stiglitz's attempt to tinker with the presidency succeeded, it would simply have lent credibility to an illegitimate institution, enhancing its powers. With Wolfowitz in charge, its credibility plummets.  Best of all is the chance that the neocons might just be stupid enough to use the new wolf to blow the bank down. Clare Short laments that ""it's as though they are trying to wreck our international systems"". What a tragedy that would be. I'd sob all the way to the party.  Martin Jacques argued convincingly on these pages last week that the US neocons are ""reordering the world system to take account of their newly defined power and interests"". Wolfowitz's appointment is, he suggested, one of the ""means of breaking the old order"". But this surely illustrates the unacknowledged paradox in neocon thinking. They want to drag down the old, multilateral order and replace it with a new, US one. What they fail to understand is that the ""multilateral"" system is in fact a projection of US unilateralism, cleverly packaged to grant other nations just enough slack to prevent them from fighting it. Like their opponents, the neocons fail to understand how well Roosevelt and Truman stitched up the international order. They are seeking to replace a hegemonic system that is enduring and effective with one that is untested and (because other nations must fight it) unstable. Anyone who believes in global justice should wish them luck.  www.monbiot.com"
12,"There is no notion so flawed that society will not, at some time, adopt it as a universal truth. Few misconceptions are as widespread as the idea that the war against cancer is being won. It's hardly surprising, for scarcely a week goes by without a promise that deliverance is just around the corner. Yesterday, for example, we learnt that a new injection might cure lymphomas. The day before, the government announced that a further £90m would help to eliminate intestinal tumours. Cancer, most commentators agree, is all but dead.  So it's perplexing to discover that cancer in industrialised countries is not falling, but rising. While lung, cervical, uterine and stomach cancers are declining, and treatments for testicular cancer and childhood leukaemia have greatly improved, cancer overall has increased by 60% in the past 50 years. Breast cancer has almost doubled. Prostate cancer has risen by 200%, testicular cancer in young men by 300%. In the US, childhood brain cancers and leukaemias have been advancing by 1.8% a year since 1973. In Britain, 40% of us are likely to contract cancer at some stage in our lives.   These increases are often ascribed to better detection and an ageing population. But the figures are age-adjusted: a 60-year-old today is 200% more likely to contract prostate cancer than a 60-year-old would have been in 1950. Reported cancers have continued to rise after the universal deployment of new screening techniques: this is not an artefact of diagnosis. Cancer is thriving.   According to Samuel Epstein, professor of environmental medicine at the University of Illinois, the reason is obvious. Since 1940, the world's production of synthetic organic chemicals has risen 600-fold, exposing our bodies to a massive toxic load. There is plenty of evidence to support his contention.   Last year, for example, a US study found that children living beside busy roads were six times as likely to suffer from cancer as children living in quiet areas. This is hardly surprising: the two most carcinogenic compounds ever detected are both produced by diesel engines. An English study published in 1997 showed that children living within five kilometres of oil refineries and chemical plants were more likely to contract cancer than those living further away.   Figures released by the US Environmental Protection Agency last year suggest that as many as 7% of all cancers are caused by dioxins, mostly from incinerators. A Danish study published in 1999 showed that women whose   bodies contain high concentrations of the pesticide dieldrin are twice as likely to develop cancer. Other scientific papers have highlighted the dangers of herbicides, beef hormones, petrol additives, oral contraceptives, artificial sweeteners, PVC and scores of other chemicals.   So I commend to you a fascinating document, published by the Department of Health, called the NHS Cancer Plan, which tells us how the government intends to eliminate cancer in England. It contains plenty of helpful advice on giving up smoking. It outlines a scheme for increasing the amount of fruit and vegetables children eat. But only one pollutant is mentioned as a possible cause of cancer: radon gas, which happens to be naturally occurring.   It's not hard to see that both the major polluting industries and the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing cancer ""cures"" (they are often one and the same) have a certain interest in sustaining the status quo. But it strikes me that these might   not be the only lobbyists the government is listening to. The big cancer charities also appear reluctant to take contamination seriously.   The Imperial Cancer Research Fund's website records no matches for the word ""pollution"". The researcher Martin Walker reports that of the 110 research units cited in its 1998 scientific report, not one deals with chemical or environmental carcinogens. Last year the Cancer Research Campaign predicted that cancer would be cured by 2050, as a result of new genetic technologies. Its website mentions pollution, but dismisses concerns with the claim that ""experts think that only 5% of preventable cancer deaths may be linked to environmental factors"".   The CRC's 10-page press release on poverty and cancer blames inequalities in treatment for differing rates of death, but says nothing about pollution, even though the poor are far more likely to live beside dirty factories and toxic dumps than the rich.   Give them more money, the cancer charities claim, and they will find the magic formula which will save us all from a hideous death. But could it be possible that we are dying so that they might live?"
12,"William Hague, according to the new register of members' interests, makes about 20 times as much for not being an MP as he makes for being one. We don't know exactly how much he is paid for his other 54 jobs, because members are not obliged to reveal the price of work which doesn't relate directly to their parliamentary duties. But he must have raked in about a million last year. Even so, he's probably not the richest person in the house. According to the parliamentary code of conduct, you must declare any shareholding worth more than the current MP's salary. Dame Marion Roe, the Tory MP for Broxbourne, has 18 declarations, which suggests she owns liquid capital worth at least £1m. Archie Norman, the Conservative party's former chief executive, has 17 registrable shareholdings and five external employers. Michael Ancram, the party's deputy leader, lists, with aristocratic modesty, ""farms ... houses and miscellaneous property on Scottish borders"". Note the unquantified plural.  But there is little sense anywhere - in parliament, in the press or among the public - that MPs' second and third and, in Hague's case, 55th sources of income equate to any kind of problem. Thanks to the rules laid down by the committee on standards in public life, you would now have to be both staggeringly stupid and staggeringly greedy to take cash for parliamentary questions.   The potential contest between our MPs' duty to represent the public and their interest in representing their other employers is generally deemed to have been resolved. They are forbidden to act as paid advocates ""in any proceeding of the house"". They can't speak or act on any issue in which they have an undeclared interest. Their sources of income are listed on the internet. The system is transparent and seemly. But it appears to me that all the commission has achieved is to legitimise a series of disastrous conflicts of interest.  The most obvious of these is a conflict which MPs appear capable of understanding only when it involves other people, such as the consultant physicians who are supposed to be working for the NHS. If MPs are permitted to moonlight, and if their salaries are paid whether they do their jobs well or not, they have a permanent incentive to spend as little time on them as possible, and as much time as they can making money elsewhere.  There are some MPs who have extraordinary reserves of energy. Chris Smith, the former culture secretary, who now supplements his salary by providing services to another 17 employers, tells me he works between 70 and 80 hours a week, and devotes at least half to his parliamentary duties. Howard Flight, a Tory MP with 11 directorships, works an astonishing 100 hours a week, of which, he says, 80 are spent representing the people. But these MPs are surely exceptional. Research by the Labour member Peter Bradley reveals that MPs with outside interests participate, on average, in 65% of Commons votes, while MPs with no other paid employment attend 91%. One representative I spoke to argued, in effect, that this is because they have nothing better to do. The problem is that this is true in both senses.  Perhaps more importantly, the more money MPs earn, and the more they associate with other directors and lawyers and consultants, the less like their constituents they become. There are surely two components of representation: representing the people and being representative of the people. MPs' pay (at £57,500, more than twice the national average) already removes them from the economic lives of most of their constituents. Outside earnings push them into the richest 1%. The servants of the people can employ the people as their servants.   All the MPs who defend second jobs argue that the other work they do informs and improves their parliamentary performance, as it keeps them in touch with the outside world. I would be more inclined to believe this if they were moonlighting as hospital porters or assembly-line workers. But no MP takes a second paid job unless it is either prestigious or lucrative. They have no simultaneous experience of soul-destroying drudgery. Howard Flight argues, reasonably enough, that those MPs who are sponsored by trade unions remain informed by the worker's point of view. The problem is that 76 MPs are paid by corporations, and only six are sponsored by the unions. (More MPs have declared gifts of pheasant and grouse shooting than union support.) The trade unions have less money than the corporations, so they can purchase fewer loyalties.  The MPs counter this by pointing out that their constituency work brings the whole world through their doors. Ian Taylor, a Conservative MP with seven directorships, told me: ""I don't have to be a hospital porter to understand the problems hospital porters are facing."" This is true. Being true, it disposes of the argument that external employment is necessary to understand the outside world.  Perhaps the biggest problem arises not from the interventions MPs might be prompted by their interests to make, but from those they are prompted not to make. Eighty-seven MPs, including the leaders of the three main parties and eight cabinet members, earn at least £5,750 a year by renting out property. As a result we are unlikely to see action taken against one of the UK's biggest social problems: house price inflation caused by people buying to let. Even if MPs were inclined to attack their own interests, they would expose themselves to the charge of hypocrisy. So they keep quiet and incur no penalty. No one has to declare an interest in what he is not saying, and no code of conduct could make him do so. The clash is perpetually and inaudibly resolved in favour of money.  Ask yourself what can be done about it, and you are immediately apprised of a fourth, overarching conflict. We could propose, for example, that MPs should be forbidden to work for anyone other than their constituents. Or we could suggest that they are allowed to continue working or owning houses and shares, but that the money goes either to charity or to the exchequer. The problem is that the last people who are ever going to vote for such measures are the people they would penalise. Peter Bradley was forced to withdraw his attempt to prevent MPs from being paid for neglecting their duties when the Tories promised to talk it out of time.  What all this shows is that transparency is not enough. We can read the register of members' interests and immediately discover who is moonlighting and for whom. We can search Hansard and discover whether they are using their parliamentary roles to pursue their own economic interests. But this information simply confronts us with our own powerlessness. Transparent corruption is doubtless an improvement upon opaque corruption, but it seems only to have dissuaded people from pressing the case for no corruption at all. If there is one job which should command a person's undivided loyalties, it is surely the job of representing us. "
12,"To understand what is happening in the Middle East, you must first understand what is happening in Texas. To understand what is happening there, you should read the resolutions passed at the state's Republican party conventions last month. Take a look, for example, at the decisions made in Harris County, which covers much of Houston. The delegates began by nodding through a few uncontroversial matters: homosexuality is contrary to the truths ordained by God; ""any mechanism to process, license, record, register or monitor the ownership of guns"" should be repealed; income tax, inheritance tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax should be abolished; and immigrants should be deterred by electric fences. Thus fortified, they turned to the real issue: the affairs of a small state 7,000 miles away. It was then, according to a participant, that the ""screaming and near fist fights"" began.  I don't know what the original motion said, but apparently it was ""watered down significantly"" as a result of the shouting match. The motion they adopted stated that Israel has an undivided claim to Jerusalem and the West Bank, that Arab states should be ""pressured"" to absorb refugees from Palestine, and that Israel should do whatever it wishes in seeking to eliminate terrorism. Good to see that the extremists didn't prevail then.  But why should all this be of such pressing interest to the people of a state which is seldom celebrated for its fascination with foreign affairs? The explanation is slowly becoming familiar to us, but we still have some difficulty in taking it seriously.  In the United States, several million people have succumbed to an extraordinary delusion. In the 19th century, two immigrant preachers cobbled together a series of unrelated passages from the Bible to create what appears to be a consistent narrative: Jesus will return to Earth when certain preconditions have been met. The first of these was the establishment of a state of Israel. The next involves Israel's occupation of the rest of its ""biblical lands"" (most of the Middle East), and the rebuilding of the Third Temple on the site now occupied by the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosques. The legions of the antichrist will then be deployed against Israel, and their war will lead to a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon. The Jews will either burn or convert to Christianity, and the Messiah will return to Earth.  What makes the story so appealing to Christian fundamentalists is that before the big battle begins, all ""true believers"" (ie those who believe what they believe) will be lifted out of their clothes and wafted up to heaven during an event called the Rapture. Not only do the worthy get to sit at the right hand of God, but they will be able to watch, from the best seats, their political and religious opponents being devoured by boils, sores, locusts and frogs, during the seven years of Tribulation which follow.  The true believers are now seeking to bring all this about. This means staging confrontations at the old temple site (in 2000, three US Christians were deported for trying to blow up the mosques there), sponsoring Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, demanding ever more US support for Israel, and seeking to provoke a final battle with the Muslim world/Axis of Evil/United Nations/ European Union/France or whoever the legions of the antichrist turn out to be.  The believers are convinced that they will soon be rewarded for their efforts. The antichrist is apparently walking among us, in the guise of Kofi Annan, Javier Solana, Yasser Arafat or, more plausibly, Silvio Berlusconi. The Wal-Mart corporation is also a candidate (in my view a very good one), because it wants to radio-tag its stock, thereby exposing humankind to the Mark of the Beast.  By clicking on www.raptureready.com, you can discover how close you might be to flying out of your pyjamas. The infidels among us should take note that the Rapture Index currently stands at 144, just one point below the critical threshold, beyond which the sky will be filled with floating nudists. Beast Government, Wild Weather and Israel are all trading at the maximum five points (the EU is debat ing its constitution, there was a freak hurricane in the south Atlantic, Hamas has sworn to avenge the killing of its leaders), but the second coming is currently being delayed by an unfortunate decline in drug abuse among teenagers and a weak showing by the antichrist (both of which score only two).  We can laugh at these people, but we should not dismiss them. That their beliefs are bonkers does not mean they are marginal. American pollsters believe that 15-18% of US voters belong to churches or movements which subscribe to these teachings. A survey in 1999 suggested that this figure included 33% of Republicans. The best-selling contemporary books in the US are the 12 volumes of the Left Behind series, which provide what is usually described as a ""fictionalised"" account of the Rapture (this, apparently, distinguishes it from the other one), with plenty of dripping details about what will happen to the rest of us. The people who believe all this don't believe it just a little; for them it is a matter of life eternal and death.  And among them are some of the most powerful men in America. John Ashcroft, the attorney general, is a true believer, so are several prominent senators and the House majority leader, Tom DeLay. Mr DeLay (who is also the co-author of the marvellously named DeLay-Doolittle Amendment, postponing campaign finance reforms) travelled to Israel last year to tell the Knesset that ""there is no middle ground, no moderate position worth taking"".  So here we have a major political constituency - representing much of the current president's core vote - in the most powerful nation on Earth, which is actively seeking to provoke a new world war. Its members see the invasion of Iraq as a warm-up act, as Revelation (9:14-15) maintains that four angels ""which are bound in the great river Euphrates"" will be released ""to slay the third part of men"". They batter down the doors of the White House as soon as its support for Israel wavers: when Bush asked Ariel Sharon to pull his tanks out of Jenin in 2002, he received 100,000 angry emails from Christian fundamentalists, and never mentioned the matter again.  The electoral calculation, crazy as it appears, works like this. Governments stand or fall on domestic issues. For 85% of the US electorate, the Middle East is a foreign issue, and therefore of secondary interest when they enter the polling booth. For 15% of the electorate, the Middle East is not just a domestic matter, it's a personal one: if the president fails to start a conflagration there, his core voters don't get to sit at the right hand of God. Bush, in other words, stands to lose fewer votes by encouraging Israeli aggression than he stands to lose by restraining it. He would be mad to listen to these people. He would also be mad not to."
12,"State and corporate power are fusing almost everywhere on earth, but in Italy they have condensed into the stocky figure of a single man. Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, is worth around £10bn. He has interests in just about every lucrative sector of the Italian economy. His control of most of the private media (through his businesses) and most of the public media (through the government) means that he can exercise a dominion unprecedented in a democratic nation over the thoughts and feelings of his people. He has been convicted in the past for bribery, tax fraud and corruption but by amending the law has had those convictions overturned and his business activities legalised. His government is sustained by parties which describe themselves as ""post-fascist""; he himself has spoken of the ""superiority"" of western civilisation.  This is the man who is now Tony Blair's closest political ally in Europe. After their meeting on Friday, Sr Berlusconi told the press that ""we see eye to eye on all the matters that were raised"". Blair added: ""Some of these old distinctions - left and right - are no longer in my view as relevant as they were maybe 30, 40 years ago."" Blair and Berlusconi are now the only European leaders who seem prepared to support a US attack on Iraq. Both men have introduced repressive legislation restricting civil liberties. Both have granted big business the concessions it demands. At the European summit in Barcelona next month, they will be forming an alliance with Jos Maria Aznar, the rightwing Spanish prime minister, in the hope of forcing France and Germany to accept new measures demanded by the corporations.   Among their proposals on Friday was the deregulation of employment. ""Europe's labour markets,"" Blair wrote in Italy's Corriere della Sera, ""need to be more flexible. Businesses are still encumbered by unnecessary regulation."" The paper they published called on member states to introduce ""more flexible types of employment contracts""; to replace labour laws with ""soft regulation""; and to increase ""the effectiveness of public employment services... by opening this market to the private sector"".   This is just the latest means by which Blair has chosen to antagonise workers in the United Kingdom. Last week the steelworkers struggling to keep their jobs here discovered that the government has been helping a foreign company to secure and then to finance the acquisition of the vast steelworks in Romania. The Department of Trade and Industry appears to be about to renew the UK's exemption from the European working time directive, which means that this country will remain the only one in Europe that permits some employers to force people to work more than 48 hours a week.    Last year, the official figures for the number of deaths at work rose by 32%. For the past four years, the government has promised the immediate introduction of new safety laws and a new offence of corporate killing. Neither has materialised.   With Berlusconi's help, Tony Blair is seeking to prevent the European Union from banning the anti-competitive deals which permit the private takeover of public services. The result is that public sector workers will continue to lose pay, pensions and holidays as private operators change their terms of employment. The government is now proposing to deny agency workers the legal protections afforded to employees. Those who contest these policies, the prime minister suggested a fortnight ago, are ""wreckers"" and ""small c conservatives"".   So the abiding mystery surrounding labour relations in the United Kingdom is this: given that the government, both in declaration and in practice, is the enemy of workers' movements, why do they continue to fund it?   About one-third of the Labour party's funding comes from the unions. Many of their members are beginning to wonder what they are buying. Last summer the GMB halved its annual donation to the party, in protest against privatisation. Both Unison, the biggest donor, and the firefighters' union are currently reviewing their support. The election of Bob Crow as leader of the RMT last week may suggest that the unions are beginning to desert the party they built.   But this will happen slowly, if it happens at all. Most union leaders, while fiercely critical of Blair's policies, insist that they retain more influence over the government by lobbying from within. It is hard to see what the evidence might be.   In his foreword to the 1998 Fairness at Work white paper, Tony Blair insisted that the policies it contained would ""draw a line under the issue of industrial relations law... Even after the changes we propose, Britain will have the most lightly regulated labour market of any leading economy in the world"".   Blair has proved true to his word. The government will implement those European directives which it has failed to undermine. It may introduce a few concessions for workers in privately financed hospitals. But otherwise Labour, as Blair has warned, has nothing to offer.   The Confederation of British Industry, which does not give the party a penny, swings far more weight with Tony Blair than all the hard-earned millions scraped together by the people whom Labour is supposed to represent. It would make as much sense now for the workers to give their money to the Tories.   It is time, in other words, for the trades unions to embrace their role as wreckers. The party they created has disowned them, so they must disinherit it. They must destroy the system which guarantees that power remains the preserve of the parties of big business.   It doesn't really matter which of Britain's small progressive parties - the Greens, the Socialist Alliance, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, even the Liberal Democrats - they choose to support instead. What counts is that there is an effective radical opposition, which has the resources to start snatching millions of votes from Labour. Political parties, like companies, always move towards those from whom they wish to take trade. One of the reasons why Labour has crept so far to the right is that this is the territory on which it must fight its only serious competitor.   Damage limitation, which is the most the unions who work within government can hope to achieve, does not precipitate change. Workers' representatives will swing no serious political weight until they can force the government to respond to their agenda, as opposed to being forced to respond to the government's. Even the GMB, which is using the funds it has withdrawn from Labour to advertise its dissatisfaction, is wasting its money: Blair knows that he has nothing to fear from it as long as there is no radical alternative to this government.   It is not hard to see why the unions are reluctant to let go. Labour was their creation, and its construction was an extraordinary achievement. But the creature has lumbered away from them, and it works now for those they sought to oppose. Only by building a new one can they hope to lure it back."
12,"The left, almost everyone agrees, is on the run. George Bush's seizure of power has dragged governments everywhere still further to the right. Most of the world's media are deeply hostile to progressive ideas. Now the war in Afghanistan has greatly empowered the illiberal men who launched it. 2002, most commentators believe, will be the year of the right. All this may be true, yet it fails to describe the full scope of problems the left now confronts. The real crisis for progressives, indeed for social democracy in general, arises from a much deeper trend: the gradual atomisation of society.  Collectivism has been both the principal source of social oppression and the principal means of liberation. It has destroyed the lives of women, minorities, heretics and foreigners. It has provided monarchs, capitalists and communists with populations which are easily led and readily deceived. It has also offered health and education, social security, the rule of law, universal human rights, environmental protection and representative government. Today, totalitarianism may be unachievable, but so, perhaps, is the effective redistribution of wealth.  There is a widespread fallacy that the destruction of society was engineered in recent times, notably by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The notion is comforting because it suggests that the trend is reversible. But social fragmentation has been the work of centuries.  In Britain, the rise of the merchant class undermined the cohesive power of the church, the monarchy and the aristocracy. Enclosure dispersed the peasantry. The urban proletariat was, paradoxically, fragmented by successful mass action, which helped bring about universal education and a better distribution of wealth and power, in turn enabling people to pursue their own destinies.   Now, the state has little to gain from social cohesion. We no longer require collectivity even in warfare: battles are fought by a handful of specialists, while the rest of us gawp at them on TV. The only national tasks which demand our engagement are taxation, voting and spending. Otherwise, as far as our leaders are concerned, the less we act in concert, the better.  While we can celebrate the end of socialisation imposed from above, we have also lost the class loyalty, the worker solidarity and the coherent demands for universal rights and services developed from below. Political parties and   trades unions are withering. Charities are likely to follow. The absence of effective mass action has enabled tiny numbers of people to capture much of the world's wealth, and tiny populations of target voters to capture the attentions of government.  There is, in other words, not much left with which traditional social democrats can work. Mobilisation has acquired a new meaning: it's not just that people aren't moving together; they're not moving at all, from in front of the TV or the computer screen. Anti-corporate campaigns have brought together vast numbers of people every few months, but they have so far largely failed to generate a sustained mobilisation of the kind once deployed by trade unions, suffragettes, Chartists, Diggers and Levellers. This leaves them vulnerable to capture by outsiders, such as the alienated young men of the black block, which rampaged in Genoa.  It is striking that those campaigns which have proved capable of sustained action - such as the peasant movements in Mexico, Brazil and south-west India, or the   strikes by the Liverpool dockers and the Dudley hospital workers - have drawn on people who are still bound together by geography, class and profession. These may represent the end of the old collectivity, rather than the beginning of a new one.  What this implies is that those of us who remain committed to the principles of distribution and social justice must strive to develop new forms of collectivism, which do not rely on existing loyalties or patterns of behaviour. This is a formidable task. But, just as mass action accelerated individualism, individualism may help us develop a new kind of mass action.  The smashing of society provides us with the means of building movements which are not limited by national or ethnic loyalties, by adhesion to the workplace or the village. It may permit us to create an internationalist movement far bigger than any before, united by a common opposition to what is now an international ruling class. But first we progressives may have to abandon almost every strategy which has worked in the past.<B>"
12,"Saturday is the 60th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. The nuclear powers are commemorating it in their own special way: by seeking to ensure that the experiment is repeated.As Robin Cook showed in his column last week, the British government appears to have decided to replace our Trident nuclear weapons, without consulting parliament or informing the public. It could be worse than he thinks. He pointed out that the atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston has been re-equipped to build a new generation of bombs. But when this news was first leaked in 2002 a spokesman for the plant insisted the equipment was being installed not to replace Trident but to build either mini-nukes or warheads that could be used on cruise missiles.If this is true it means the government is replacing Trident and developing a new category of boil-in-the-bag weapons. As if to ensure we got the point, Geoff Hoon, then the defence secretary, announced before the leak that Britain would be prepared to use small nukes in a pre-emptive strike against a non-nuclear state. This put us in the hallowed company of North Korea.The Times, helpful as ever, explains why Trident should be replaced. ""A decision to leave the club of nuclear powers,"" it says, ""would diminish Britain's international standing and influence."" This is true, and it accounts for why almost everyone wants the bomb. Two weeks ago, on concluding their new nuclear treaty, George Bush and the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh announced that ""international institutions must fully reflect changes in the global scenario that have taken place since 1945. The president reiterated his view that international institutions are going to have to adapt to reflect India's central and growing role."" This translates as follows: ""Now that India has the bomb it should join the UN security council.""It is because nuclear weapons confer power and status on the states that possess them that the non-proliferation treaty, of which the UK was a founding signatory, determines two things: that the non-nuclear powers should not acquire nuclear weapons, and that the nuclear powers should ""pursue negotiations in good faith on ... general and complete disarmament"". Blair has unilaterally decided to rip it up.But in helping to wreck the treaty we are only keeping up with our friends across the water. In May the US government launched a systematic assault on the agreement. The summit in New York was supposed to strengthen it, but the US, led by John Bolton - the undersecretary for arms control (someone had a good laugh over that one) - refused even to allow the other nations to draw up an agenda for discussion. The talks collapsed, and the treaty may now be all but dead. Needless to say, Bolton has been promoted: to the post of US ambassador to the UN. Yesterday Bush pushed his nomination through by means of a ""recess appointment"": an undemocratic power that allows him to override Congress when its members are on holiday.Bush wanted to destroy the treaty because it couldn't be reconciled with his new plans. Last month the Senate approved an initial $4m for research into a ""robust nuclear earth penetrator"" (RNEP). This is a bomb with a yield about 10 times that of the Hiroshima device, designed to blow up underground bunkers that might contain weapons of mass destruction. (You've spotted the contradiction.) Congress rejected funding for it in November, but Bush twisted enough arms this year to get it restarted. You see what a wonderful world he inhabits when you discover that the RNEP idea was conceived in 1991 as a means of dealing with Saddam Hussein's biological and chemical weapons. Saddam is pacing his cell, but the Bushites, like the Japanese soldiers lost in Malaysia, march on. To pursue his war against the phantom of the phantom of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, Bush has destroyed the treaty that prevents the use of real ones.It gets worse. Last year Congress allocated funding for something called the ""reliable replacement warhead"". The government's story is that the existing warheads might be deteriorating. When they show signs of ageing they can be dismantled and rebuilt to a ""safer and more reliable"" design. It's a pretty feeble excuse for building a new generation of nukes, but it worked. The development of the new bombs probably means the US will also breach the comprehensive test ban treaty - so we can kiss goodbye to another means of preventing proliferation.But the biggest disaster was Bush's meeting with Manmohan Singh a fortnight ago. India is one of three states that possess nuclear weapons and refuse to sign the non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The treaty says India should be denied access to civil nuclear materials. But on July 18 Bush announced that ""as a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology, India should acquire the same benefits and advantages as other such states"". He would ""work to achieve full civil nuclear energy cooperation with India"" and ""seek agreement from Congress to adjust US laws and policies"". Four months before the meeting the US lifted its south Asian arms embargo, selling Pakistan a fleet of F-16 aircraft, capable of a carrying a wide range of missiles, and India an anti-missile system. As a business plan, it's hard to fault.Here then is how it works. If you acquire the bomb and threaten to use it you will qualify for American exceptionalism by proxy. Could there be a greater incentive for proliferation?The implications have not been lost on other states. ""India is looking after its own national interests,"" a spokesman for the Iranian government complained on Wednesday. ""We cannot criticise them for this. But what the Americans are doing is a double standard. On the one hand they are depriving an NPT member from having peaceful technology, but at the same time they are cooperating with India, which is not a member of the NPT."" North Korea (and this is the only good news around at the moment) is currently in its second week of talks with the US. While the Bush administration is doing the right thing by engaging with Pyongyang, the lesson is pretty clear. You could sketch it out as a Venn diagram. If you have oil and aren't developing a bomb (Iraq) you get invaded. If you have oil and are developing a bomb (Iran) you get threatened with invasion, but it probably won't happen. If you don't have oil, but have the bomb, the US representative will fly to your country and open negotiations.The world of George Bush's imagination comes into being by government decree. As a result of his tail-chasing paranoia, assisted by Tony Blair's cowardice and Manmohan Singh's opportunism, the global restraint on the development of nuclear weapons has, in effect, been destroyed in a few months. The world could now be more vulnerable to the consequences of proliferation than it has been for 35 years. Thanks to Bush and Blair, we might not go out with a whimper after all."
12,"British people are no longer taxed on their income, but on their immobility. Only those who cannot move are obliged to pay. This, though almost everyone seems to have missed it, was the real message of this week's Budget. Income tax remains unchanged, but the tariffs on business are collapsing. Capital gains tax has been slashed. The ""withholding tax"" imposed on financial corporations will be abolished. The biggest lorries - but only the biggest - will be exempted from much of the duty they now pay. For big business, Britain is already one of the world's most luxurious tax resorts. In 1979, corporation tax stood at 52%. After successive Conservative and Labour cuts, it has been reduced to 30%. This, Gordon Brown boasted last year, is ""now the lowest rate in the history of British corporation tax, the lowest rate of any major country in Europe and the lowest rate of any major industrialised country anywhere, including Japan and the United States"". Mr Brown claims that he wants to wage war on tax havens. But, under his guidance, Britain is becoming one of the worst.  It is not hard to see why this is happening. More mobile than ever before, big businesses can bully governments into relieving them of their responsibilities. If a state won't cut the taxes it levies, they threaten to disinvest, and move to somewhere which will. By these means they have been able to shift the burden of taxation, worldwide, from the rich to the poor and middle- incomed. Fifty years ago, corporation taxes in the United States rendered more than 30% of federal revenues, which was more than the union received from personal taxation. Now they account for just 12%, a quarter of the amount delivered by personal tax. While the Confederation of British Industry clamours for cuts in corporate taxes, it has also lobbied  against cuts in consumer taxes. It wants the money spent, instead, on public infrastructure, providing lucrative contracts for business.  Personal taxation has not been growing evenly. The highly paid, like the corporations which employ them, are mobile, and can play one state off against another. The poor are forbidden to move, so their taxes remain as high as their weakened democracies allow. They pay their immobility tax, and reap the insecurity caused by this global race to the bottom.  The great corporate tax rebate, in other words, mirrors the great corporate handout. Before it came to power, Labour hinted that it would stop doling out money to big business. But it reckoned without the protection racket big companies now operate in Britain, threatening to clear out and take the economy with them if they don't get what they want. Last week it gave £530m to BAe, to persuade it to build its new jet here rather than elsewhere.   Some economists have suggested that the subsidies corporations receive from governments now outweigh the total tax they pay.  Big business has further reduced its contributions by means of ingenious tax avoidance strategies. Rupert Murdoch's British holding company, Newscorp Investments, has managed to pay no net British corporation tax on the £1.4bn in profits it has made since 1988. As companies move their transactions on to the internet - a shift encouraged by this week's Budget - their business will become both more opaque and even more mobile. They will install their servers where taxes are lowest, disguise their trade in goods as a trade in services, and even launch their own virtual currencies. The British inventor of one internet currency - beenz - appears to understand the implications. ""I wouldn't want to be working for the Inland Revenue when it happens,"" he says.  The tax burden, in other words, is shifting to those who are unable to move their assets either offshore or out of the old economy and into cyberspace. While the beggar-thy-neighbour economics that Gordon Brown practises hurt rich countries, the poor are wounded still more gravely. With little else to offer, poor countries end up giving everything away in a desperate attempt to undercut their rivals and attract ""investment"". If, in other words, taxation is not to become wholly regressive all over the world, we will have to revolutionise the means by which the rich are charged.   Some innovative schemes have been proposed. The ""Tobin tax"", for example, would penalise short-term financial speculation. If it were collected internationally, it could fund, for example, the United Nations, and pay for development and emergency programmes. War on Want calculates that a 0.25% tax would raise an annual £250bn. The ""total consumption tax"" proposed by Professor Robert Frank would exploit the gap between richer people's incomes and savings, levying steep tariffs on the purchase of luxury goods. Land taxation would make use of one of the few assets big business can't move. Some people have proposed a ""bit tax"", imposed on all electronic communications. This, though, is surely just as likely to punish the impoverished internet anorak (or, for that matter, the information-hungry Guardian columnist) as the tax-exempt corporate predator.  But it seems to me that we need to be still bolder. Perhaps it is time to give serious consideration to the idea of a global corporation tax.  The corporations have, so far, succeeded in globalising everything except their obligations. Their rights have been harmonised, while their responsibilities have been shed. They have ensured that international bodies such as the World   Trade Organisation establish only maximum standards for corporate behaviour, rather than minimum standards. We need to turn this formula around, obliging corporations to respond to human needs. And among the measures we should force on them is a fixed rate of business tax, payable by companies wherever they trade.  This would not be easy either to implement or to enforce. It would hand a formidable advantage to countries playing outside the rules, as corporations would flock to them just as they flock to tax havens today. But it is possible to conceive of a system of sanctions, rather like the sanctions imposed today upon countries seeking to protect their markets.  None of this could work without the democratisation of global treaty-making: prior parliamentary approval of all national negotiating positions, for example, and referenda on important   decisions. But this needs to happen anyway: corporations have been able to extract such advantages from globalisation only because they have been able to keep the public out of international decision-making. Governments will reassert their control over corporations when people reassert their control over governments.  Global taxation will be troublesome and politically hazardous. But whether we intervene or not, corporate taxes will converge worldwide, but downwards, rather than upwards. If business is not forced to redistribute its wealth, then the rich will roam the world, free of obligations, while the rest of us will be left to support society, the state and even the corporations through an ever more onerous immobility tax."
8,"All the newspaper metaphors had the sort of literary associations that can be recognised by people who have not read many books. First he was TS Eliot's mystery cat - no more than an excuse to write that whenever the prime minister needs helping out of a jam, in the manner of Macavity, Gordon Brown's not there. Then he was said to be like the dog that aroused Sherlock Holmes' interest and suspicion because it did not bark. Comparisons with Shergar, the disappearing thoroughbred, were only prevented by the near certainty that, when the next big Labour party leadership race is run, the chancellor of the exchequer will win at a canter. Attempts to discover if he was asked to speak up for Tony Blair during the bizarre debate about the proper treatment of the Queen Mother's corpse were dismissed with the weary implication that there was no point in Downing Street issuing an invitation which was certain to be refused. And there is no doubt that Brown's regular detractors spread the word that, if the Treasury is not directly involved in a fiasco, there is no hope of the chancellor coming to the aid of the party. But lofty disdain for the trivia of government makes Gordon Brown Labour's most bankable asset. One day even his most critical colleagues will feel only gratitude and relief that the worst that can be said about him is that he possesses a puritanical determination to distinguish between the deserving and the undeserving poor.  William Ewart Gladstone said that, in politics, things are best done by those who believe in them. It is hard to imagine the intellectually fastidious Gordon Brown arguing with any conviction that the idea of the prime minister walking down Whitehall to greet the Queen Mother's coffin emanated from the foreign secretary's discovery that the sun was shining and that Her Majesty's ministers would enjoy the fresh air. If he was the sort of man who willingly repeated the official line on Newsnight, he would just be another run-of-the-mill party politician. After all, we never read predictions that John Reid will be the next prime minister.  Nobody who recalls the grace with which he faced his daughter's death or heard the eulogy which he delivered at Donald Dewar's funeral can doubt that there is a human being inside Gordon Brown's invariably charcoal grey suit. But his addiction to work and the certainty that what he is doing at the moment is more important than anything that occupies anyone else, does make him a difficult colleague. It also attracts the criticism that his single-mindedness is self-centred. Had the consolation notes to recent ministerial rejects been signed by any other minister, they would not have rated even a gossip column mention. But we all assume that Gordon Brown does everything on purpose. No doubt the next leadership election is always at the back of his mind. And he does not seem to realise he is already close to invincible. Yet he persists in making progress toward the summit of the greasy pole on his own terms.  A couple of weeks ago Gordon Brown gave the Aneurin Bevan Memorial Lecture. The chairman, Geoffrey Goodman, once the doyen of labour correspondents and still an authority on Labour politics, described the speech as ""what the party has been waiting for since 1997"". Most members will have to go on waiting. No text was available. The chancellor spoke from extended notes. A member of the audience believed that had the lecture been widely reported, hundreds of party members, tempted to resign in disillusion, would have stayed to support Gordon Brown. As Mark Antony almost said, ambition should be made of more assiduous stuff. Eventually, after much prompting and the chancellor's insistence that he did the job himself, the notes were made into continuous prose and one newspaper thought them sufficiently important to be given some late attention. However, on the day before publication Stephen Byers resigned. All available space was needed for the obsequies and the ministerial reshuffle which followed. Gordon Brown said not a word on either subject.  And quite right too. What has the government gained by John Prescott's allegation that Byers was stabbed in the back or, for that matter, what advantage has been achieved by David Blunkett's suggestion that the newspapers are on the verge of lunacy? Gordon Brown's belief that he has better things to do than slug it out with the tabloid newspapers is an immense encouragement to people who think that politics should be a battle of ideas not images. God willing the spasm of playground politics has now ended. If there is another outbreak of juvenilia, the government in general and Tony Blair in particular have the strongest possible vested interest in keeping Gordon Brown above the fatuous battle."
8,"Twenty-five years ago, almost to the day, Jim Callaghan's government was defeated in a vote of confidence. The enforced general election that followed opened the way for the injustices and inequalities that we now call Thatcherism. In one sense, the anniversary is unimportant. The idea that there are moments in history when the world suddenly turns upside down is a romantic conceit. If the shot across the bridge at Concord had not echoed round the world in 1775, the American colonists would still have cried freedom. And it was Germany's long-held imperial pretensions, not the assassination at Sarajevo, that caused the first world war. But that late March evening back in 1979 at least symbolises the end of one era and the beginning of another. Now, we are told, it need never have happened.  Labour whips had spent the previous week struggling to construct a House of Commons majority. I was deputed to convince two working-class Ulster Unionist MPs that Northern Ireland's interests would best be served by the government's survival. The mission was accomplished. But two other Ulster men, who normally supported Callaghan, defected for reasons that were lost in the mist of Celtic obscurity. As the division approached, it became clear that we were still one vote short. The agony of impending defeat was increased by the fact that we knew who that one vote was.  Sir Alfred ""Doc"" Broughton, the 77-year-old MP for Batley and Morley, was mortally ill. Had he been brought to the Commons by ambulance and kept ""in the precincts"" while the division took place, he could have been ""nodded through"" the lobby and his vote recorded. But the journey might have killed him. I was unhesitatingly in favour of taking the risk. So - much to his credit - was he. His courage was, however, confounded by the compassion of the Labour leadership.  We now discover that Walter Harrison, deputy government chief whip, approached Bernard Wetherill, his opposition counterpart, with the demand that the sick man be ""paired"". On radio last week, both men discussed what followed. The account of their negotiations will, to say the least, surprise those Labour MPs who lost their seats in the 1979 general election.  Wetherill first insisted that ""pairs"" were never provided for votes of confidence. The government, if it wanted to survive, must marshal all its forces. Harrison replied that the refusal was a breach of faith. Anxious to defend his honour, Wetherill offered to sit out the division himself - simultaneously matching Broughton's absence and destroying his own career.   Touched by the act of chivalry, Harrison told him that he could not accept such a sacrifice. Wetherill voted. The Labour government lost, and Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.  Listening to the radio discussion, I got the distinct impression that the two men expected their audience to be impressed. Wetherill was undoubtedly justified in his rejoicing. He won. But Harrison had elevated his definition of gentlemanly conduct above the interests of the whole Labour party. His duty was to defeat the vote of confidence, not behave like a boy scout.  Harrison is entitled to argue that the prime minister could have absolved him from the responsibility of choosing between conscience and duty. Enoch Powell had offered to lead all his Unionist friends into the government lobby in payment for the promise that a gas pipeline would be laid between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Jim Callaghan rightly refused to put the government up for auction. He went down on a point of principle. But a question still hangs over both men's decision. Did they matter anyway?  Had either or both of them behaved differently - and the election been postponed until the autumn - would the rancid tide of Thatcherism have been held back? During the last week of the election campaign, Callaghan himself said that the country's mood had turned and that Labour's day was done. Harrison can say, in his own defence, that - even if the vote of censure had been lost - the inevitable would have only been postponed.  Two great planks in Labour's policy platform had been destroyed. After the ""winter of discontent"", the trade unions no longer seemed an unequivocal force for good. And, by arguing in favour of the IMF agreement, we had all added to the calumny that high levels of public expenditure are the root of all evil. Perhaps there was an even deeper reason for Labour's rejection.  Britain had lost confidence in collective and co-operative effort and begun to believe that individualism was the secret of success. Even if we had not held the election at a time of Mrs Thatcher's choice, we might have lost. But I still wish we had been given the chance to find out."
8,"These are difficult days for doctors. Harold Shipman was recognised as an aberration, but almost every week since his conviction there has been a new headline about what sceptics regard as characteristic medical incompetence or malpractice. Pathologists steal body parts. General practitioners declare themselves plastic surgeons and leave women scarred for life. Paediatricians' cardiac experiments result in the death of 35 children. Radiologists fail to notice cancer symptoms in 82 women examined in the breast screening programme.  The revelations of the radiologists' failure came at a bad time for the profession. The Kennedy report into the Bristol baby deaths had revealed a ""secret society culture"" in which people advance ""in their careers by not rocking the boat"". As if to confirm that analysis, the General Medical Council behaved like the membership committee of a country club, exactly the complaint that was made against Bristol doctors who should have exposed the cardiac experiments. The errant radiologists were found guilty but not struck off.   I know that the majority of doctors are conscientious and overworked. During the six weeks before my mother's death, I witnessed the devotion with which the staff at a great northern hospital cared for a ward of geriatrics whose conditions were beyond surgery but who responded to the palliative treatment which made their last days bearable. It made me proud to support the National Health Service. But I still understand why patients, or more likely their anxious relatives, are in a mood to inquire into the record of a surgeon before the knife goes in.   Some patients always did. The articulate, self-confident middle classes always talked on equal terms with doctors. In my asthmatic childhood, we never sent for Dr Stevens to give me the early morning adrenalin injection until the grate had been cleared and a new fire laid. I do not recall the date of my emancipation. But I do remember that when it was thought, wrongly, that I must have my gall bladder removed, David Owen offered to make inquiries about the surgeon in whose hands my life would be. His words were: ""If somebody is going to cut a two-foot hole in your stomach, you need to know that he's up to the job.""   Alan Milburn's independent office for information on health care performance will give the reticent masses a chance to influence their own surgical destiny. It may improve the levels of performance. And it will help to provide the feeling of confidence so important during the time that the trolley is being wheeled from the ward to the theatre. Everyone who believes that we should empower ""the people of England who have not spoken yet"" will welcome the idea.   So will the more sensible doctors. Few patients now are prepared to carry notes of their condition from one doctor to another without tearing open the sealed envelope. The age of deference is not quite dead. But it is dying. No general practitioner or cardiac surgeon has anything to gain from it being replaced, among the timid patient population, by an age of resentment. And that is what would happen following the recent revelations if the tragedies were brushed aside as mistakes which doctors must be allowed to deal with themselves. Worse would follow. Patients who dared not argue with their doctors face to face would increasingly sue for negligence (whether their complaint was justified or not) as the only way of breaking into the magic circle.   The critics are right to say that the publication of complicated information has its dangers. Misinterpretation by the uninitiated is always too easy. So it is important that the medical performance statistics, unlike the schools' examination results figures, are not used as if they were scores in a competition which ends with a championship trophy. With the promised help of the professional associations that can be avoided. Lord Hunt, the junior health minister said so on the radio, and I always accept what he says. Anyone who was able simultaneously to be the secretary of both the Association of Health Authorities and the Sparkbrook constituency Labour party must be a man of formidably eclectic talent.   When he was a councillor and I was an MP in Birmingham's inner city, I doubt we met many people who would openly challenge a doctor's opinion or performance. The dissatisfied patients accepted whatever was prescribed and complained to us afterwards. Politicians, quite rightly, are not surrounded by mystique. Doctors, quite wrongly, too often are. The acceptance that even one small part of the profession shall be monitored will help to destroy the myths. Knowledge is power. The more it is spread the better. What about lawyers next?"
8,"On the evidence of his article in last Thursday's Guardian, when Peter Mandelson calls for New Labour to ""renew"" itself, he really means that he wants the party within the party to go on behaving as it always did. Not even the cliches have changed and the old vacuities are repeated in their well-worn form. No one can complain about the demand for more ""investment in infrastructure"". Indeed its shortcoming as a defining policy is its universal popularity. The real problem, which politicians must face, is how to bring that desirable aim about. To write ""Who cares whether it is publicly or privately financed as long as it actually happens and is well managed?"" is a perfect example of how to ask a question and beg it at the same time.  Mandelson seems unable to realise that those of us who believe that the public services should be publicly financed are not crazy ideologues. We subscribe to RH Tawney's view that questions of nationalisation are best decided after examination of specific industries rather than by ringing declarations of principle. In some areas of the economy, the high levels of investment and good management that Mandelson craves are more likely to be provided by public rather than by private enterprise. Ironically, that view reflects New Labour's pragmatic demand to support ""what works"". It is the government - with its doctrinal faith in the market and free enterprise - that has elevated prejudice above experience.    As I began to read Mandelson's article I hoped that he had at last recognised that simple truth. Transport was omitted from the list of government triumphs. That omission illustrated, at least by implication, an increasingly obvious fact. Most of the government's successes - redistribution in favour of the working poor - have been Old Labour successes. Almost all the failures (the railways being a perfect example) have been New Labour failures. Although his silence on the subject of transport suggests that Mandelson realises what went wrong, most of his article reflects a depressing willingness to make the same mistakes again.   Of course, the railway system suffered from 18 years of Tory neglect. But New Labour has four years of complacent inactivity to live down. The mistakes began in an area of politics in which Mandelson used to specialise - public perception. Back in 1995, it was assumed that the key middle-class voters in marginal constituencies were against nationalisation in any form. The promise to bring Railtrack back into public ownership had to be broken in order to demonstrate a clean break with Old Labour. Incredibly, the prime   minister actually said so on the Frost programme yesterday. Never mind the evidence, read the opinion polls.   Unfortunately the opinion polls got it wrong. So did the focus groups. New Labour was (and for all I know may still be) committed to ""continuous democracy"" - an election-winning technique invented by Dick Morris, one of President Clinton's confidants. According to his theory, a government that wants a second term must make a new announcement every day and the announcement must always coincide with the majority view of the voting public. Leadership thus becomes a dangerous extravagance.   Philip Gould imported the ""rule of 50%"" from America and advised the PM about which policies he should adopt in order to keep a majority of the volatile voters on his side. At the time when the government should have been pouring money into the railways, Gould concluded that the general public were not very worried about transport. I expect that he said the subject had a ""low salience"".   Perhaps he was right at the time. It has a high salience now.   Ministers have taken to whispering that the Railtrack catastrophe is all John Prescott's fault. He is an ideal scapegoat - Old Labour in attitude and appearance if not in philosophy, on the wrong side of 60 and destined for oblivion. He was certainly in charge during the years of complacent neglect, but nobody who has ever talked to him for more than five minutes could possibly doubt his enthusiasm for more investment in transport. Perhaps he was overruled.   And still the platitudes are trotted out as an alternative to thought. ""We should adopt the fiscal and exchange rate policies that puts the needs of investment before a consumer boom."" I doubt if even Nigel Lawson, who chose the opposite in 1987, now disagrees. But how do we achieve the desired objective in those public services where returns on capital are low and shareholders demand - as the Company Act allows - that their interests are put first? Perhaps the strategic plan for railways, due to be published today, will answer that question convincingly. If it does, it will either break new economic ground or repudiate New Labour thinking."
8,"Tony Blair ought to be hugging himself with delight. The events of Budget week (putting aside the mild embarrassment they may have occasioned by confirming that Gordon Brown really runs the country) immensely enhanced the prime minister's reputation among people who once doubted his intellectual capacity to steer a steady political course. Indeed, the whole health service package - the way the money will be spent as well as raised - came very near to vindicating his theory of government. Last week, the third way arrived in Whitehall. Like the idea or not, critics can no longer dismiss it as a name looking for a theory to which it can attach itself.  On Wednesday morning, the front pages of the Tory newspapers read like the lurid bits in the Book of Revelation. The great beast - better known as old Labour - had risen out of the earth and the Two Horsemen of the Modern Apocalypse, Tax and Spend, were galloping through suburban England. But by Thursday, there was a new heaven and a new earth. The same newspapers announced that the health service reforms - on which the increased national insurance contributions were to be spent - replicated Tory plans to bring the discipline of the market into the provision of medical care. The Blair philosophy is to mix and hope that there is a match.   I remain entirely sceptical about the possibility of the health service crisis being resolved by a free enterprise solution. It costs more to build a hospital by the private finance initiative than it does to pay for it out of public funds and the quality of service usually deteriorates when entrepreneurs replace public servants. The idea that by ""introducing the market into state monopolies"", risk is transferred from government to private companies is a myth. A hospital could not be allowed to go bankrupt and out of business. The rigours of competition will not make surgeons perform appendicectomies more quickly.   None of those objections to ""privatising the health service"" is ideological. They are all an accountant's complaints. John Redwood (not a doctrinal socialist) will forgive me for repeating a comment he made to me after we appeared together on Question Time. The private sector had, he said, ""taken the government for a ride"" by pretending it would accept the risks of involvement in public services. It would accept the profits and claim compensation for the losses. Perhaps the prime minister was initially happy to be conned. The arrangement allowed him to point to his partnership with business as proof that he was truly New Labour. But you do not have to be old Labour to object to the government throwing money away.    The only item of old Labour ideology that really matters is the commitment to greater equality. The budget, the biggest overt redistribution of income for 20 years, proclaimed as well as implemented that principle. The debate about how the money is spent ought to be more practical than philosophic. If private enterprise can make an egalitarian health service more efficient, its involvement should be welcomed. If it cannot, it must be rejected.   The examination of the Blair government's record has been profoundly prejudiced by the notion that its critics are filled by a nostalgia for what used to be. And the artificial division between old and new has been exploited by a prime minister who recognised the electoral appeal of a fresh start. The budget was right because it redistributed the nation's income - an objective associated with past Labour governments more as a result of what they preached than as a consequence of what they practised. The health service reforms may be a mistake not because they are, in Labour terms, an innovation, but because they seem unlikely to achieve their stated objective.   Foolishly, critics of privatisation have allowed themselves to be represented as public enterprise Bourbons, who have forgotten how dissatisfied we all were with the monolithic state-owned utilities. When prominent members of the present cabinet were arguing for the nationalisation of 100, or was it 1,000, commanding heights of the economy, I was doing my best to prevent the government wasting its money on acquiring the shipbuilding and aerospace industries. Public versus private ought to be a question of judgment, not faith.   Yet anyone who questions the transcendental efficiency of private enterprise is caricatured as a Stalinist obsessed with state control. It is the supporters of the ""project"" who are addicted to an unreasonable theory. They believe, despite all the evidence, that private enterprise can solve all the public sector's problems. There are legitimate reservations about the proposed health reforms that are purely pragmatic. But they will be described as doctrinaire because they are advanced by pragmatists who are labelled old rather than New Labour. If there is to be a sensible debate on these subjects, there needs to be an end to adjectives."
8,"The New Labour leadership is at its least attractive when its members are at their most unctuous. And when the assurance, ""you can trust me"", is used as an obvious refuge from the necessity to conduct a rational argument, the politician who stands on his self-righteous dignity becomes absurd as well as an electoral liability. Unfortunately, there is no way of calculating how many votes John Reid lost for the government last week when he expressed the affront that he felt at the suggestion that, from time to time, the Downing Street press office attempts to manipulate the news. Doctor Reid - pretender to the title of Labour party chairman - was attempting to explain away the unfortunate comparison he had made between the security alert at London's Heathrow airport and the destruction of the World Trade Centre twin towers in which 3,000 people died. Part of his bluster was a refutation of the allegation that tanks at Heathrow were part of a publicity stunt designed to reconcile a reluctant nation to war. What sort of people, he asked, would exploit the tragedies of war in order to manipulate the press?  One possible case immediately came to mind. The sort of people who had pretended that a research student's out-of-date thesis, speculating about the possibility of a terrorist attack, was an up-to-the-minute intelligence report predicting that one was likely to happen. And that was only one example of the dubious techniques which have been employed to justify almost every contentious aspect of government policy.  That ministers behave in that way is now taken for granted by a nation which may still be offended, but is no longer surprised by revelations of dubious conduct. Twenty years ago, the valedictory comments of the retiring controller of the audit commission would have produced splash headlines in every national newspaper. Now the discovery that ministers tried to doctor his report to disguise the failure of PSI school building programmes only justifies half-a-dozen column inches. We all know that sort of thing goes on.  The Gulf war has done no more than draw attention to a bad old habit. Last week, attempting to construct a moral justification for invading Iraq, the prime minister told the House of Commons that sanctions - as manipulated by Saddam Hussein - were denying essential vitamins to Iraq's children and vital drugs to Iraq's hospitals. The implication that opponents of the war are supporters of sanctions - or that without a war sanctions must continue - is clearly ridiculous. But it was not very different from the equally preposterous allegations he has made about the   quality of teaching in this country - designed to justify changes in the organisation of schools which were intended to attract suburban votes rather than improve the quality of education. Saying whatever is convenient at the moment can only lead to eventual ridicule.  Yet ministers still also say, ""trust me"". I recall the prime minister making that plea at the time of the Bernie Ecclestone ""cash for cigarette advertising"" scandal. And I remember writing in this column that I did not believe that Tony Blair had come to an improper agreement with the motor-racing industry. That is still my position. But I have no doubt that by repeating today my faith in his innate honesty, I have provoked half the readers of the column into wondering if I have gone soft or been bought off - buying off being part of the fashion of our time.  Trust is indivisible. It cannot be enjoyed occasionally, or in part. Once it is lost, it is almost impossible for it to be regained. I retain my faith in Tony Blair as a basically honest politician. But the lapses   by him, or the people around him, have (at very best) put that reputation in jeopardy. And it has put at risk the esteem in which thoroughly honest ministers - the Browns, the Darlings, the Hoons and the rest - are held.  Five years ago, the prime minister could have won a single European currency referendum on the slogan, ""Trust me"". Not today. It is the lack of trust which has produced the slump in the Labour party opinion poll ratings - not opposition to war in itself, but a refusal to accept the government's word that war is necessary.  People like me, open-minded six months ago, now ask themselves why, if there is a logical case for deposing Saddam - the possession of weapons combined with a tangible threat of their use - do ministers resort to such obviously phoney arguments?  Doubts about a government's honesty would, normally, guarantee general election defeat, however great its majority. But the reduction in the prime minister's popularity has come at just the right moment to rescue Iain Duncan Smith. Why, his supporters will ask, change leader just as the revival begins? So, thanks to the ineptitude of the opposition, Labour will win again. Perhaps, in politics, it is better to be lucky than to be trusted.    <BR>"
8,"Perhaps I have spent too much time recently reviewing books about British espionage operations during the second world war. Whatever the reason, I cannot help speculating about the possibility that Iain Duncan Smith has been ""planted"" on the Tories by the forces of reason and radicalism and instructed to make sure the Conservative party never forms a government again. Most of the British agents captured in occupied France were victims of over-confidence - aces of sabotage so blatant that their true identities became obvious. How else is it possible to explain the appointment of Barry Legg as the chief executive of the Conservative party? Mr Legg is a comparatively young man who became very rich very quickly. There is nothing to complain about in that. Indeed, we should be impressed that, even as he was acquiring his sudden wealth, he always made time for public service. Councillor Legg was chief whip of the Conservative group, which controlled Westminster local government under the leadership of Dame Shirley Porter. Unfortunately, Dame Shirley will not be a guest at the party to celebrate his appointment as Duncan Smith's right-hand man. She is in Israel, a fugitive from the district auditor, who requires her to pay a surcharge of £26.5m as the penalty for attempting to secure re-election by selling council houses to potential Tory voters.  It would be quite wrong to find the Tories' new chief executive guilty by association with the perpetrators of what Lord Bingham, while he dismissed their appeal against the surcharge, described as ""a deliberate, blatant and dishonest use of public power"" - especially so since the district auditor absolved Legg of wilful misconduct. But he is entitled to more than a footnote in the history of the squalid affair. ""I find as a fact,"" wrote the district auditor in his report, ""that councillor Legg knew it was wrong for the council to exercise its powers in order to secure an increase in the number of likely Conservative votes in marginal wards. In such circumstances, a member has a duty to speak up.""  Is it possible that Duncan Smith - mesmerised by ex-councillor Legg's Euroscepticism - had forgotten his new colleague's role in the homes-for-votes scandal? Or does the new Tory leader regard turning a blind eye as an acceptable response to the discovery of politically advantageous wrongdoing? And - public morality aside - can the Tory leader really imagine that the other parties will forget the position Legg occupied when Dame Shirley organised the biggest political gerrymander in British history? Hundreds of council tenants were left in damp and decaying tenements because the houses that were rightfully theirs were allocated to Tory sympathisers. Believe me, Legg's tenure as chief whip on the Westminster city council will be mentioned during the next general election campaign.  The Shirley Porter inheritance - hanging round Legg's neck like a slime-covered millstone - will hugely prejudice the Tory party's reputation with the general public. But the beauty of his appointment - at least from my point of view - is that he will also cause mayhem within what is left of the Tory party. I have no idea whether or not he was recruited in a way that violates the Tories' constitution. And I have no doubt Duncan Smith's associates are right to describe Theresa May - Legg's principal critic - as an ""airhead"". But, all that said, what benefit does Duncan Smith believe he derives from surrounding himself with UK Independence party sympathisers, who made life hell for John Major during the dying days of the last Tory government?  Duncan Smith, who made his name by undermining his leader, relies on the cynical message of John Harrington's epigram, ""Treason doth never prosper: what's the reason? For if it prosper none dare call it treason."" But in modern politics - believe it or not - men and women retain a residual loyalty to old heroes. The brightest and best of the modern Tory party did not look upon Major with unqualified awe or admiration. They recalled that he was the Thatcherite leadership candidate whose mission was to save her party from One Nation Conservatism. But they still deeply resent the way a handful of fanatical anti-Europeans assiduously undermined him and brought down his government. Now, thanks to Duncan Smith, those rebels occupy more and more power within the party. It is as though, after 1979, Michael Foot had annointed the trade unionists who refused to bury the Liverpool dead.  Duncan Smith was right, last Thursday, when he told the Today programme that the political debate is not about the state of the Tory party. But that is only because its prospects have already been written off. Legg's appointment merely confirms that all Duncan Smith now hopes for is the loyalty of the section of his party that exists outside mainstream British politics."
8,"We all accept that Christmas has become the feast of Mammon - the season of goodwill to all shopkeepers when normally prudent families worship the baby born in the manger by distributing tawdry gifts they have seen advertised on television. Now a new red letter day has appeared in the commercial calendar. Good Friday is the beginning of the festival of furniture. Real worshippers at the shrine of ""inspirational leather and fabric sofas"" may argue that the celebration of settees, chairs and beds is a movable feast. For every week there are television commercials advertising specially reduced prices that are available only for the next few days. As one offer ends another, miraculously, begins. But this Easter we are witnessing what amounts to a furniture crusade.  Tabloid newspapers have joined forces with commercial television companies to advertise Harvey's Easter Collection, Courts' Easter Weekend, Multiyork's Easter Sale, Laura Ashley's Easter Weekend of Made to Measure Furniture and dfs, where ""everything is half-price this Easter"". Other companies are en fte but make no mention of the end of holy week. They all have one thing in common. They offer their potential customers extraordinary terms.  The dfs offer is typical. ""Take four years' free credit and pay nothing for the first year."" Unless dfs (a ""licensed credit broker"") loses money on the lending side of its business, someone is paying interest on the capital which finances the deals. So we must assume that another little explanation - alongside ""subject to acceptance"" - might have been added to the advertisement. It would read ""debt charges included in the price"". But the company can legitimately claim (in rather larger print): APR 0%.  So it is possible, today, to acquire a ""corner group in navy blue leather, previous price £1,798"" for £897, sit on it for a year without paying a penny and then dispose of the outstanding debt at the rate of £24.91 a month until April 2008. Say what you will about blue leather, the offer is clearly what, in the days of old-fashioned hire purchase, we called ""easy terms"". Indeed, the terms are a great deal too easy for the health of the economy.  Ever since the Tories bought the 1987 general election with an orgy of debt deregulation, Britain has borrowed far beyond its collective means. Low interest rates - part of the government's admirable and wholly successful campaign to secure full employment - removed the fiscal incentive to save first and buy later. The national psyche is represented by the trade union chant of 20 years ago: ""What do we want? Everything! When do we want it? Now!"" The SCS offer, ""Be yourself for less"", might be the motto of our time.  The idea of credit controls is so alien to government thinking that it took some time - admittedly on a Good Friday - and two immensely obliging information officers to determine whether we are allowed, under EU regulations, to return to the old system. Personal credit is the responsibility of the DTI, but its implications for fiscal policy (and what we used to call demand management) naturally remain within the Treasury. Both eventually agreed that ministers could, if they wanted to, reduce the amount of borrowing by setting out minimum deposits and maximum repayment periods. But this is the age of the individual. We all have an inalienable right to ruin ourselves and damage the economy.  The furniture trade is only the padded end of the credit wedge. Its success is very largely dependent on the existence of various forms of lending - bank loans, credit cards and the several conveniences which enable reckless buyers to pay their £24.91 a month to dfs and still discharge all the other careless liabilities which they have taken on. It may well be that were such credit outlets to be restricted, the economy would collapse like a punctured balloon. But payments as easy as those offered by dfs make me uneasy.  My objection to credit has nothing to do with personal morality. I left university with an unauthorised overdraft and immediately made hire purchase agreements to buy the first furniture I ever owned. I was sometimes late with the payments. And, when I bought a car, I borrowed the deposit from a more affluent friend. Sometimes I speculate about what would have happened in the early swinging 60s if cheap and easy loans had been as freely available as they are today.  Television advertisements provide a clue to the answer. A new industry has sprung up within the financial services sector. The companies which make it up ""refinance"" debt - sometimes by taking the debtor's house as security. They advertise their wares on late-night television. Satisfied customers sing the system's praises. They were, they say, oppressed by their liabilities until they discovered the advantages of borrowing one big loan. Casualties of the system never appear."
8,"I blame the Tory party. The Conservatives have become so hopelessly irrelevant that the old inhibitions on disagreement and dissent no longer apply. No one in government cares if the opposition asks, ""If they cannot agree among themselves, how can they hope to run the country?"" For everybody knows that the job is not going to be offered to Iain Duncan Smith. There is no incentive to avoid trouble. No matter how hard the boat is rocked, it is not going to sink. Six months of open warfare between the trade unions and the Labour party will not change the electoral history of Britain. There may even be young advisers in Downing Street who tell the prime minister that the more he dismisses the demands of organised labour (representing the working class) the greater will become the prospects of a permanent Blairite hegemony. We can be sure that sentiment will not bind him to the trade unions and we know that in terms of labour market policy he has more in common with Silvio Berlusconi than John Monks.  So he will let the public sector disputes fester on, willing to see the breach widened before the wounds are healed by some sort of conciliation. But the trade unions have nothing to gain from the events of the last few months - threats of reduced subscriptions, strikes in public service industries and wild speeches from general secretaries who are not even Labour party members - becoming the pattern for the rest of the year and beyond. The prospect of New Labour creating the sort of society that they want to see depends on them treading softly and maximising their influence rather than intensifying their protests.  No doubt most of their claims are justified. At a moment when the country stands poised on the brink of the European single currency, it is difficult to argue that British workers should accept every sort of integration except the harmonisation of industrial relations law. And, principles aside, an improvement in public sector pay is a practical necessity if the long-promised reform of public services is to evolve from rhetoric to reality.  But none of the long-term items on the trade unions' agenda will be achieved by shock tactics. Social justice depends on a return to social democracy. An increasingly dissatisfied rank and file will continue to demand a change of course. Only the trade unions, working from inside the party, have the strength to bring it about.  It was not Labour's constituency parties, passionately though they felt on the subject, that persuaded David Blunkett to replace the odious asylum seekers' voucher scheme with cash subsistence payments. It was the Transport and General Workers Union. Other changes have to be made in the same way.   That is not easy for a union in which the general secretary owes his or her allegiance to one of the no-hope organisations on the wilder shores of politics and supports palpably silly resolutions that force ministers to resign their membership of the union. So the unions should work with the grain of the party. We are at the point in Labour's history where they have to make the choice that they once accused party activists of ducking - emotionally satisfying but essentially impotent gestures or real, but limited, influence. The alternatives they choose may well determine the future of radical politics in this country.  I have argued in this column that a permanent separation, or even a formal divorce, from Labour might give the trade unions a freedom of action that they could use to their members' advantage. Some trade unions (out of frustration) and some newspapers (out of malice) now argue for that course.  For the party the result would be ideological disaster, compounding the political errors the trade unions made in the late 1990s. By believing that all that mattered was a leader who could guarantee victory, they got the party into the New Labour mess. Now they have a duty to get the party out of it. The combined block vote could have prevented Tony Blair from emasculating the party conference and ignoring the men and women who would have argued for real Labour policies. They abdicated and must now make amends.  There was method in his marginalisation. Voices that would have been raised against the part-privatisation of the public services, the gradual return to selective secondary education and the imposition of unwanted and unrepresentative parliamentary candidates, have been stilled. The objections to new Thatcherism are as strong as they ever were. But the new constitution does not allow them to be expressed by rank-and-file party members. The trade unions have an obligation to do the job for them.  A summer of discontent will achieve nothing. It will take years of methodical and often tedious argument to set Labour back on the long and winding road to socialism. The unions should pay their subscriptions, vote their full strength and save the party they created."
8,"Is it possible that 80% of the British population want the 2012 Olympic Games to be held in London? My scepticism about that particular finding is as much the result of my faith in the common sense of this happy breed as the consequence of my contempt for much of what goes on in the modern Olympiad. It is, at least for me, impossible to argue that the importance of snowboarding and figure skating is not winning but taking part. And, these days, the main objective of even the genuinely athletic events is not so much running fast and jumping high as making money. If there was a modern Roger Bannister who thought that qualifying as a doctor was his most important task, but still broke and held world records, I might be tempted to join the demand for a British bid. As things stand, I do not care which city hosts the international festival of exploitation.  Nor should the British public - whatever their view on the character-building qualities of beach volleyball. For, wherever the games are held, rank-and-file sports enthusiasts will be left outside the stadium. Most of the seats will be reserved for dubious VIPs' ""corporate hospitality"" or sold by travel agents who market expensive package deals of flights, hotels and restaurants with a quick visit to the women's 200m final thrown in.  For the rest of us, watching the games on television in our living rooms, it does not matter whether the tracks and fields are in London, Rome, Geneva or Reykjavik. The outstanding question is, are we prepared to pay between £2bn and £5bn for the privilege of broadcasting the Olympics from London?  Officially, the government has still to come off the Olympic fence, but it is possible to judge which way it is wobbling by the figure it chooses to accept as the full cost. The Ove Arap estimate of £2bn, dismissed a month or so ago as far too low, is back in favour. So we must assume that, at the moment, Tony Blair wants the British bid to go ahead.  One billion will be subscribed by the lottery and what is mysteriously called ""other non-governmental sources"" and Ken Livingstone has agreed that the other billion can be raised by a precept on the London council tax. Spread over 10 years, the addition to the tax bill will, it is hoped, be hardly noticed, quickly forgotten and barely resented. Manchester helped to pay for the Commonwealth Games and Sheffield accepted part of the International Student Games bill. According to David Blunkett, council leader at the time, Sheffield's price included the defeat of the Labour party in the local elections.   This year the government sees bidding for the Olympics as a way of avoiding potential political damage. The International Olympic Committee will make its decision in July 2005 - two months after, or three months before, the most likely dates for the next general election. How much better to face the electorate after at least attempting to make Britain the centre of the sporting universe than risk the accusation that New Labour lacks the confidence or the courage to do what Los Angeles, Munich and Sydney have done? From out of the past comes the echo of John Prescott urging the cabinet to carry on the development of the dome. ""If we can't do this, we can't do anything.""  The dome comparison is painfully apposite - right down to the collateral argument that the real object of the Olympic exercise is to redevelop neglected parts of London. And, if the government does bid for the 2012 Olympics, the progress of that second attempt to demonstrate its natural exuberance is likely to be no more successful than the first. Costs will escalate when it is too late to pull out. Private backers will lose their nerve, so the Treasury will have to choose between subsidy and national humiliation. An idea that was conceived as proof that Britain is a ""can do"" society will turn into the opportunity for critics to attack a ""can't do"" government.  While pondering the objective merits of an Olympic bid, the government thought it right to consult not one but three focus groups. All of them were unanimous in the belief that the government should go ahead, but none of them was sure why. Focus groups are ""snapshots"" - glimpses of a moment which do not even claim to remain accurate pictures when it passes.  Nor do they aspire to present their participants with complicated questions such as, ""Do you find something pathetic about a nation feeling that it has to demonstrate its vitality?"" But the answer to that question must be ""yes"". It is countries in decline - see Edward Gibbon - that invent proof of their youth and vigour. Mature democracies get on with the everyday business of being peaceful, progressive and prosperous. Britain should have enough self-confidence to do the same."
6,"Should Sven go? And Chief Constable Westwood, for that matter? Not to mention Ian McCartney, Blair, Blunkett, Posh, Becks - and anyone else whose span in the headlines seems to have outstayed its welcome? This is post-failure time, scapegoat time, the morning after of the long knives: time to go out and make a meaningless sacrifice.Our illusion, most of the while, is that dumping the boss equals dramatic action. Are M&amp;S or Sainsbury's under the cosh? Then bang goes yesterday's whizz kid and everything's all right (or, more probably, not). But the sack, accompanied by sackloads of fivers, isn't the difficult option; it's an easy, often vacuous stop gap, a lever pulled for the sake of appearances. Farewell Piers Morgan, but does anyone think the Mirror's fortunes stand one jot transformed?Occasionally, to be sure, personnel shuffling grows inescapable. Kevin Keegan, and Glenn Hoddle after him, were tadpoles from a shallow, stagnant pool of talent who were never going to make fine frogs, and Sven at that moment of despond was a necessary recourse. He qualified for the big ones twice over and, left in place, he'll probably do it again. But that's not really the crux. The drums beat for him now from habit, impatience, boredom. Forget all the lousy passing, weary legs and absence of a class keeper. (Oh my Swift, Banks, Clemence and Shilton long ago!) Give us somebody else - anybody else - to get the juices flowing again.The impulse, on calmer examination, is exactly the reverse of what we say we want: that is, good management. Good managers know that mostly you have to build from the ground up, recruit solid people, construct a team and an ethos. Good managers know that most quick fixes fall apart just as quickly and that, in all probability, leaving the best man of his generation - Bobby Robson - in charge for 30 prudent years at a stretch would have brought England far more success than all the frenetic switchings. True business builders - like Stanley Kalms at Dixons or the good family Sieff at the old Marks - need the space to think and grow. True leaders aren't packed off if it begins to rain.But then, who cares about basic management theory when the headlines grow too lowering? We're in Chelsea land, Abramovich land, toyshop land, the land of the stinking rich where minds change as easily as fawning acolytes.What's the new wonder ingredient that, uncoincidentally, our government and loyal opposition both suddenly espouse? It's a return to grass roots and local option, an empowering of the consumer-citizen in his or her community, it's choice and connections. Get the suits of Whitehall out of the way. Boot the central bureaucrats. Let doctors and nurses and teachers, just doing their thing, save the day.That's one theory of course; actually the theory that ruled public life through the centuries before there was a national health service or anything you could call a national educational system. But it also shreds now at the first hard challenge.What is the democratic point of local police authorities if their views - close-up, informed, on the ground, community-based - doesn't count at a crunch? Why should David Blunkett know best and, if he does, why do his Health and Education mates sing from an utterly different hymn book? I've read the Bichard report and, if I were some omnipotent home secretary, might well want to hang David Westwood's scalp on my belt pour encourager dozy police forces everywhere. But that's not the point. The point is that the whole tide of government theory is flowing in an exactly contrary direction.""Oh, but there are children's lives at stake here,"" say his supporters. And in the schools and hospitals too, sunshine: you can't pick and choose. Kicking out Westwood won't solve the real story floating at the back of all this - the chronic under-investment in police computer systems and the even more chronic lack of high-level staff to run the systems we have managed to install. (Simply, police-pay rigidities mean that they can't pay the market rate for the skills they most need).Kicking out Westwood, jawboning and litigating over the heads of those who know him best, is just another desultory blow to local democracy, local autonomy, local living. If this particular chief constable has learned all the lessons and is as determined as he claims to put things right, then give him that high-profile chance.Which brings us straight back, of course, to one team facing relegation from the premier league: New Labour, supposedly plotting its last reshuffle of the second term. Whose card is marked for the chop? Why, small, round, squeaky Ian McCartney. Somebody has to pay for June's election debacle, and it's the party chairman.But sooner or later you have to hoot with derision. Was Mr McCartney any less small, round and television-unfriendly when the prime minister solemnly appointed him 14 months ago? Does anyone truly suppose that the Euro-vote was a vote against squeaky Scotsmen? The difficult truth, when you look at it, is that this government of supposed competence and managerial talent has shuffled more twitchily, mindlessly and redundantly than most. It has sacked first and thought later. It has set a lousy, churning, aimless example. And mangling McCartney would put the lid on all that.Does Tony Blair ever wonder why the one pillar of the team which hasn't changed - Gordie next door - is also the most successful? Because of time and experience and long-term toil. Because every shoot-out has its penalties, Sven."
6,"Winston Churchill, as usual, gave the policy a floridly eloquent gloss. Britain, he said, almost 50 years ago to the day, must reach that happy condition ""where safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin brother of annihilation"". He was talking about mutually assured destruction, or MAD - the theory of nuclear deterrence that dominated the second half of the 20th century and, uncountable billions of dollars later, kept us supposedly safe from obliteration. If our enemy had a bomb and we had a bomb, then neither of us could use it on the other because we'd both be dead in an instant.  And, at least in a negative way, that seemed to work, because the only bombs anyone dropped - on Hiroshima and Nagasaki - were Uncle Sam's message to non-nuclear Japan. MAD was salvation. MAD was security. MAD was the way of life most of us grew up with, the prevailing logic of uneasy peace. So whatever became of our mad, mad world?  It isn't that such deterrence is a busted flush. It allegedly brings realism to Indo-Pakistan relations and keeps Russia and China sweet. Many more billions of dollars have been spent on refining it since Ronald Reagan dreamed his ""evil empire"" dreams and decided that his own version of Star Wars could shrug away the chance of a sneak attack. But now a strange silence reigns.  Read George Bush's state of the union address from beginning to end and none of the grand old tunes are there; indeed, just the reverse. We had ""outposts of tyranny"" - and Iran ""as the world's primary state sponsor of terror"". We had that Condoleezza riff on the globe's ""most loathed regime"". We heard, yet again, that ""Tehran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons"". We heard nothing about our leaders' ancestral faith in mutual assurance. It is surely worth wondering why.  The theory, after all, was never disproved. It appeared, in a flurry of spending, to dispose of the evil empire. It worked between dictatorships and democracies, between Khrushchev and Kennedy. It seemingly works for Islamabad. Why, then, so much sound and fury over Iran, so many threats set aside for the ""time being"" only? Would a Tehran sandwiched between nuclear Pakistan and nuclear Israel, with nuclear Russia to the north and nuclear America everywhere in the skies above, really pose quite the menace Bush pretends?  Of course, it's cheery when countries which could make a bomb renounce that opportunity. Fewer bombs clearly means less risk of accident (or illicit trafficking). Yet sometimes the hysteria involved in prospective proliferation becomes absurd. A bomb of your own can be hugely popular on the streets, as Pakistan and India demonstrate. But it doesn't change anything very substantive. The subcontinent has fought itself into a cul de sac anyway.  No, the prevailing theory of nuclear deterrence today is far different. It sits snugly alongside George W's lectures on democracy rampant. It says that the only real superpower alone can be trusted to upgrade and hone its nuclear arsenal; that true safety means leaving everything to the White House.  But why on earth should such arguments run in countries like Iran, which have no   reason to hail American hegemony? Iran has nuclear enemies all around, as we've seen. Iran may well hunger after the respect now accorded to Pakistan. In theory - old theory - a Tehran bomb would only complete the regional balancing act. In theory - old theory - it would have stopped Saddam launching his hideous war. What's so worrying here?  There's an answer to that, naturally; a Tom Clancy-style spiel featuring terror groups, greedy scientists, berserk mullahs and the rest (basically cold war porridge re-heated for a new audience). Yet, in truth, it's a thin little theme. Is civil nuclear power fading from use? To the contrary, nuclear power is a continuing fact of 21st-century life that many poorer nations in search of development feel obliged to fund and acknowledge.  In sum, the current international block on nuclear proliferation isn't going to endure. It didn't stop Islamabad or Delhi. It won't, over time, stop central Asian republics from growing uneasy in their nuclear isolation, ringed by bomb-toting countries - or Damascus and Tehran from feeling permanently threatened by Israel's bomb.  The critical difficulty, of course, is perspective. If you even write about Israel's bomb in public, you're deluged with emails saying it can never be given up. Never? Not even in the tranquil Middle East of Condoleezza Rice's present imaginings? No, never. It is the final seal on Israel's security. Why don't you Brits give up your bomb first, those Israelis ask angrily.   And there's the rub. We could do exactly that. Like Germany, Japan, Australia, South Africa, we could walk away. But no British government has the guts. We like to be part of this club of safety's sturdy children. It gives us a certain muzzy status.  We don't want to lose our costly comfort blanket in an uncertain world. But nor do we want to ponder the future of the blanket industry. Thinking about such things makes us oddly uneasy. Better to go through imbecile motions - threatening Iran's Shias, say, just as Iraq's Shias sweep to power over the border - than contemplate steps to a bomb-free world. Better to demonise Islam further by shivering over an Islamic bomb.  In a sense, it's almost reassuring to see Moscow and Washington falling out again this morning: twin brothers of annihilation able to snarl but not think afresh, glad to be mad in their crazy cocoon."
6,"I suppose you could say that my current inquiries (into the state of European healthcare) went rather deeper than anything managed by Dr Liam Fox or Alan Milburn. I didn't just go and look at hospitals. I became the involuntary English patient.  Too easily done. A dark night in a pretty deserted Catalan village. A trip and a heavy fall, cannoning sideways into a giant flower pot. When I got back to home base, the ribs were shrieking and I was bleeding internally. Kidney damage? Not - even by my battered lights - a good scene.   The ambulance came - from the local town, six miles away - in 15 minutes. On to that town's little all-night clinic, then, at the double, to the hospital in Palamos (population 15,000). Ninety-two minutes after the fall I'd been x-rayed, assessed, put on a drip and given a bed in the emergency ward, blood pressure monitored on the hour. By eight in the morning, I'd had an ultrasound scan of the kidneys.   ""Normal"" said the scanner lugubriously. ""Normal."" But the bleeding hadn't stopped. Getting better - on solemn doctor's orders - involved four more days and nights lying immobile in a bed upstairs. Plenty of time to think and observe, as well as ache.   What was different about this place? How was it different from, say, the south London hospital of rather grim repute where my mother-in-law once took her 89-year-old broken hip? Here are a few of the different things - some physical, some social, some organisational.   Physically, there weren't any wards in the old British manner - and certainly not the mixed-sex agglomeration my mother-in-law found so humiliating. Palamos gives you a large room to share (suitably curtained) between two, a phone at your right hand, a light switch and buzzer at your left. The room comes with a loo, shower and basin and coin-in-the-slot TV. In no sense lush; indeed, rather bare. But fresh and clean. The first person in each morning, before it was light, was the cleaner.   Socially, you might as well have been on another planet. There are no defined visiting hours. My wife slept with me the first night upstairs on an aeroplane-type chair by the bed. Standard practice in Spain: all relatives welcome. My roomshare beyond the curtain had an operation at six one evening, was wheeled back from theatre at 9.30 and seemed then to stage a bustle of comings and goings till 25 minutes to midnight. You don't feel - from the noise - as though you're in hospital. It's more like a good party where the drinks have run out. Revitalisation? Si. Recuperation? Maybe.   Organisationally, they believe in clockwork. You could set your watch by the appearance of meals, temperature takers, linen changers (new linen every day at 10.30), bed bathers. Everybody - except one glum night nurse - smiled. I made the average bell response time 51 seconds. No demarcation lines. Nurses or radiographers turn porters in an instant if that's sensible. No queueing. On discharge morning, they fetched me for a second x-ray and scan exactly when they'd said they would. The doctor arrived on cue. I was checked and on my way out in three meticulous hours. Efficiency - even in the middle of a Catalan flu epidemic - lives. As you arrive, they give you a report card to tick on the way out about your treatment.   Now, I've no way of knowing whether Palamos hospital - founded 1761 - is in any way exceptional. The boys in my village bar say it's fine, better than Girona. ""Though you should try France. That's perfecto."" And, of course, there are surely many better hospitals around than the decrepit, rigidly dour place my mother-in-law encountered a few days before she died.   Even so, Palamos came up trumps. It was cheery, carefully organised and care-filled. I'd have done brilliantly to have found its like in Britain at the first time of asking (and I might have found the Portland). Now for the nitty-gritty.   Five nights, drips, drugs, ambulances, food and two complete sets of tests cost £980 on travel insurance - because I hadn't got an EU form E111 with me. That, stacked against £300 for an annual 45 minutes of Harley Street check-up, is amazing value. It also points to the door where Messrs Fox and Milburn might like to knock.   The way Spain finances its health (at around the European average that Mr Blair would aspire to immediately, if only his defence spending wasn't far above the European average) is calculated to invite a British frown. The state, via taxation, buys you what Ally Campbell would probably call bog standard care. In time of emergency need, nobody worries. (I'd have been treated the same in Palamos whatever scheme or non-scheme operated). But that isn't the whole of the story. Beyond the bog standard, there's also private insurance and super private insurance.   We don't need to worry about the super club. That's just big bucks as usual. But the modest insurance route (a mix and match with state provision) is much more interesting. For one thing, it's relatively cheap. My daughter pays just under £1 a day - a cup of coffee - for coverage which allows her access to a chosen doctor, chosen hospitals to give birth in, and stay for four days, annual dental checks - the lot. For another thing, millions of people - a huge majority - take out the policy. It is the norm, not the exception.   It echoes a mix of means and methods (where the state sometimes finances private hospitals). It sanctions choice and convenience. It separates the good from the slack, because quality follows the funds flow. Being a customer matters. It buys the equipment. It puts extra cash directly into the central system.   Is that what Nye Bevin would hail as his dream made flesh? Perhaps not. Egalitarianism gags at the public/private divide. So, in British terms, does the political necessity of paying something extra for a supposedly ""free"" service. New Labour has seen this future - and dived for cover. Iain Duncan Smith will probably do likewise for all his Swedish foreplay.   ""But why shouldn't people who can afford to pay be asked to pay something?"" inquires a Spanish doctor. It is what makes their health service viable - for the price of a grotty package holiday. It can, as a matter of priority, be afforded. It's pitched low because it needs to keep costs down for the many - not set them high for exclusiveness. It trains the extra doctors and nurses Mr Milburn would like to recruit. And all for the price of a cup of coffee.   There's the principle (paradise lost) and the practicality. And the question - as the bleeding man said when he cannoned into an amphora - is what's so wrong, if those who were ill get better?"
6,"This injunction couldn't be clearer. ""The United States will not be able to achieve its goals in the Middle East unless it deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict. There must be a renewed and sustained commitment by the United States to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts."" Notice that ""must"" word. Jim Baker and friends shout it now, in terms. Tony Blair says it again and again. If you don't cut out the cancer of hatred, loss and retribution, then nothing good will happen. There will be no rest for Iraq, no spread of democracy, no rapprochement with Tehran - and no breakthrough in the campaign against terrorism (including, Mr Blair might add, the wild and woolly recruitment of suicide teenagers from Leeds to Lahore).Dig deeper in the Baker report text to discover what such ""commitment"" involves. ""For several reasons, we should act boldly: there is no military solution to this conflict. The vast majority of the Israeli body politic is tired of being a nation perpetually at war. No American administration - Democratic or Republican - will ever abandon Israel. Political engagement and dialogue are essential in the Arab-Israeli dispute because it is an axiom that when the political process breaks down there will be violence on the ground.""Thus the road map is rolled out again. Thus UN resolutions 242 and 338 - which mean handing back the territorial spoils of past war - are invoked as foundation documents. Thus hostile nations and organisations that deny Israel's right to exist are frozen out of any action, and a more malleable Syria gets the Golan Heights back (maybe with US troops deployed along its new border). Thus two viable states emerge and learn to live together.It doesn't sound an easy road - and, of course, it isn't. But there is at least a vestigial pathway here, if anyone wishes to walk along it. Yet who, first out of the block, seems to hate talking the talk, let alone putting his hiking boots on? Yes: it's the ally no American administration will ever abandon. In short order, Ehud Olmert announces that this ""attempt to create a linkage between the Iraqi issue and the Mideast issue"" is wrong. ""We have a different view."" More, he claims, George Bush has always agreed with him. Meet with Iran? Actually, he doesn't rule out military strikes against Tehran and its ""criminal"" president. ""I rule nothing out."" And as for Syria, Germany's foreign minister takes a pasting for even going to Damascus. ""I think he made a mistake.""Maybe, with Hamas sidelined, Mr Olmert would see about seeking a ""contiguous zone"" agreement with President Mahmoud Abbas. But fiercely, specifically, he won't let the rest of the region in. It's nothing to do with them. Except, of course, that that's rubbish.The trouble with Tehran - apart from some fire-breathing presidential rhetoric - is Iran's possible bomb, 10 years away in the making. Who else in the region has such a bomb already? Israel. Whose rockets landed on Israeli territory? Iraq's. Who reputedly plays godfather to Hizbullah in Lebanon? Iran. Who competes relentlessly for influence in Beirut? Syria. The list is longer than that, of course, but the point is a short, sharp one: there is no halcyon world where dominant Israelis and compliant Palestinians can be left alone to work out a deal. Everything connects - in emotion and often in practice. And Olmert fears that, which is why he moves so swiftly to exclude Iran and Syria; for including them brings pressure to his door.Be clear. This is, absolutely, the reverse of the Baker plan. This turndown from day one. This is the abandonment of whatever wisdom the independent study group has to offer. Who needs enemies to sabotage prospects of a wider peace when ""friends"" do it instinctively? Don't they fear at least some retribution from US public opinion? Alas, no. As Jimmy Carter wrote the other day: ""It would be almost politically suicidal for members of Congress to espouse a balanced position between Israel and Palestine ... Very few of them would ever deign to visit the cities of Ramallah, Nablus, Hebron, Gaza City or Bethlehem and talk to the beleaguered residents.""Accept that American attachment to the Israeli cause is total - as Baker himself makes clear. Bring on more peacekeeping American troops. The hinge and the question, though, is how far that attachment should wreck everything else? Israel could be propelled into regional talks. It floats on a sea of US subsidy. It is, in many ways , the real 51st state. But it does not agree with Baker that there are ""no military solutions"" here. Nor will it commit to the necessary level of ""political engagement"". Does more ""violence on the ground"" follow automatically, then? It's a sad, sad way to ""abandon"" hope. <br>"
6,"Boris Tadic is a handsome, charismatic and rather courageous politician. If he belonged to the Labour party, cabinet ""loyalists"" would be queueing at his door, asking him to knife Mr B in the back. But Tadic already has a job. He is president of Serbia. It is he, and his young, reforming appointees, who tracked down Radovan Karadzic. It is he - the hymn from London, Paris, Berlin, Washington et al last week - who ""chose Europe"" (not a nationalistic, neo-fascist, sub-communist swamp, with only Moscow for a chum). Which is great: except, will Europe choose him? Everyone loves a horror story, so the capture of Karadzic, the pursuit of Mladic and the stomach-turning bestiality of Srebrenica can soon be turned into big headlines again. Thus are our continent's foulest days since 1945 remembered. Oh good! There's a happy ending. But Serbia has no end in sight yet, no hope of swift closure. For what are our leaders saying once they've rejoiced, hailed western values and - in some tortuous way - claimed victory for their beliefs? They're mumbling.  Let's say out loud, then, what every chancellery in Europe whispers behind its hands. The European Union project is not complete until membership in the western Balkans is complete. Croatia, virtually every hurdle vaulted, stands on the brink of membership. It has done 95% of the negotiation. It will be ready next year. And now Serbia, at last, may follow on behind. Montenegro, Macedonia, Kosovo and an increasingly fraught Bosnia are waiting in the same line. So, usually unmentioned, is Albania.  None of this is outlandish stuff, nor as vexed and tangled as the Turkish question. On the contrary, it is commonplace in our own Foreign Office. But why the hold-up, why the mumbles and delays? Because, months ago, Croatia got a red light from Brussels. Nothing further could happen until the reforms of the Lisbon treaty were approved all round. Simply grafting another member on to the existing 27 wasn't administratively sensible. And, because this was a process of logic and diplomacy, nobody was really talking one extra anyway. They were talking seven more, a union of 34. That - plus Turkey as an increasingly outside bet - will be it for Europe: the practical definition of boundaries and interests formed as we've gone along. After Milosevic and Karadzic, no one who's remotely serious about war, peace or progress believes the Balkans can just be left dangling in a pit of constant evasion. It was Tadic who, with rare drive, just managed to defeat the old forces of isolation (and Russian influence) at the last election. It was Tadic who kept Europe's frail Kosovo policy - European troops holding the peace on European soil - from collapsing. But Tadic knows, all too clearly, that he is a means to an end, not an end in himself. Serbia, the biggest and most historically maverick nation in the Balkans, must have a European future, or it will have nothing but trouble. And that's where the snares, delusions and dislocations begin. Was Belgrade even mentioned when Dublin voted? Of course not: nobody likes stretching voters so far. Does David Cameron make any Serbian connections when he talks about Britain's own referendum, when and if? Of course not, unless there's a Serbian restaurant in Notting Hill. And Glasgow East, inevitably, is a million miles from Balkans West.  Nevertheless, the connections are there. Among the thousands whom Karadzic helped slaughter. Among the rubble of the offices in Belgrade left untouched since Nato jets destroyed them. Emotionally, even, in the posters that plaster Belgrade hoardings. Paul Anka was here: Rihanna will be here. Summer means pop concerts and young people fresh from the Wogan memorial song contest. This isn't some forgotten spot on the map. This is part of Europe deciding instinctively that it wants to be part of Europe, that Europe is its salvation after too many nightmares. This, when Tadic speaks, is the ""vision"" thing we all supposedly crave. What happens next? Serbia, like Bosnia and the rest, moved into the official ""waiting room"" last year. It has hope bureaucratically locked in (and endorsed by 27 governments). But will there be momentum to match expectation? In particular, will the reasons for enlargement begin to register in the lands where only straight bananas and bent prejudices grow? When I heard Tadic speak a few weeks ago - openly, directly - I found a man who was staking his life and his country on an honest answer to the question that defines him and, in its repercussions, could define us, too. And he didn't mumble."
6,"It is probably the most visceral question of our times, asked from Chechnya to Kashmir to Armagh and often answered in blood. But the odd thing is that, no matter how many times he hears it, no matter how many times he witnesses its consequences, Tony Blair never quite gets the point. Indeed, he, John Prescott and Robin Cook still troop around blank-faced, offering the question up on a plate. As though it were panacea, not potential poison. What do the Chechens, with their bombs and their kidnappers, want? They want to live in a free little country of their own - not as a runt in the litter of Russia's federation. What do the Kashmiris, with their bombs and murderous attacks, want? They want to be free of the Indian federation (and possibly of Pakistani ambition, too). And the Kurds, the Tamils, the Corsicans and Kosovans? Wherever you look, wherever you go, there are minorities buried within bigger countries demanding autonomy. But the bigger countries - thank you President Putin - are saying: ""No."" Not maybe; not perhaps, one fine day; just no. Their no is the voice of the majority. Minorities have rights. Majorities have the last word.  But in Britain, though we seldom pause to reflect on it, there is another way that gives minorities the last word - and majorities not so much as a word in edgeways. Do Scotland or Wales wish to elect their own parliaments? All they have to do is win a referendum first. The done devolution deal.  Does Northern Ireland wish to remain a part of the UK, or join with Dublin? A referendum for Northern Irish voters lies constantly open. All republicans have to do to leave is win, and then push off. And - whisper it gently - the same formula lies there for the Scots and the Welsh one day. It seems so obvious, so normal. Mr Cook at the weekend was peddling regional assemblies for anyone who calls. Mr Prescott sells elected mayors like cans of beans.  But in fact this seeming normality is rather remarkable; and perhaps remarkable folly. Tony Blair's biggest mate in Europe, Jose Maria Aznar, would certainly think so. Other democratic countries' byzantine struggles against their own minorities tend not to make newspaper headlines here. They are complex, introverted tales. Spain follows events in Northern Ireland closely, because it hears eerie echoes - but London doesn't linger long over the tumult in Bilbao or Barcelona. Nevertheless, there is reason to linger.  Britain long ago offered Gibraltar a referendum to ratify or reject a change in its status should London and Madrid ever seek to negotiate one. Because Aznar and Blair are pals, those negotiations have taken place. Because sovereignty can be shared, that is the preferred solution. But 30,000 Gibraltarians want nothing to do with it. They have their referendum - and other Iberians have suddenly taken up the same cry.  We'll hold our own vote in a couple of years, says Juan Jose Ibarretxe, president of the Basque country's ruling PNV. Give us a loose association with Madrid plus a place in the European Union and there's a peaceful way out for everyone. Hey, and if they're doing that, says Arturo Mas, the new leader of Catalonia's nationalists, we'll want a better deal, too. What's sauce for Gibraltar's goose is suddenly the sauce of separatism across much of northern Spain.  It is a thick stew of politics, with some parallels - the banning of Batasuna, the Basques' Sinn Fein; the goal of ""freedom"" within the EU - and some important differences, including a tradition of terror attacks to make the IRA seem wimps. But the most important difference of the lot is Madrid's stubborn antipathy to capitulation. Why should a minority be able to decide the fate of a nation without reference to the majority that surrounds and supports it? Where is the fairness or democracy in that?  There's the vexatious question. Majorities have rights, too. They want their country kept whole, for fear of wholesale disintegration. So they need a specific voice in deciding its future, just as Aznar demands a voice that represents the interests of all Spaniards, not just Spain's richest, most disaffected regions.  But this is curiously not the current British instinct. Want to bale out of a disunited kingdom? Sure: carry on. Want a block on progress to any solution? Sure: the Gibraltarians have it, whatever the wider British interest. Want a fatter range of subsidies from the centre as your price for staying on board? Sure: that is the precise Prescott-Cook formula for introducing more regional assemblies. If the north-east (say) fancies some of the same boodle as Scotland and Wales, then it need only vote to get it. From Middlesbrough to Hartlepool you can even get your oddball elected mayor if you tick the right box. Yet the people who pay for that decision, who have to live with this jigsaw system, are never asked the question square on. We don't get a national referendum to sanctify the process; we are pushed aside.  Stand back and ponder the illogic here. Northern Ireland lapses bad-temperedly into direct rule again. But the direct rulers - us - have damn-all say in what happens next. We merely hold the punchbag. A Gibraltar settlement? No dice. A decent accounting of devolution? No way. A local government framework that offers coherence? Sadly not. More elected mayors to re-charge voting turn-outs? Alas, look at Switzerland, with its constant compartmentalisation and referendums. And don't bother to guess which European country has the lowest voting levels of the lot.  What sounds so reasonable can be a recipe for stagnation and fissiparous impotence. A switch-off, not a turn-on. The question is itself a stinker because we gave away the answer long ago."
6,"The curse of the nanny is almost routine these days. No White House team can dodge it as the vengeful virus spreads. Exit one director of homeland security designate in the time it takes to change a diaper - or fast track a visa through the Home Office. (If Osama were really as bright as people say, he'd be training squads of suicide nannies even now.) But do not, perhaps, follow the spin here too swiftly. Pause over the disaster of Bernie Kerik before hurrying on.Kerik, unlike most other nannygate victims, isn't some busy lady lawyer juggling private practice and a family in distracted desperation. Long ago, he was Rudy Giuliani's driver, the chauffeur who became chief of Rudy's NYPD, the capo di tutti copos in charge for 9/11, the mate the ex-mayor recommended when he turned down the homeland job himself. Law enforcement and detection are his professional business, illegal immigration and proper payment of taxes his natural concerns.But he wasn't a natural choice - in experience or diplomacy - to run a great umbrella department of state. There were other confirmation issues for him, too: a $6.2m stock option killing on stun guns, for instance, or the jokes about Caligula's police horse. The Senate hearings were always going to be tough, even before he ""discovered"" a hole in nanny's paperwork. And there's the crucial, overarching point.Kerik was a flawed candidate from the beginning, selected sloppily from a lacklustre field. As he departs, the Oval Office sucks its collective thumb. Though Tom Ridge, the incumbent director, announced long before the election that he'd be quitting (he wasn't making enough money to keep his family in the manner accustomed), the search for a successor has been a continuing botch. Which, in turn, sends an early, dissonant message about Bush's second term.Only six weeks after his victory, the vibrations continue euphoric going on triumphalist. Depressed Democrats wonder if they could ever win again. Pundits ponder theses about eternal Republican hegemony. Talk is of more Bush power, more neoconservative solutions, more variations on a narrow and occasionally alarming agenda. But is that quite what unfolding events tell us?The White House - as recommended by the 9/11 commission - got its director of national intelligence last week, who'll supervise a $40bn annual budget and sit atop the CIA, FBI and assorted agencies. It didn't, however, get these plans through Congress without a grinding argument, with Republicans leading the charge. And it hasn't got a star candidate for that top job either.  For all the hot air rising, the great umbrellas of civil defence and proactive intelligence are still folded, while around Mr Bush's cabinet table talented operators like Colin Powell, and many less formidable figures, depart. That's natural, perhaps. They're tired or bored or anxious to write a book. But the interesting thing is who survives: not just Donald Rumsfeld, but notably underpowered performers like the treasury secretary, John Snow. No one, it seems, is very keen on joining this supposedly refreshed administration. No one (least of all Rudy Giuliani) sees their future there.That's no surprise when you think about it, though. For there is no future that Bush can offer beyond four more declining years. Senator Joe Biden is already signalling he'll be a Democratic contender in 2008; Hillary Clinton openly ponders her options; likely governors clear their diaries and form little campaign teams. This race never stops, this race is never won. And George Bush has voluntarily relinquished his right to a say on its course.He let (or perhaps was powerless to resist) Dick Cheney be his running mate again. Cheney is not a possible candidate in 2008. He is thus the only vice-president serving a second (fixed) term president whose career automatically stops when the boss stops. Nixon ran to succeed Eisenhower, Bush senior to succeed Reagan, Gore to succeed Clinton. While there was that prospect of continuity there was also some hope of continuing Washington employment. But, four years hence, all the old Bush boys get their cards.That matters hugely. It matters if you're James Sensenbrenner, the Republican chairman of the House judiciary committee, who caused Bush so much grief over his national intelligence director - and vows to cause much more. What has he to lose? He'll be there when George W is back at the ranch forever. It matters if you're a Republican hopeful or might-be in some governor's mansion from Sacramento to Albany. You can't keep quiet about things that go wrong; you have to be your own critical man. It matters because obvious recruits like Rudy send their horse instead.Fixed terms (as Tony Blair may soon discover) carry their own curse in diminished clout. Doubly fixed terms of the Bush-Cheney variety grow debilitated even faster. Look at the highlights so far. Condoleezza Rice goes to State, but leaves only a number two behind to advise the president. Snow lingers to sweet talk the budget deficit; Rumsfeld, 72, stays to sort out his own mess; Porter Goss, already three years beyond the new Whitehall retiring age, takes over the CIA; Bernie Kerik goes back to the ironing board. Terrorism may have helped win an election, but it's all low priority now.None of this makes the next four years a kinder, gentler time; least of all a more competent one. But it isn't the irresistible force of instant legend; it isn't a masterful George and obedient servants. It is Donald and Dick and Johnny and Condi (just like Tony and Gordon and David). It is a curse beyond nanny, the curse of exhaustion and ambition and greed and hard calculation."
6,"What happened when HRH met Tony Blair and the MMR question? They debated life (and death) in the goldfish bowl, that's what. And it's right - as every last tale about Princess Margaret fills those parts of the prints not subsumed by the sum of all fears about measles - that we should join in, too. The core of the matter is kids growing up in the spotlight. Where do their rights begin and end? Our prime minister holds baby Leo's privacy dear (as he and Cherie do for all their children). But is such concern, such passionate concern, rooted in the invasion of the moment, the instant wince over this photograph or that headline? Or is it much deeper, a fear about outcomes? Does it betray a belief that press pressure today equals trouble 10 or 20 years down the road? That privacy, if you will, is a kind of normality inoculation.  There's no science to this, nothing the chief medical officer could base a campaign around. Still: 65 years ago, two little girls were growing up in Buckingham Palace. They were (just about) the most famous, most pressured little girls in the world.  One, the elder, was earnest and dutiful and a touch uncommunicative. She was in training to take the strain; to marry a suitable man, bear suitable children and provide suitably sensible leadership to her nation. Her sister, by contrast, was the pretty - and pretty wild - one. She didn't feel so much of the heat, because she was second in line and then nowhere in line. The pressure was less. Yet the lid of the pressure cooker kept blowing off.  She partied and boozed and stayed out at nights. She almost married an upright chap, and then thought better of it. She actually married a society snapper, but they both thought better of it. And so she ploughed on through more affairs, more empty bottles, more tropical nights - until the chief medical officer's warning on the packet caught up with her.  But outcomes? The earnest, dutiful, sensible girl had four children (with three divorces so far and innumerable lurid problems). The wild, mixed-up, generally deplorable girl had two children to share her bit of the goldfish bowl: they have always seemed, and still seem, refreshingly normal, grounded, industrious. There was no cause and effect.  It's worth making such parallels and drawing such lessons, however frail, because these connections clearly exist in the Blairs' minds. When the PM lamented the dead Diana, he struck a chord in himself as well as elsewhere. When he rowed in, immediately, gratuitously, to congratulate Prince Charles on his handling of Harry (and the News of the World) he made an implicit comparison.  We - that's Charlie and Cherie and Camilla and me - know how difficult it is when teenagers fall off the track. We're united in mutual sympathy, understanding, and closeness to the press complaints commission. We can phone Lord Wakeham (or whoever happens to have not stepped aside) day and night. And, by golly, we do; not to mention tame lawyers bearing injunctions. We walloped Ros Mark with the might of the law, just like HM walloped Crawfie. We know what it is to be (sort of) royal.  Now, a quick disclaimer. I remain a considerable admirer of Mr Blair, of his eloquence and energy. When Sierra Leone cheers, it behoves us to listen. And, on last week's gabby form, I'd drop Lord Haskins in the deep end and leave him there. Our prime minister still makes most of his western oppos look lumpen. So this privacy point is not, Daily-Mail-like, twisted into some broader thesis about moral rot: it seeks merely to stand alone.  If you talk about Leo through the ranks of government, you'll find a lot of support for the Blairs' line in the sand. Ministers have children, too. They are instinctively protective of them. If Tony and Cherie want to make a big thing of it, they're entitled. They have the ""right"". (Anyone, including press men, can relate to that.)  But what becomes of this right when other rights - other public rights - are thrown into the pot? The same ministers who defend Leo's right to second-remove silence do not, equally, doubt that the Mail's MMR bandwagon would never have rolled so fast or so disastrously if the Blairs, from day one, had said: ""Sure, we know what's safe and best and necessary - and our kid's getting (or had) the triple jab"".  There would have been no contorted denials or blustery defences; there would have been no ""hints"" or ""ever stronger hints""; there would have been no subsidiary ministers, like poor Jacqui Smith, hung out to dry on Today; there would have no repeated evasion for the Mail or Sun to peg a campaign on. The prime minister would have simply told the simple truth. Leo is an MMR baby. Don't do as I say, do as I do.  In one sense, the Blairs' reticence is admirable. Better that than George Bush's hawking around private family grief over Enron (his mother-in-law lost $8,000, in case you missed it) as though random victimhood excuses all. But there is also a lack of foresight and proportion.  We can say, with fair accuracy, how many children will die over the next 10 to 15 years because they didn't get the jab. Science can do the statistics. The figures don't mean panic stations, and they certainly aren't the end of the world: but there will be deaths and there will be terrible disabilities. Treasury bean-counters, much further down the scale, can tally the price of failed advertising campaigns. Why don't we believe that doctors tell us the truth any longer? Why don't we believe politicians?  Not new questions in a world of mad cows and too many medical feet in too many mouths. GM foods have become one cross of political life. So No 10's failure, on the first day, to realise where the hints and the silences were taking it is at best sluggardly and at worst wilful. This was an avoidable disaster. It can still be mitigated - not by the spending of another £3m on ads, but by plain communication from a great communicator.  Why hasn't that long since come? Why is it still wrapped in contortions? Why is the issue itself, the privacy issue, a scab to be picked at and worried over? Because - from Amy Carter to Chelsea Clinton - the cause and the effect have never been argued through. Because trained lawyers confuse legal ""principle"" with what works in practice. Because the injunction and PCC game (as over Euan's college choice) has become an obsession which Charles wouldn't even try with Harry. And because we forget that people, anyway, forget.  Who remembers William Straw? Who remembers Peter Townsend, or Roddy Llewellyn? Leading is keeping your balance in the land time forgets."
6,"The most pulsating polls of the moment have nothing to do with the Tories closing the gap or falling further behind - according to which Sunday paper you're reading. Indeed, their findings have nothing directly to do with Britain 2005 at all. (We'll do indirectly in a moment.) These are the polls that measure a re-elected George Bush's popularity, and thus the ""dividend"" he intended to spend on ""being Bush"". Strange news: there is no dividend. And George, at this point of the second term, is the least popular president of the US since the second world war.  Let's (from Gallup's March ratings) put figures on that claim. Harry Truman in March 1949 stood at 57% approval. Dwight Eisenhower in 1957 had 65%, Lyndon Johnson in 1965 a full 69%. Richard Nixon (1973) retained 57%. In more recent times, Ronald Reagan (1985) held at 56% and Bill Clinton (1997) at 59%. Last month's Bush score was 45%. This month it has crawled up a point or two, but still runs flat bottom of the pack.  How can this possibly be? Well, issues coagulate. Only one American in three is happy about the state of the economy. Petrol prices are taking a terrible toll - and connecting with the continuing toll in Iraq. A US majority (52%) now regrets going to war. Bush's showpiece social-security plan has opened and closed like Michael Frayn's Democracy on Broadway.  But one thing seeps into another. The Terri Schiavo tragedy - born-again Republicans on Capitol Hill rushing round to tell hard-working doctors and Florida judges what to do - didn't play well. And, whether by osmosis or accident, dominant House figures like Tom DeLay, the majority leader, are coming up slimy as investigative reporters get to work. There's a sense of grim, debilitating business as usual.  Where's the momentum of last November and of a clear victory that laid doubts about 2000's narrow squeak to rest? There is no momentum, because - not so deep down - there is no future for this administration. America's newspapers, week by week now, record those big-and-small-name Republicans hiring extra aides, preparing policy positions, jetting away to eat rubber chicken in New Hampshire or Iowa. Whither Rudy Giuliani? Which way John McCain? Whatever happened to brother Jeb?  Democrats, in defeat and returning hope, can hit the trail again without raising too much dust: John Edwards and John Kerry are wending their ways separately this time, Hillary Clinton pursues ambition along a dedicated path. But Republicans don't know which way to go.  Will there be a Bush inheritance come 2008, a fat, happy slice of America that likes big government, big deficits and rightwing tub-thumping? Or will the Republicans split open wide as they ponder the micro-management of ordinary people's lives, poor Terri Schiavo's lingering legacy?  The crucial point - the point that reaches right back to Eisenhower - is that every previous modern second-term president has had his succession in order as he settled down to four more years. The vice-president was there to be anointed. The flickering flame had a designated carrier.  Only George W lacks that sense of continuity. There are occasional, slightly bizarre tales about Dick Cheney getting ready to run, but no wonder cures for a chronic heart condition to give them credibility. After Bush, for the moment, there is only a huge question mark, and a vacuum that must be filled by a party making up its mind in the open and in office, the various challengers competing dissonantly to offer something different.  Some commentators, of course, are keen on term limits. But these always limit what presidents - even with a clear successor named - can achieve during that last quarter of their time in power. Without that succession in place, as we see, the rot sets in far earlier.  It doesn't give the opposition instant clout. The Democrats are still in the doldrums. But it divides and enervates the party of government, sets it arguing and manoeuvring and concentrating on a future that may never happen. It is one damned row after another.  In short, George Bush, the alleged master of the world, has failed to get his front parlours and waiting rooms organised. And already that failure begins to drag him down. Get your succession policy wrong in a chattering world of personality-charged politics and nothing goes right. That's the fire smouldering under Bush. It is the blaze beginning to consume France as Jacques Chirac falters. It is also the fact behind the smoke of the past few days in Britain.  Tony Blair - much impressed by what his chum Jos Mara Aznar seemed to have achieved in Spain - thought he could set a limit on his own term. But Aznar had his succession in order   and his party under strict control - he still lost. Blair's only visible strategy seemed to be trying to make sure that his obvious successor got shafted somewhere along the road to 2009.  Well, we know now that this didn't work. The chorus of the polls and commentators hails the triumph of the indispensable Gordon, the humiliation of a suddenly peripheral Tony.  The debate between the pair, in the nature of things, seems to be centred on policy, on privatisations, public spending et al: but the reality is cruder and starker than that. Blair is paying for his folly of doubt last year - the debate in his own head about carrying on or not. His wobble ended when he gave himself four more years, but those years are not his to bestow.  It's a crisp conversation over cocktails when the G8 comes to London this summer. What's the giddy limit, George? Search me, prime minister: I'm the last one to know."
6,"Politics can turn exciting - as in Gordon v Tony or David v David - and newspapermen like excitement. But politics can also turn chaotic - and then those who write, just like those who read, should feel only apprehension. So to the plight of George Bush and the one man who can save his presidency.What, Bush in chaos? That seems to be overexcited, to be sure. He has three full years to run and clear majorities in both houses of Congress. He's secure, a leader beyond ousting. Maybe a certain incoherence lets him down, but his administration marches volubly on, unapologetic and seemingly unafraid.Yet look closer. Opinion polls have been getting worse since Iraq turned sour. Bush can command approval ratings of only about 35%, his lowest in five years. What goes down can always go up, you say, and did after Ronald Reagan had fallen far further; but Reagan saw big things - like goodbye to the cold war - go right; and the spirit of Gorbachev doesn't stalk downtown Baghdad.Worse, there are some perceptions that can't be swept away by strokes of good fortune. Is Bush ""honest and ethical"" ask the polls, and 68% of Americans answer no. Is he a winner or a loser when real votes have to be cast? Last week's Virginia gubernatorial defeat is pressing all manner of panic buttons.Bush, in sum, has lost his way. He needs Iraq to work out wonderfully and pretty damn quick. He needs to revolutionise verdicts on his New Orleans performance, not to mention his supreme court nomination shambles. And he needs, quite desperately, to become relevant to his own party again.You can't govern for very long, no matter how big your majority, if your party raises a bleak two fingers and crosses the street when it sees you coming. (The Anthony Lynton Blair memorial lecture on a far grander stage.) But that's exactly today's Republican affliction: no consensus on budget deficit cuts, only unhappiness and a pork barrel wheeled irresolutely around in the wings. The splits between ""moderate"" Republicans in vulnerable constituencies and rightwingers who preach without fear of retribution are opening wide.And so to the fatal flaw that has dogged this second term from day one, the simple question with no available answer: after George, who or what? If presidents don't make a stab at answering that question when they choose a vice-president - a Gore, a Papa Bush, a Mondale or even a Nixon - then their inheritance crumbles to instant dust. They have no legacy, because their political span stops vacantly short.That was the choice Bush made when he picked Dick Cheney for another term. It's the decision that, day by day, brings him down. If you haven't got a designated heir and an administration that sees the chance of continuing life in transferred allegiances, then you've only got time, running out. Cheney is not a candidate. He is too old, too sick and in too much trouble. The prosecutors who pursue his chief of staff pursue him too. The White House's lousiest moral maze wanders straight up Pennsylvania Avenue to his door.This situation upends the first-term dynamics when Cheney was the experienced professional and chum of dad who exercised more influence than any vice-president in memory. Without him, Saddam would still be in charge of Iraq, looking for his own WMD. Without him, Colin Powell would still have been the voice of American foreign policy.But now Cheney is shaky and absolutely no mover. Every time he climbs into some bully pulpit and snarls defiance, Bush's ratings slide again. The party looks out three years and sees contenders circling. Condoleezza Rice has said she'd never stand, which leaves John McCain, a favourite again at 67; Rudy Giuliani, if memories for 9/11 last; George Pataki, from Albany - and many more. The current party of government is future-obsessed. The Oval Office it holds is a pear-shaped irrelevance.Is that good news for the world's next three years? No more than that a scramble of Campaign groupers and disaffected ex-ministers can hold our parliament to ransom. Odd though it may seem to say it, Bush - in office but not power - will need to recover at least some authority. Goodbye dear Dick, your time is up. Resignation offered and accepted. Hello to a successor with 2008 traction - say Senator George Allen, from Virginia. If you can't go on in some shape or form, then you can't go anywhere. And that's not excitement: it's creeping chaos."
6,"The grisliest quote of the week, the one to cut out and keep, came when reporters asked Lea Anne McBride what her boss was doing as New Orleans sank, stank and suppurated. ""He's working from Wyoming today,"" said Vice-President Dick Cheney's official spokesman brightly. At which point - against all odds - you began to feel slightly sorry for George Bush.No one with any semblance of rationality can pretend that Bush carries personal blame for the debacle of New Orleans. He didn't personally go through the fine print of recent budgets and strike out the item marked ""Levees, strengthening of"". He didn't personally choose the federal emergency mastermind for such crises (a former selector of horse-show judges). As a notoriously light reader, he clearly never clapped eyes on commodious newspaper and official warnings of hurricane wrath to come.The president was on holiday, as usual, when Katrina roared in from the Gulf of Mexico last Monday. Perhaps he took the first TV reports - that New Orleans had missed the worst - as gospel, and went for a jog. Perhaps his staff didn't want to wake him. The mythology of ""commander-in-chief"" and the reality were starkly separated again. It's foolish to dump everything (including the historic woes and racial divisions of a city born to sing the blues) on poor George alone.Leaders of great nations facing great trouble depend on the team and the professionalism around them. Tony Blair didn't jet back from his winter break by the Red Sea when the tsunami struck. He left John Prescott to handle the meetings and Whitehall's machine to handle the detail.He knows that, apart from a few ceremonial appearances in 7/7 mode, it doesn't matter whether he's there or not when true disaster strikes. You can't invent a functioning bureaucracy overnight. You can't hand-deliver tonnes of bottled water to the thirsty yourself. The thing is either organised, long since organised - or it's not. So back to Wyoming.Nobody, in the late 90s when the Republican party searched for a standard-bearer, turned to Bush for his magnificent managerial skills. He'd part-owned a baseball team and part-superintended a small, struggling oil company, but his only relevant job had been governor of Texas. He was chosen as folksy symbol, heir to a dynasty, born-again communicator: and he fitted that bill well enough.But fine detail and hard grind? No way. This was where Cheney came in: a vice-president apart, deeply experienced runner of defence departments, congressional offices and giant corporations. He'd handle the tough stuff while George did front of house. The rarely posed question in the fifth year of this administration is: whatever happened to that neat division of labour?You can, to be sure, trace many of Team Bush's woes - especially the decision to take on Saddam - to an ideology that couldn't stand practical scrutiny. You can certainly trace much of the antipathy towards the president, domestic and international, to his policies and the way he presents them. But the dreadful lesson of New Orleans has very little to do with rhetorical postures. It is the problem of delivery that keeps letting America down.Look at the prelude to 9/11 - where ever more damning details of bureaucratic blindness and non-cooperation still surface - and the failure to head off al-Qaida's amateurish attacks was a shambles. Look at the intelligence tangle before Iraq - and the massive post-invasion decisions (like disbanding the Iraqi army) that have wrecked bold hopes ever since. More shambles from bureaucrat Bremer. Look at the Baghdad taps that don't flow to this day and the electricity that goes off and on. Look at the Big Uneasy.Of course, the cock-up theory of history dogs every jot of administrative life, from Stockwell tube station on. Of course, we have our own child support agencies and similar shames. And, of course, Whitehall probably wouldn't function too smoothly under six feet of water if the Thames barrier burst. Yet there is, from administration to administration, a problem here that is more than politics, vituperation and blame.America, for all its wealth and thirst for economic change, is a stagnant pond for constitutional reformers. Nothing fundamental changes much in the byzantine division of responsibilities between city, state and federal government - except that the states grow gradually more feeble as giant agencies come and go.Cheney, a supposed foe of bureaucracy, has steered his pupil in weird directions here - including the creation of a monstrous homeland security department, run by counter-terrorist hands, that has all but swallowed up poor Fema, the designated disasters agency. Would a dirty bomb in Bourbon Street have been better handled? Maybe. But dirty water was nowhere on Washington's radar.Put accusations of racial prejudice and callousness, however vehement, to one side for a moment and concentrate on the main event: a machine that didn't work when the waves swept in. The charge that lingers most acridly is one of incompetence, inertia, incapacity; and the means of putting that right stretch far beyond a few sackings and shufflings.Blame Bush? Naturally. This shambles is on his watch. But don't fail to ask the more difficult questions either. Does free-market scorn for public services and its salary structure make for third-rate public servants? Do election-related democratic upheavals of administrative tenure every four years bring expertise or confusion? Does our solitary superpower boast a superpowered administrative engine - or an old banger in need of total refurbishment? Don't ask poor George. This isn't his bag. But what about working it through one fine day in Wyoming?"
6,"Two things, after half a lifetime of trying to understand America, come suddenly together. One is the curious, seemingly mindless obsession with regulation that infects the land of the free. (A few weeks ago they detained a babe in arms at airport departure because his name was on their terrorist-suspect list.) The other is a perennial sense of looming disaster. But let's come to Katrina and Rita in a second. Meanwhile, other signs point the way.For years - a silly little holiday hobby - we've gone round the States taking pictures of the municipal notices they put up. ""Have fun and enjoy Santa Monica beach,"" for instance.""No fires or fireworks; dogs not permitted at any time; ball playing in designated areas only; must obey lifeguards' direction; no dressing or undressing; no tents or enclosures permitted; no sleeping midnight to 5am; must place rubbish in trash can; no alcoholic beverages; no glass containers; no percussion instruments"" - with the relevant city ordinance numbers tabulated down the side. (No percussion instruments, rule 4204C.)So ""fun"" is a carefully limited concept. And that, in part, is because inanimate objects can wreak havoc. ""Caution: nails, splinters, uneven deck, gaps between planks, bare feet and high-heel shoes are DANGEROUS."" It is also because nature itself heaves with threat. A scarlet skull and crossbones posted by the Grand Canyon reads: ""Danger: Extreme heat conditions exist in the canyon - Hiking may lead to Life Threatening Injury or Death!!""But, of course, the great, swilling sea means maximum menace. ""Swim near a lifeguard - Beware of rip currents, uneven ocean bottom, rocks, piers / pilings, jettys / groins. No diving in shallow water."" And more danger still dogs hundreds of miles of the Pacific: ""This coastline is naturally dynamic - crashing waves and crumbling cliffs. Rocks are slippery. Large, unexpected waves sweep people off their feet. Play it safe - don't climb rocks or go into the water and risk getting carried out to sea.""In Oregon, a few weeks ago, you saw full Hollywood horror lurking on the horizon. ""If you feel an earthquake - Protect yourself until the earthquake is over - Move quickly inland to high ground - Do not pack or delay - A tsunami may be coming in a few minutes ... "" Play it safe? Only, perhaps, by staying at home.Can such notices of imminent extinction be taken seriously, though - especially when, as on Venice Beach, they're close to an athletic centre where ""The ethics of paddle tennis and good sportsmanship shall prevail"" by similarly gruff decree? Not really. Too much bureaucracy douses any sense of fear. A warning ritually repeated is no warning at all. You forget what this big country is like.Now it's time to remember as Rita piles more debris along the Gulf and pushes New Orleans back into Katrina's ooze. In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen. But along America's south and east coasts, they have their regular lashing season of destruction. To the west, tsunamis may come, and come again, hours later. Blizzards spread from the north. Tornados from nowhere beat through Oklahoma. The San Andreas fault shifts sullenly, waiting for its moment. Mount St Helens never sleeps.Nature, in short, is a hostile force and repeated enemy. Most of Europe's disasters are man-made: mountain tunnels imploding, planes crashing, wars, hatreds. Most of America's, by contrast, are natural nightmares. And there's one gap in understanding.Did New Orleans react so sluggishly to Katrina because it was warned and warned again, warned into apathy? Perhaps, a little. Was Rita quite the monster a once-bitten met office warned against? Perhaps, not quite. But the struggle for perspective is constant. We can sit on more tranquil sidelines and cry ""global warming"". Yet America's next disaster may burst from beneath the earth or sea and have nothing to do with Kyoto.Did the BBC ""gloat"" over Katrina? Not that I saw. But that tired, glib line about ""the world's only superpower"" assumes that any power on earth can somehow staunch natural disasters. Not so. We are humbled time and again, from Sri Lanka to San Francisco. Our defences come down. Mortality engulfs the Big Easy as swiftly as Thailand. Stand on the slopes of Mount St Helens and, 25 years on, the dead forests of blasted trees bear witness to our impotence. Millions flee.And there, perhaps, the noticeboards of life and death come together, not just as bureaucracy striving for order, but as something Old Testament apocalyptic. The ten commandments of Santa Monica beach, with one commandment added for luck. Never forget plagues, pestilences and our terrible vulnerability. Be humble (and observe the due ethics of paddle tennis)."
6,"Sir Humphrey Appleby, lest you forget, was not some modern Whitehall creature. It's well over two decades since he first began stitching up the hapless Hacker on TV. And Hacker, in so far as he was anything to begin with, was probably a gimmick-prone, ideologically challenged Labour hack. (New Labour ahead of its time.) Other boots, other feet. But we do forget. The mood music of the Wilson and Callaghan 60s and 70s - usually with Barbara Castle leading the chorus - was all about a conniving civil service bent on burying socialism and any prospect of fundamental reform. Whitehall, in that time of failure and thwarted ambition, wasn't a superb service industry, the answer to every challenge. Whitehall was the problem, not the solution: the conservative enemy.  See what a difference a quarter of a century makes. Now it's streamlined Hackers like Stephen Byers who are the phantom menace; now it's steel-toothed hackerettes like Jo Moore who make Sir Humphrey cringe. The Appleby texts, in their serpentine evasiveness, may not have changed much. (""I was not accountable - but I was responsible,"" as Sir Richard Mottram told the public administration committee last week. ""Events sometimes catch you out."") What has changed, though, is the supposed balance of power.  We are solemnly invited to rally behind an embattled mandarin class - even to pass a new act of parliament which bulwarks that class's sacred role. We are solemnly instructed to cherish neutrality as though it was the holy grail of parfit administration.  That may be necessary for the outcome of the stale tale which involves thousands of evil spin doctors waging war on the highest standards of public service. But it is also, historically and practically, the most terrible twaddle (or ****ing twaddle, as Mottram might say in one of his events-strewn moments).  Pause over the facts. Our government, at the last count, had employed a mere 80 or so special advisers roaming the corridors, serving ministers one-on-one. They are pitted against well over 3,000 top civil servants, who live ""in fear"" of their interventions and importunate demands. It doesn't sound much of a contest, does it? The numbers of outsiders involved are puny. The expertise they bring doesn't usually extend far beyond a certain knowingness in media relations.  What, then, is the fuss about - a fuss which reaches far beyond Ms Moore into draft legislation and the inquiry officially launched by the committee on standards in public life? There must be a crisis because there is so much fuss.  In any other walk of public life, I guess, a sceptical Hacker and Appleby would know exactly what to make of this debate - because they'd know they were being set up. Police chiefs complaining about neighbourhood security guards, headteachers complaining about classroom assistants, RMT drivers complaining about Aslef - they'd see the angles coming from bleak experience. They'd know, at least in part, what this protective racket portended.  Here, however, the racket-makers wear dark suits and darker looks. They belong not to a common or garden trade union, but to the grandly titled First Division Association. Their paid representatives come down from the mountain tops of probity to defend them. They assert the existence of threat, and feel no need to soil their hands with proving it. They can set the retiring cabinet secretary dancing to their tune, voicing his belated alarm. They can outmanoeuvre a prime minister by exposing his weakest link: fear of unpopularity in the polls. The 80 interlopers - the security patrollers and classroom assistants in this game - are to be corralled and limited by statute. The battle against marauders is swiftly won.  Oh, excellent Humphrey! A sordid dust-up in a cubbyhole called the Department of Transport press office and bigger issues go begging. Victory has seldom seemed so sweet. And yet there are much bigger issues. Why, for instance, should the first division 3,000 be spared the scrutiny which normally accompanies disappointment?   This is the age for kicking bureaucrats - in Brussels, in local government, in the health service. ""Faceless"" pen-pushers carry every can. Yet not, apparently, in Whitehall. When grave men are fielded to observe how far the Blair boys have strayed off course, their spokesman is a retired permanent secretary from the permanently retired Min of Ag. Yet nobody lays the disasters of BSE or foot and mouth anywhere adjacent to his door, just as nobody blames Health for NHS sickness or Education for the endless exam disasters. Mandarins can be blamed for not spending ministers' money fast enough: otherwise, seemingly, they're in the clear.  Everyone close to the action privately acknowledges that some departments are weaker than others. Education always has been and always will be weak. Who, with ambition, wants to work there? Health is becoming a similar graveyard. Transport and local government don't go together, a jerry-built monstrosity. And anyone who deals - day-to-day - with Whitehall press offices recognises instinctively the need for a better kind of spin doctoring: these regular, neutral guys are mostly journeymen and women. Not even Nationwide League.  There's no cause for blame here, of course. How could there be? Governments come and go, and all - out loud or under their breath - agree that private management must have its public place: in schools, hospitals, local provision. But curiously, apart from a few star signings, that does not apply to the most elevated public management of the lot. There may be a whispered shortage of talent: that's why Whitehall salaries are heading for the £200,000 mark (with increasingly a pension to dream of). But there is no crisis of confidence; nor any thought that a machine running on empty for too long needs to be traded in.  Thus the aftermath of the Byers debacle (like the debacle itself) is almost impossible to follow. It asserts a success for the system which Mottram's ""events"" in no way bear out. It claims virtue for a neutrality which doesn't exist. It holds - uniquely in British life - that what was good for the 20th century must, unchanged and unquestioned, be good for the 21st.  More twaddle. The question about special advisers is why, in a complex age, governments need them. The question about press departments is why they aren't better at their job. The question about governance is why politicians are so shy of shifting the focus where it needs to be (that is, not always obsessively on themselves). And the question about the committee of standards in public life is whether - run by an ex-mandarin, as so much in this life is - it can break the mould of unscrutinised tradition.  Too many questions, Humphrey? Too much smoke and too little fire?  There, there minister - time to lie down while I order you a nice cup of Earl Grey."
4,"Babies and elections have always been, in the jargon of the moment, contiguous. This time round, there is a difference. Now babymania can jump species. Phoenix the calf, an emblem of Disney cuteness among mountains of scorched flesh, gets the livestock cull curtailed. Less flamboyantly, the 750,000 human infants born every year in Britain also score a victory. Each will soon have a dowry of £250 apiece, rising to £500 for the poorest. With three further top-ups of £100 and a government promise to match any family contributions, the least well-off 18-year-olds should end up with a modest nest egg, courtesy of the four fairy godfathers of government. David Blunkett is the political driver for the Child Trust Fund, successfully piloted in the US over the past decade and imported by the left-wing think tank, the IPPR. Alistair Darling is also keen on asset-building. An ominous silence hung over the Treasury when baby bonds were first mooted before Gordon Brown eventually proclaimed himself in favour of a plan designed to ensure that every newborn will enter the world with the word 'Prudence' practically stamped on his or her brow. As for Tony Blair, this idea had everything.  To the Right, it offered the camphorous odour of Thatcher's mothballed credo of a property-owning democracy. Baby-bonders would, in the Tory view, be the spiritual heirs to the Sids who snapped up shares and council houses.  To the Left, it bore the equally comforting whiff of progressive universalism. While the scheme's foundation, on the shaky faultline where Beveridge and   neo-liberalism collide, rendered it acceptable to almost all, the plan has a special resonance for Blair. In his 1999 conference speech, he described two babies, side by side in the labour ward and destined, if he had his wish, to live in a meritocratic society where all began life on an equal footing. Baby bonds match the policy to the dream. Better still, a scheme costing a modest £1 billion a year offers a branding unbuyable even by a government that splurges £62 million on three months' worth of advertising. This, the subtext reads, is an administration that loves poor children.  And still, our child poverty rate is the third highest in the industrialised world: 100,000 more children were plunged into hardship during the first two years of the Blair government. Although changes to tax and benefits have reversed that trend, more than three million children will remain below the breadline at the election. Of those, 600,000 of them could have been removed from income poverty if the £2.4bn forgone by last year's cut in the basic tax rate had been used to increase benefits.  Regressive taxes on cigarettes and petrol continue to clobber the poor, as does the Social Fund. The Social Security Select Committee recently reported that the fund, a model of Dickensian parsimony, exacerbates child poverty because parents cannot afford to repay crisis loans for items such as fridges and cookers. So far, the Government has resisted subsequent calls for a review.  As ever, the children of poor households continue to do worse at school and to get the worst-paid jobs, or none. By their late teens, that damage may be irreversible. Certainly the notion that 18-year-olds will emerge from a chrysalis of poverty into fully formed trustafarians, ready to spend with care (rather than to squander their money on drugs and drink as their rich-list equivalents tend to) seems unproven.  Nor are parents struggling to buy food and shoes likely to be sustained by the knowledge that their children are custodians of untouchable funds worth several thousand pounds. Perhaps such caveats count for little against a suspicion that approval from those debarred by extreme poverty from saving, including the seven out of 10 lone parents who currently have no back-up funds at all, is not the applause Labour most desires.  Despite last week's volte-face  allowing more generous parental leave, women of all backgrounds remain sceptical of a government perceived to have done too little on childcare provision and flexible working hours. So how helpful to have news programmes full of vox pops involving wards full of new 'mums' (not a father in sight, even on politically correct  Channel 4 News ) offering warm plaudits to Blair's largesse.  Though it would be cynical to accuse the Government of blatantly touting for votes among those impressed by its drive towards child equality, there is no doubt that some remain more equal than others. One minute, the Government is offering Hans Christian Andersen fairytale outcomes, in which all must have equal prospects. In the next, it sketches cautionary tales worthy of a Hoffman or a Belloc, on what must happen to those corrupted by the forces of exclusion.  Slap a curfew or a school exclusion order on them. March 'yobs' to cashpoints or incarcerate them in one of our scandalous young offenders' institutions to rot or, if especially unlucky, to die. Tony Blair's latest wheeze, to reward non-offending teenagers in high crime areas with vouchers for CDs or trainers, looks either like a belated balance of carrot to stick or the feeblest of pre-election gimmicks.  It may also be a sign that Blair, an expert on wayward adolescents    and infant innocents alike, has a Dr Spockish urge to treat the nation's children as his own. The trouble is that parenting is a haphazard, emotional affair, whereas politics is structured and calculating. Conflate the two and the upshot is the liberal press gurgling over Blair's plans while the  Daily Telegraph, simultaneously, infers the extinction of the welfare state and the advent of a US-style residuum.  The suspicion is that Blair is bowing to the perception that the views of Left and Right must, like the rich child and the poor, be equally indulged. In addition, political entrail-reading usefully magnifies the scope of what's really on offer. Baby bonds, and an allied savings scheme for poor adults, are a valuable gesture, but a tiny one. Suggesting that they are the foundation of a DIY society is as unrealistic as hoping to buy Chatsworth with Green Shield stamps.  Last week, Blair's personal think tank filled in the gaps on an anti-poverty strategy. The Performance and Innovation Unit urged him to increase income and inheritance tax and end the middle-class stranglehold on getting the best education. A meritocratic society depended, it said, on high social mobility and the absence of any association between class and opportunity. Such truisms bear repetition in a week when Blair plans to stick to his 1997 pledge not to put up income tax while his 'People's Peers', a Gilbert and Sullivan array of toffery, make the notion of democratic appointments look risible.  As for baby bonds, the enthusiasm of its reception should make Labour bolder and less disingenuous. Though the sketch is vague and the budget small, we would love it to work. But voters also know that children's lives cannot be transformed unless direct taxes rise. Blair should flesh out his trust plan, reform the Social Fund, step up the crusade to end child poverty by 2020 and concede that notions of forging equality on the cheap belong in the realm of storks and gooseberry bushes."
4,"The English language, spat out in a dribble of bile and asterisks, has rarely been so abused. The most graphic exponent of the new art of coarse speaking is Roy Keane, the Manchester United captain, whose memoir explains how he deliberately injured the Norway international, Alf Inge Haaland. 'I'd waited long enough. I f***ing hit him hard. The ball was there, I think. Take that, you c***.'  Noel Gallagher's thoughts on the American music industry, as delivered to the  New York Post, sound even further removed from the vernacular of Jane Austen, while, at the Edinburgh fringe, the comedy writer Barry Cryer has denounced the relentless crudeness of this year's offerings.   The contagion has seeped into such outposts of the community as Crazy George's discount furniture store in Chatham, Kent, where Peter Moore, a customer, demanded of a trainee manageress: 'Who's the f***ing bitch who had a go at my missus?' Sentencing Mr Moore for abuse, Judge Keith Simpson suggested that it would be no bad thing if the courts were empowered to wash out the foul mouths of miscreants with carbolic soap, assuming it was still available.   If carbolic was not remaindered around the time that shower gel got invented and Anthony Buckeridge's 'fossilised fishhooks' stopped being the literary expletive of choice, then the Royal College of Nursing could use some. The case of Pat Bottrill made all other examples of offensiveness seem mild. Her sin was to mention 'ten little niggers' in an allusion to the Agatha Christie novel whose characters, much like RCN delegates on a coffee break, disappeared without trace. Instead, Ms Bottrill vanished after her resignation as chair of the governing council was accepted by the American head of the RCN, Beverly Malone.   The linkage between US sensibilities and the N-word is established. Some time ago, an American lawyer was reportedly forced to give up his public post when a member of a lecture audience took exception to his correct use of the word niggardly, meaning stingy or miserly. Even when better semantic logic applies, offending people is subjective. Those who agree with the  Times , which serialised Roy Keane's book, that his thuggish musings are the imprimatur of 'tormented genius' might take umbrage at Gwyneth Paltrow's line on British men, or  Thought for the Day's affinity for God.   Defending insulting behaviour is, by contrast, simple. The term 'nigger', as thoughtlessly used by Ms Bottrill, is different from the same word screamed from the Millwall terraces by thugs with plankton brains. If Ms Bottrill had been the Alf Garnett of the bedpan, her lapse might have looked different, but the fact that she was horrified enough to relinquish her post was proof of innocence.   The shame is that no colleague or superior was brave or wise enough to point out that the fuss over her error was spurious nonsense. Other examples include the complaint about Home Office Minister John Denham's reference, at the Police Federation Conference, to 'nitty gritty'. The charge that the phrase referred to a debris, mainly composed of lice and left in the scuppers of a slave ship after a voyage, came as news to black people, lexicographers included. No case to answer.   Conversely, it was incontrovertible that Ann Winterton should lose her Tory frontbench post after telling a joke at a rugby club dinner about Pakistani citizens being ten a penny. Her humour was dire, her speech premeditated and her timing, the day after the British   National Party won three council seats in Burnley, atrocious.   The only mystery on racial sensitivity is why bodies like the RCN choose to court the derision of the Right. The Bottrill case tapped into the familiar vein of scorn for imagined legions of politically correct, hatchet-faced lentil-slurpers who forbid the use of spoon (Cockney rhyming slang for coon) and frown on Wodehouse's reference to 'good eggs' (ditto). Fabricating examples of weird behaviour, such as Brent Council's non-existent ban on schoolchildren watching the Queen Mum's funeral or Islington teachers singing 'Baa Baa Green Sheep', seems hardly necessary when the RCN obliges with the genuine article.   Every fuss about political correctness masks the fact that, in schools and offices, there is too little attention to anti-racist education and training, not too much. Each new furore validates right-wing prejudice. There is another danger. At best, care over racial etiquette produces the sort of changes that make Agatha Christie's novel title and free golliwogs with jam jars look prehistoric. At worst, it is an anaesthetic to the liberal conscience. Attention to detail is a smokescreen against having to admit what a racist society this can be.   Terror of uttering an inappropriate word or venturing into the minefield of racial humour suggests awkward distance rather than inclusiveness. Atoning for any lapse by allowing some sacrificial victim, like Ms Bottrill, to be singed on the bonfire of the sensibilities is pointless. Such patronising gestures are unlikely to reassure those who couldn't give a stuff about RCN internal politics but who worry about having swastikas daubed on their houses or excrement posted through their doors.   Mantras of equality, diversity and ending institutional racism easily translate into the illusion of progress that isn't there. A white man is still three times more likely to get a professional job than a black one; only 3.7 per cent of prison   staff and 3.1 per cent of police officers come from ethnic minorities. Hysteria may be the fault of the ignorant or the malign, but every bogus bit of scaremongering by doomful prophets of population explosion bears testament to a liberal failure properly to explain why, humane considerations aside, immigration is an economic necessity.   That inability is rooted in taboos and confusion. Under a new paradox, equality legitimises unfairness. Raj Chandran, of the Commission For Racial Equality, was right to decry Ms Bottrill's departure, but the commission's recent record is even less glowing than the RCN's. Gurbux Singh's Roy Keane moment, in which he got drunk on corporate hospitality before bullying and threatening police officers, secured him a £120,000 pay-off and strangely muted criticism.   The commission, now casting round for a new head, has been tainted. Government largess for Mr Singh only underlined the suspicion that the CRE, overly keen on PR and occasionally inept, is more in thrall to the Home Office than to clients in serious need of back-up. Our treatment of asylum-seekers sometimes borders on the barbaric. Tension mounts in cities and beyond. In rural Devon, racial incidents rose by 20 per cent last year, and the far Right is out for blood. A mood of fear is building in the media. Clamp down on immigration. Bring back capital punishment for paedophiles, and blame any resistance to the politics of vengeance on what ranters still deem the lunatic Left. Such retributive nonsense is made worse by unkind or absurd behaviour posturing as purity of heart."
4,"Politician's families shouldn't dabble in policy. The odium heaped on Cherie Booth over a dozen coded words on Palestine showed how rigidly this maxim is applied. Unless you happen to be a son of the Home Secretary. Last week's decision to scrap the snoopers' charter was partly informed by Hugh Blunkett, a computer specialist of no formal constitutional status, who advised his dad to back off plans for wider access to communications data. A child's intervention is not the same as a wife's. Nor did Hugh publicly query Home Office policy. Even so, the contrast was odd. Exaggerated newspaper reports asserting that the Minister's son had singlehandedly overturned a draft order conferred Socratic wisdom on Blunkett Minor. Ms Booth, less gloriously, was branded a Hamas cheerleader, operating far outside her remit.  The distinction is simple. Hugh Blunkett is a hero because everyone wants their emails kept private. Cherie Booth is pilloried not because her allusion to the hopelessness of young suicide bombers was too political, but because the Right don't like what they think she was saying. If she had argued for, say, the restitution of the married couples' tax allowance or clemency for householders who murder burglars, the reaction would have been the opposite. Ms Booth, absolved of sins ranging from banging on about human rights to wearing pixie boots at the races, would have been hailed as the advocate of reason.  Instead, an apology was issued from Downing Street, where her remark may also have caused alarm. Although the Government opposes Israeli occupation and demands a Palestinian state, the suspicion is that stick-with-Bush pragmatism comes first. Besides, Mr Blair   has been this way before. When Jack Straw, quick to offer a qualified defence of Cherie, upset Ariel Sharon by making a very similar point about despair in Palestine, the Prime Minister had to intervene to salvage last September's peace talks.  This, one imagines, has been a lonely week for Cherie, an offender against the orthodoxies of the cautious Left and the bullish Right. Some who fit neither template will be repelled by her sentiments. Others will agree with her and think they understand what underlies one sentence, awkwardly blurted out. A member of a generation drawn into politics by outrage over Palestine's fate, she is also a mother involved with charities for the young. Why would she not be appalled by the fate of children bred for immolation?  To infer disregard for dead Israeli citizens is wrong. Those who suggested that she would have been in the clear had she deplored the latest bus bomb may have been shiny humanitarians, but most came across as hypocrites advising the spun platitudes they affect to despise.  How political can Cherie Booth afford to be? The last high-profile outsider to invite a similar furore was Gretta Duisenberg, who draped the Palestinian flag over her apartment balcony in Amsterdam. Despite relenting after death threats against her and pleas from her husband, Wim, Mrs Duisenberg remained imperious. She might be married to the head of the European Central Bank, but she was a free woman who could do what she wanted. While Ms Booth may not share Mrs Duisenberg's views, she might envy her ability to air them.  For partners of senior British politicians, liberty has traditionally been strictly rationed and tact mandatory. Obviously, there have been lapses. On being informed, in 1937, that the leader of the Opposition was to get a salary, a gleeful Violet Attlee told the press that at last she would be able to afford enough maids to run her   home properly.  Ramsay MacDonald's wife was so lacking in Liz Hurley-style presentational skills that when someone bought her an expensive blouse for a Downing Street function, she wore it back to front. Tory partners have been more reliably schooled never to shock and to intervene in politics only  in extremis. Thus, when Alec Douglas-Home began a premier's speech: 'I'm very glad to be here in Moscow', his wife saved him by hissing into one ear: 'Peking, Alec, Peking.'  Years on, and despite mould-breakers like Glenys Kinnock, etiquette cautions leaders' spouses to be solid, silent and supportive. Folklore still decrees that a politician has no greater asset than a family. This idea should have expired around the time that David Mellor arranged his then wife and children on a five-barred gate for the photocall intended to eclipse his affair with Antonia de Sancha and rescue his political career.  John Major's conflation of sexual morality and party diktat produced an impressive enough array of unfaithful Ministers and stand-by-your-man loyalists to undermine his government and make the Hamiltons the patron saints of uxorious virtue. Long after back to basics fizzled out, the political family remains a dubious image-builder.  Families are often a poor barometer for policy, as the 'Euan test' for Blair's Dome showed. Teenage sons get drunk, or scowl through photocalls, and even babies offer unforeseen perils, particularly if lacking full MMR certification. Mayor Livingstone, busy denying allegations of a brawl following a row because his pregnant girlfriend was smoking, never had this trouble as a singleton newt-fancier.  The moral is that families are messy, unpredictable and a world apart from   Norma Major's chintzy idyll of Teasmades and cheese-freezing. Just how political a statement this image actually was became clear when Norma was finally wheeled out as the Tories' 'secret weapon'; an emblem of proper wifeliness to counter Cherie, silent but pushy. Since then, Ms Booth has revolutionised the role of consort; chairing Downing Street summits and challenging her husband's government in court.  She has been mostly, but not always, skilful. Her wish for a public platform, coupled with privacy on demand, has sometimes seemed an uneasy fit, especially to critics alert for any addendum to an encylopaedia of alleged faults, ranging from cellulite and yawning in church to getting the MoD to help with homework and usurping the role of PM. If her critics were less dim, they would see that Ms Booth is potentially their greatest ally.  Her Middle East remark was not a blunder. It was the sign of someone prepared, in an age of the tame and the mute, to hold an unscripted belief and air it. This tendency is likely to trouble Labour spin-doctors at least as much as the Tory media. Any whiff of indiscretion on Cherie's part raises the interesting question of what, for example, she might think about her husband's plans for victim-led justice, scrapping double jeopardy and docking benefit from parents whose children play truant.  How much more useful if we knew. A modern democracy eager for transparency is intelligent and wise enough to distinguish between the views of elected representatives and their unelected spouses. Why on earth shouldn't Ms Booth offer her views like any other citizen and justify them herself?  Presumably because it suits too many enemies to portray her as a meddlesome self-promoter and too many friends to pass her off as a penitent who erred. She should regard last week not as a humiliation but as the first move against all those who think the safe response to crises, however grave or heartrending, is a blend of nodding-dog politics and muzzled women."
4,"Osama Bin Laden's house has made the Turner Prize shortlist. In a tame year, Ben Langlands and Nikki Bell's virtual tour of its subterranean rooms has provoked none of the outrage inspired by the Tate's last venture into real estate: Rachel Whiteread's inside-out 'House', the 1993 winner, caused much more fuss, mostly among fans of neo-classical villas with up-and-over garage doors. Chez Osama does not compare, either, with Saddam's rat hole or Hitler's bunker. Rather, it has the look of the sort of over-priced Cretan folly featured in Channel 4's No Going Back. Just as the show's exiles renounce Droitwich or Scunthorpe, so bin Laden left his rural retreat for Kandahar and, most recently, a mountain bolthole on the Afghan-Pakistan border. Even if unaware of his entre into Britart, he cannot be ignorant of his diminishing profile in less cultural circles. Once, the West was so fixated by the power, psyche and presence of the supreme sponsor of Islamic terrorism that he was treated like a monstrous mutant of David Beckham. And then it all went quiet. In the way of a fading rocker, the world's most wanted man normally has to release a video or recording in order to attract publicity. Otherwise, the roster of international atrocities - Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco, Madrid - elicits horror of al-Qaeda, and fewer references to its darkest agent. That is partly because the notion of al-Qaeda as an idea, rather than a Marks &amp; Spencer of terrorism with bin Laden at the corporate apex, is better understood. In addition, as Simon Jenkins has suggested, he has collected scalps beyond his dreams. With Greg Dyke, Piers Morgan and Jos Maria Aznar gone, and George W. Bush and Tony Blair vulnerable, few choose to emphasise bin Laden's shrewdness. Early drafts of history underline his luck. The US national commission into 9/11 has, in the past days, thrown up such evidence of rivalry between police and firefighters that bereaved families are now turning on the authorities. Former Mayor Giuliani's suggestion that New Yorkers should save their fury for the terrorists alone has been greeted coldly by the media. On the international bagatelle board, the ball unleashed by bin Laden crashes on, with George Bush's hand on the flipper as the scoreline of destruction flashes higher. A wedding party in Mukaradeeb is bombed by US troops, and 40 die. Children are gunned down by Israeli forces in Rafah. Every step to nemesis underlines the hunch that the smart political thinking is being done in a cave in the Hindu Kush, rather than Crawford, Texas. Gloom about Iraq is no longer just for peaceniks. The former head of US Central Command told the Senate foreign relations committee last week: 'We are looking into the abyss.' As the coalition continues to dig that gulf, it is time to reconsider the man who provided the spade. Osama bin Laden is nowhere near as alien as he looks. His creed, and his actions, are unthinkable, but he is also our invention. History, the nightmare from which James Joyce was 'trying to awake', is being widely invoked now, but politicians' bad dreams are not of the past. If they knew much about it, they might never have blundered into such a crucible of rebellion. The Iraq adventure was built on other foundations. An enlightened occupier would remove tyranny and enable a secular democracy, while smashing the jihadists' notion, equally far-fetched, that the world can be shaped to their vision by grand-scale massacres. Bush's war on terror, never a clash of civilizations, was really a collision of two myths. Bin Laden fitted this scenario. As Marina Warner has written, combat leg ends, detailing the struggle between a hero and a diabolical enemy, have gained new energy from the current world crisis. From Theseus, Hercules and St George to the fables of J.K. Rowling or Philip Pullman, every slayer needs a dragon. Bush's reworking of the old story of good versus evil was built round a doe-eyed destroyer repellent to all reasonable people of every faith and none, and therefore doomed. Fairytales have vicious undercurrents, as the Grimm Brothers knew. They also tarnish easily. When exposed to real life, stage coaches become pumpkins, and the mythic melts into the mundane. Saddam, a monster on the run, became a hood with a bad beard, the bleary-eyed recipient of flossing tips from a US orthodontist. His regime retains its legendary horror, but its creator, stripped of lustre, has been shuffled off to some obscure cell. No one talks about him much any more. No doubt bin Laden, exemplifying Hannah Arendt's 'banality of evil', would seem equally diminished by captivity. He would not, obviously, be more wholesome. In reality, pathologically murderous tyrants are fairly irredeemable. The etiquette of fantasy, a little kinder, decrees that, while the bad mostly remain so, there is some capacity for role reversal. In Beauty and the Beast, the villain is transformed by the heroine's charm and beauty. In the latest parody unveiled at Abu Ghraib, the 'beast' is an Iraqi prisoner, his peaceful face belying a grim death. The 'beauty', gloating as rubber-gloved fingers dance above his corpse, is Sabrina Harman, a young American guard. The heroes have become the monsters, in a twist made possible by the fact that the good guys, or their string-pullers, had no automatic claim to virtue. Bush and Blair's error, noticeable to any Listen with Mother audience, was not to notice that compromised regimes make poor fairy godmothers. The idea of Saddam as too monstrous to exist never sat easily with the West's role in his survival. We are seeing now what happens when interventionists substitute their own mythology for other people's histories. Such distortions turn dangerous zealots into icons. A poll conducted for the Iraq Center for Research and Strategic Studies, reports that Moqtada al-Sadr, the Shia fundamentalist regarded until recently as a low-grade thug by his fellow-believers, is suddenly the second most popular figure in Iraq. No wonder Osama bin Laden is chiefly mentioned as a 7/2 shot for the Turner. The West wants to downplay his role in a soured crusade. And still, despite the evidence of failure, new fables emerge. Against all appearances, the story goes, the war on terror is being won. In Iraq, the magic wand of handover will turn today's debacle into tomorrow's democracy. It is time to go back to chapter one. Bin Laden, far from being a storybook lord of darkness assured of a sticky end, was, and is, a ruthless political foe well on the way to fulfilling his stated aims. The US has pulled its troops out of Saudi Arabia, as he wished, and the regime is unstable. A polarised world, his number one ambition, looks more inevitable by the day. A new Iraqi leader is about to be named, and a new security council resolution tabled. What happens next will determine the future of Iraq, the region and perhaps the world. The fantasy of Osama bin Laden may be forestalled only if the US coalition, in thrall to myth, can finally sift the real from the imagined."
4,"Baroness Jay is to stand down from the Cabinet to see more of her granddaughter and, as an incidental bonus, fewer of the irksome headlines that have dogged her during her time as Leader of the Lords. Not that snipers are likely to have deterred her. At 61, she simply wishes to achieve what an aide calls a 'better work/life balance'. What an emblem she will be at a time when the stereotypes of creeping age are dead. Whatever balance Lady Jay achieves, it is unlikely to feature midweek bingo and holidays in Frinton. She will not be expected to peruse, for as long as the cataracts hold off, adverts for Dr Werner's denture fixative, pre-arranged funerals, incontinence pads, stairlifts and sunshine homes for the terminally confused.  These days, the elderly call the shots. Shops and service providers target the grey pound. Politicians court the grey vote, and the discriminatory notion that employers must force people to leave when they become eligible for the state pension expired last week. From 2006, it will be illegal, under EU law, to stipulate a compulsory retirement date in an employment contract. This provision, hailed as upholding human rights, also gets the country out of a hole. There are now four workers for every pensioner. By 2050, without a rise in retirement age or an immigration total of one million a year, the ratio will be two to one.   By then, a quarter of Britons will be over 65. Already, the over-50s represent one third of the UK population, have a collective income of £166 billion, hold 80 per cent of Britain's wealth and 60 per cent of UK savings. In short, they are    loaded. Retailers fawn on them, while failing to establish what this strange, new breed wants or needs. A contributor to a recent anthology called  The Definitive Guide to Mature Advertising And Marketing solemnly advises that home-shopping catalogues targeted at oldies should offer dress sizes up to 34, footwear of an EEE fitting and expandable trousers. 'Today's 50 year olds have worn jeans for 30-plus years,' the author (clearly a student of the T. Blair informal dress code) writes. 'Consequently, success is gained by flattering youthful aspirations and offering jeans with discreet side elastication for extra comfort.'   How misunderstood the ageing are. For a start, 50 seems quite young to anyone but a creative director or a fruit fly. In addition, oldies do not, in general, have feet broader than telephone directories and bottoms resembling mattresses. They are, instead, skipping round like Baroness Jay and compiling a new lifestyle portfolio, or booking Saga cruises to the Galapagos, or brushing up on their golf swing or Mandarin. It is hard to see why this vibrant Sanatogen set should not carry on working, particularly since a retirement age of 65, or 60 for women, was established in Britain half a century ago to fit the narrow span between the gold watch and the grave.   Now, according to a report by the Centre for Policy Studies, the Government's promise to pay the basic state pension to future pensioners represents an unrecognised liability of £1,000bn. The longer people work, the less acute the pensions problem becomes. But the calculation also involves well-being. Last week, the  Guardian held up Bobby Robson, 67, and John Mortimer, 77, as examples of contented older workers who, but for their choice of football and writing, would have been out on their ears long ago. Instead, Mr Mortimer's life seems a pleasant round of parties and book signings and languorous champagne lunches.  No doubt Lincolnshire beetroot-picklers or conductors on the Kilburn night bus or stressed-out teachers would also be delighted to put in a few   extra years if the Krug and hours were right. Whether headteachers want to take up Margaret Hodge's kind suggestion of a classroom job after 65 'to lessen the pressure as they got older' seems quite another matter.   For now, sticking around is rarely encouraged. Unwanted executives step aside at 55 with a fat pension and a mutual sigh of relief. Good policemen rarely stay beyond 50 because, under existing pension rules, it would be financial suicide to do so. Whitehall despatches its employees at 60, while others simply get booted out when they are deemed to have reached their use-by date. Only 37 per cent of men still work by the age of 64, and the Louis MacNiece axiom - 'Sit on your arse for 40 years and hang your hat on a pension' - is for serious time-servers only.   Reversing the pattern will be hard, not least because many who can afford it quite like the idea of 30 years of indolence. Change may, despite pious talk of rights and choice, involve compulsion. For Britain to retain the same balance between workers and retired people over the next half century would mean raising the retirement age to 72. Already Iceland's threshold is 70, Norway's and Denmark's is 67, and in Italy, where the birth rate is dropping faster than anywhere in Europe, workers regularly slog on until 75. Whatever compact Britain eventually reaches - hopefully more immigration, a move towards funded pensions and encouraging, but not forcing, people to work longer - its success will depend on making the poorest better valued and rewarded.   The new spotlight on old people   gleams on a supposedly homogeneous breed. They, increasingly, are the dominant workers, consumers and electors. An Age Concern survey last week showed that six million elderly voters have still not decided which party to support. In 1997, 38 per cent backed Labour and 29 per cent Tory. If that position were reversed - as it was in a Gallup poll last summer - Labour would have won 349 seats instead of 418. No wonder both Hague and Blair are full of blandishments for the elderly. Labour's deal, skewed longer-term towards helping the poorest, is brave considering what is at stake. It is also the only solution.   Old age is not synonymous with poverty any more. Over the past 20 years, pensioners have done twice as well as the general population. But while share-owning and occupational and personal pensions have underpinned a 60 per cent growth in income, the divide between rich and poor has widened dramatically. That gap must be narrowed now, not only for fairness but also, more expediently, because this is perhaps the last generation of pensioners that will vote for altruism.   Affluent older people are the volunteers - the cancer-shop workers or meals-on-wheels deliverers - who see the poverty among those of their peers who get the worst NHS treatments, a pitiful pension and a life of isolation imposed, in part, by an abysmal transport system. The next generation of wealthy pensioners will be a Peter Pan collection of gym-toned, cryogenically-preserved, smooth-browed Eminem fans whose long juggling of the 'work/life balance' may blind them to the fact that others have little life and less work to weigh.   The world grows older by the minute, The future is grey. There is nothing alarming in that evolution, beyond the fact that if the current gulf persists, a twenty-first century population composed of sprightly, globe-bestriding, vitamin-popping, nine-to-five-working octogenarians will only be camouflage for a society increasingly polarised between rich and poor."
4,"By the time Posh Spice admitted that her lip ring was a fake, the piercing parlours of Britain had been inundated by imitators. 'She is a real cow,' said one hole-punched acolyte. 'She must have known fans would copy her.' Of course. Every time Posh's husband has some new variant personal topiary, a cloned army turns out with Mohican haircuts or half an eyebrow. Who knows better than the Beckhams that we are the most susceptible nation on earth? The Government, for one. A policy consultant to the Department of Health claims that  EastEnders and Coronation Street have replaced the State as the main source of sex education for children. Simultaneously, Tony Blair is being urged by liberal commentators to borrow his thinking on teenage pregnancy and lone parents from more dubious sources. Bill Clinton's tough love is working, according to two US think-tanks. Compulsion and welfare withdrawal have wrought a miracle. Fewer teenagers get pregnant. More single mothers go out to work. Left-wing Jeremiahs predicting misery and poverty have been proved wrong. Except they haven't.  The think-tank findings, like Clinton's initiative, are nothing new. We have known for some time that the US cut its welfare bill by $9 billion between 1992 and 1998. That period showed a 40 per cent reduction in those claiming benefit, and the number of lone parents working rose from 44 to 57 per cent. We also know the dire trends underpinning the headline results. Coercion and a five-year lifetime limit on claiming welfare meant that the poorest were left to sink. Of the supposed success stories, almost half of those who found work earned less than they got on benefit. Two-thirds of welfare-leavers in Wisconsin lived below the US poverty line.  A moral climate in which parents go on Oprah to renounce their 'welfare mother' status as if they are kicking heroin has no resonance in Britain. Nor is there much appetite for a system that forces mothers to return to live with hostile parents or violent partners as the alternative to destitution. But, beyond all that, there is no crisis here. As One Parent Families points out, lone parent families have stabilised at around 1.7 million. Teenage pregnancies are the lowest since 1994. The divorce rate is falling. Big problems remain, but the statistics do not invite panic, let alone a return to a sterile quest to manipulate social behaviour by economic whip-cracking.  The debate over whether such tactics could work was held and lost in the Eighties. And yet, curiously, the new American research has not been questioned here. Its findings, whiskery and disturbing, have been greeted effusively. Blair is being chivvied to abandon his crusade to eliminate child poverty in favour of compulsion, cruelty and creating a new caste of the destitute.  Why are we suddenly so gullible? The answer goes wider than social policy. Increasingly, we are trapped in a copycat culture that seeps into almost every area of life. Everyone, the theory goes, does everything better than us. We can't boil an egg unless Delia shows us how, or paint the spare bedroom in any shade of emulsion lacking the Carol Smillie imprimatur, or pull up a weed without first consulting Charlie Dimmock's breasts. A  Radio Times survey last week claimed that more than one in two Britons does not necessarily need human contact but feels lonely if deprived of a television role model. Private reliance on the views and the guidance of strangers, however, is mild compared with the filching habit of the magpies in the public domain. Like a snoopy neighbour wanting the loan of a cup of sugar, the Government is continually on the borrow from next door.  Required items for the national begging bowl this week include the following: 1. More foreign doctors and nurses, as usual. Plus French and German hospital beds for sprightly South-East dwellers. Sick and elderly northerners must continue, usefully, to clog up the waiting-lists that Alan Milburn needs as the chief rationing tool for an inadequate health service. 2. Some teachers. Lightly qualified Australian back-packers welcome, along with graduates from Africa and India. This, as the head of VSO has said, is not recruitment. It is looting by a country terrifyingly bereft of its own resources and ideas.  Globalisation means a homogenised world of Starbucks, Gap and sponsored Labour Party conference events run like a Big Mac franchise, but that does not fully explain the deadweight of British dependency. Even last week's Zagat guide survey claiming that London is better than Paris for eating out fell short of an all-out endorsement of Britishness. Eight of the 10 highest-ranked restaurants are French-based. By way of reciprocity, the French are mad for  Bottom and Ab Fab, all of which show the British as sad and manic losers. The reason that the copy movie,  Absolument Fabuleux, has just bombed in French cinemas is partly because a self-confident nation can't emulate the savage self-satire engendered by a country undergoing a nervous collapse.  The flipside of our insecurity is always bombast. We may see ourselves as Blair's 'new internationalists', imbued with chicken tikka massala multiculturalism, but the media mood is for xenophobia. Off go our football fans, a Union Jack-draped yobocracy encouraged to view the Germans as sausage-chomping towel tyrants. In come euro notes and we are invited to pity those who must forgo the Queen and Sir Edward Elgar for ugly modernity. The message is that we are too individualistic and our culture too distinctive ever to bow to bland uniformity. If only. We are the Arthur Daley of the planet, engaged in a global rip-off campaign that extends from pizza toppings to maths teachers.  It isn't quite, as Samuel Johnson said, that almost all absurdity of conduct arises 'from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble'. The additional problem is that we steal the wrong things from the wrong people. Gordon Brown, a Class A raider, quite usefully poached American schemes ranging from the Roosevelt-style New Deal to the tax breaks that created the US enterprise explosion of the Nineties as central planks of his policy. More dubiously, Jack Straw got his 'three strikes and you're out' automatic minimum sentences from the States. Labour politicians have bought US policy like trans-atlantic shoppers stockpiling tights from Bloomingdales.  But the sprees for fresh ideas are less rewarding now, and when a good one does emerge, notably Bob Kiley's Tube plan, the Chancellor insists, perversely, on a botched alternative. Copying is fine, but we need new, European icons. Germany demonstrates why proper status for teachers is the only answer to our schools crisis. France shows what a better health service can do. Holland suggests the wisdom, stubbornly rejected by us, of vaccinating against a foot-and-mouth epidemic. Our railways crumble, tourism slumps and even the body-piercing industry has been dealt a nasty blow by Posh. We are forced to import our teachers and export our sick.  When we need new ideas so fast, the only answer is to abandon we-know-best smugness and beef up our copycat culture. The time has come for kleptomania."
4,"Marriage is dead. Again. Secularism and overwork may have made it squirm, but the fatal blow comes from a footballer's wife. Karen Parlour's divorce settlement will, in the view of gloomy pundits, mean the end of matrimony, at least for the loaded. Ms Parlour, an unconventional member of her caste, is not a shopping locust stripping bare the racks of Versace. Her habitat is Romford High Street, her luxury is getting her nails done for £26 and her mum comes round to do the cleaning.  Despite her homely credentials, Ms Parlour has terrified rich men, who will allegedly now be staying single or relying on pre-nuptial agreements drafted along the lines and length of the European Communities (Finance) Act. The panic follows the appeal court's decision to award Ms Parlour, who already has two homes worth £1 million, the sum of £440,000 a year, with the requirement that she should save an annual £294,000 as a nest egg. No wonder footballers fearful of claims on their future earnings are trembling over their Krug, or Highland Spring in the case of the abstemious Mr Parlour.   Ex-wives have not, however, established a claim to 50 per cent of future income or to indefinite maintenance. The Parlour settlement, subject to revision in four years, allows for a clean break. But, if the ruling is not all bad for men, then neither is it as good as it looks for women. Once again, the notion is implanted that divorcing wives are cashing in, when the reverse is true. Three-quarters of single mothers live on less than £299 a week, before housing costs, compared with 16 per cent of couples.   The Parlour judgment has nothing to do, though, with ordinary people. It deals instead with those who are rolling in surplus lucre. Obviously, Ms Parlour should be treated fairly, but it seems odd that there is no question of her getting a job, as other single mothers are always being urged to.   There is no need for her to return to her previous occupation, as an optician's assistant. Specsavers would be too mundane for a woman capable of saving English football. If she were to set herself up as a lifestyle coach, managers would flock to seek the wisdom that weaned Ray off drink and loutishness and persuaded Lord Justice Thorpe that she deserved her money.   If Ms Parlour's methods were replicated, the Priory would close for lack of business, Chinawhite's would serve beetroot juice, tracts of arable England would be given over to cultivating rocket for salads, and dubious women trawling foreign hotels to prey on legless soccer stars would have to take up cribbage.   Even if you acknowledge her reformist genius, there is something arcane in a ruling that rewarded Ms Parlour, explicitly, for good wifeliness. If she had been a loving mother who left it to a strict manager, Arsne Wenger, to discipline her husband, would she have been given less? What if she had been more independent? If the Beckham marriage ever shudders to a halt, the appeal court's logic suggests that Posh will be awarded fourpence and instructed by some kindly judge to be sure and save it for a rainy day.   The Parlour case, an illustration of what happens when imploded love meets the precision of the law, is a prelude to another messy showdown. The argument about who gets the money is over and we are moving on to who gets the kids. The government, having dusted the flour-bombers' purple residue off its lapels, hopes to launch a green paper on relationship breakdown before the summer recess, while the Tories, equally mindful of furious fathers, are holding their family summit tomorrow.   Michael Howard will be saying that 'the best parents are both parents'. That truism, with its implicit nod towards crusading dads, echoes the views of campaigners elsewhere. In Wisconsin, advocates of 'equal shares parenting' say that a 50/50 split of marital property has reduced to almost zero the 80 per cent of divorces that went to court. Split children in two by law and the same result will follow.   Here, Bob Geldof has argued for the presumption that youngsters will live with the father 50 per cent of the time. Mr Howard should be wary. Fathers often get an unfair deal, but the Geldof view is a charter for the selfish. Time-share children must have a ruling say in their own future. To most parents, it is obvious that friendships, routines and habits do not fit a legal straitjacket, and that children, conscious of adult jealousies, are willing to endure misery rather than causing any pain.   Such unhappiness risks being disregarded, as pro-father feelings begin to echo through the courts. When a senior family judge urged earlier this year that mothers who defy access orders should be jailed, he was articulating a more general drift towards compulsion.   In a major study to be published soon, Professor Carol Smart, of Leeds University, revisited 60 children of divorced parents who shared their care. Some young teenagers had been unhappy for years. One boy said his father barricaded him in the house and that he was desperate to run away.   The happy children interviewed by Smart were invariably those whose parents sought their views and let them be flexible. Rigid arrangements for young people growing into adolescence could cause grave problems, she concludes.   So what should fathers do? It is heartbreaking for men who have been involved more closely than any other generation with their children suddenly to be sidelined or excluded. But the answer, as the green paper will say, does not lie in edict. If the one in 10 divorcing couples in serious dispute cannot reach agreement, in private or with outside help, then the courts will rarely ordain peace for them or secure a good life for their children.   The government will be hazy on what can be done. Information and conciliation are not great buzzwords for despairing fathers. But at least the green paper may acknowledge that children should not be parcelled out on adult whim and that their best interests, unfiltered through an adult prism, will be the guiding principle. With luck, there will be no mention of equal shares.   In the divorce courts, an even split is a necessary illusion. Because it is impossible to weigh up the value of Ms Parlour's anti-drinking homilies against her husband's ability to take a penalty, the appeal court has ascribed a similar value to both. Since Mr Parlour is rich, the case sidesteps the misery that follows when dependent women, and men, ruin their former partners' lives by avarice. The Parlour result, in short, has no great consequences, unless soccer stars start suing their wives for failing to stop them trashing nightclubs.   The real danger is that equality and fairness, the twin mantras of divorce law, risk being applied too rigidly to the offspring as well as the chattels of a marriage. A Shylock strategy of carving up children with no blood spilt would be a disastrous way of demonstrating that equality is often very far from fair."
4,"Kitchen table terror is not new. The Wood Green 'ricin' larder, stocked with lethal ingredients, such as cherry stones and apple pips, brings back memories of Auntie Annie's 'bomb factory' at the height of the IRA's mainland assault. Annie Maguire, a court was told, taught her small children how to mix up nitroglycerine for the paramilitaries in her Kilburn parlour. Under prosecution questioning about what bombs looked like, her son, Patrick, drew on his knowledge of the  Beano  and described a 'long black ball with a wire coming out of it'.  The fantasy was enough. Mrs Maguire, a monster for a fearful nation, was jailed for many years. Two of her sons were also locked up and her younger children farmed out. Of those sentenced with her, her brother-in-law, Giuseppe Conlon, died in prison, of emphysema and despair, with an inmates' chorus of 'What shall we do with the fucking bombers?' in his ears.  More than a quarter of a century later, in February this year, Tony Blair apologised publicly to the Maguire seven for one of the gravest miscarriages of justice of the last century. There was no bomb factory and no plot. Annie Maguire and her family had long since been declared innocent. They deserved, the Prime Minister said, to be 'completely and publicly exonerated.'  By then, another war on terror was in train. Other suspects had supposedly been bottling death like marmalade, and the long trial of Kamel Bourgass and his alleged co-chefs was nearing its end. Last week, Bourgass was convicted of conspiring to cause a public nuisance.   Four others were cleared and a second trial of four more men abandoned.  There was no ricin and no al-Qaeda recipe, only a formula apparently confected by a white American Christian survivalist and downloaded from the internet. Even if Bourgass, a nasty and deluded loner, had managed to create his poison and smear it on car-door handles, it would not have worked. Had Bourgass the poisoner devoted himself to creating the perfect Nigella chickpea couscous, he could hardly have been a less likely mass exterminator.  But he had another persona. Bourgass the murderer, a failed asylum seeker, knifed Stephen Oake to death when the police came looking for him. The killing of a brave officer shifted the story into the arms of Michael Howard, who flouted the compassion of DC Oake's widow and attacked the 'chaos' of the asylum system.  Labour is unlikely to have minded this switch of focus. The annual number of asylum applicants, now 34,000, has almost halved since Bourgass applied, and the backlog of cases has been sliced from 50,000 to 10,000 in a decade. Electronic fingerprinting and e-borders make police better able to find people who change identity, as he did, and monitor who is entering and leaving the country.  There is evidence, too, that Mr Howard's own-brand fear factory is driving voters towards Labour. Last of all, the Home Secretary has seized the chance to promote ID cards, even though they would have made not a shred of difference in the Bourgass case. The Tories' insidious opportunism on asylum and immigration should not disguise that the government also cashed in on bogus ricin, disseminating panic with an efficiency of which Bourgass could only dream.   In the absence of chemical poison, a war against Iraq, a fake link between al-Qaeda and Saddam and a double helping of contempt of court were brewed up on Kamel Bourgass's hob. Tony Blair, David Blunkett, Colin Powell and senior police officers all used the arrests to illustrate the existence of a new breed of Islamist super-terrorist. A criminal prosecution was exploited to fit a political agenda. A war was justified and civil liberties imperilled by the ricin stash that never was.  The case is over, but old myths die hard. In the age of the precautionary principle and Donald Rumsfeld's unknown unknowns, reality gets so sparse that even the most blatant lies acquire substance.  The day after the case ended, London's  Evening Standard was barmily talking up 'a new terror fear over lost poison' on the basis of a police claim that an al-Qaeda cell could have the 'missing ricin'. But even if a quantity of poison existed, which it did not, it would have harmlessly degraded long ago. Fear and prejudice have a longer half-life. Once manufactured, they are almost impossible to unmake.  Right-wing conflation of asylum and terror will be difficult to unknot. Lawyers for the eight cleared men are outraged at the way their clients have been portrayed by the media and politicians, and there is so little acknowledgment of a just result, from the Home Office and elsewhere, that one wonders if dodgy convictions would have left some politicians more satisfied. Meanwhile, a new terror law, more draconian than expected, is in the Labour manifesto, pushing criminal trials for those who 'glorify or condone acts of terror'.  The hunger for something new eclipses the fact that all necessary means were in place to stop Bourgass, who slipped through the immigration net   after a shoplifting conviction because no official was available to interview him and whose murder of DC Oake followed some questionable operational decisions by Greater Manchester police.  Bourgass will, probably and rightly, spend the bulk of his life in jail. But, as our leaders have not said, it was also proper that those charged with him were cleared. None was vindicated because terror prosecutions are too difficult or evidence inadmissible. They were supposedly caught in the kitchen with their fingers in the ricin pot. Nothing could be more damning, except that it wasn't true.  A panel of their peers devoted many weeks to assessing the evidence and discovered that there was none. The result was a tribute to beleaguered juries and a vindication of a justice system that politicians often deem too arcane, or too wilful, for an age of nameless fears and elusive proof.  The affair of the sham ricin casts a long shadow over the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the credulous sensationalists of the media and, most of all, over politicians. Last week was a good one for the rule of law, but the sullen reaction to the outcome also highlights a dangerous disregard for justice.  Eight innocent men were presumed guilty. Ten others held for two years without charge reportedly had non-existent links to the ricin plot cited on their government control orders. Sanctions get harsher and the borderline grows fainter between fair trials and wild allegation garbed in flimsy intelligence and sanctified as truth. All the lessons of what could happen next lie in our recent past.  Justice tailored to a time of terror, real or perceived, is the shortcut back to the world in which Annie Maguire was torn from the dock, kicking and hysterical, to begin her 14-year-sentence. 'I'm innocent, you bastards,' she cried. 'No, no, no.' But this was Salem. So the door slammed on her screaming and almost no one thought she might be right."
4,"At 8.46 eastern time four years ago today, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Centre in New York City. Many hundreds died in that instant. The emergency services' response began within five seconds.At 4pm Central Time two weeks ago today, the US national weather service warned that the hurricane about to hit New Orleans would cause 'human suffering incredible by modern standards'. The following morning, as citizens drowned on their front porches, President George W Bush attended a cake-cutting photo-opportunity to mark Senator John McCain's 69th birthday.And now another anniversary rolls around. On 11 September 2001, the world reached out to a stricken America, unaware that US helplessness was a brief prelude to an era of power run mad. From Manhattan to Mesopotamia to the Mississippi, we have come full circle. Hurricane Katrina has turned a superpower into a victim again.Only this time, few rally to the President. Rotting bodies lie like rubbish sacks in the streets of New Orleans, 42 per cent of Americans think Bush has done a 'bad' or 'terrible' job, and the world looks at his catastrophe management in horror and derision.Blaming Bush is easy. That is not to say it is wrong. It would have been better if scientists' warnings had been heeded and the levees strengthened. It would have been preferable if America had not housed its poorest below the Plimsoll line of civilisation, and if the emergency controller, now sidelined, had not been a klutz called 'Brownie' who used to run gymkhanas. Ideally, the President would learn to prioritise national disasters and birthday parties.But the hurricane is not about one scapegoat, however powerful, nor is it just a fable of America. Britons may be shocked that obese inhabitants of the richest nation can be victims of starvation too. They may be startled that many New Orleans citizens are poor black people who might shoot and loot and who have never set foot in the French quarter, with its filigree balconies, jazz clubs and a population that is 95 per cent white. But Britain, with its own gaping social divide, has no excuse for smugness.The universal lesson of Katrina is broader, though, than inequality. Timothy Garton Ash argues that we have witnessed how, with the removal of the staples of civilised life, such as water and personal security, people revert to a 'Hobbesian state of nature, a war of all against all'. At the hint of a dirty bomb or some other apocalyptic onslaught, societies could become 'decivilised'.This is a very gloomy creed. It is true that, in extremis, hungry flood victims are rarely to be mistaken for Jane Austen heroines. You will not find them sitting around debating whether Hobbes's gospel of state control was more relevant than the benign anarchy outlined by Proudhon, who thought that 'property was theft'. They will get down to Wal-Mart and grab some food and drink, if necessary at rifle point. Such action may or may not seem more despicable than the online looting of white-collar barbarians now setting up bogus flood relief appeals.The Lord of the Flies scenario is, by definition, nothing new. The Greeks coined the word 'barbaros' for anyone who did not speak their language. To Marx, barbarism was a synonym for capitalist destruction, a theme embroidered by Osama bin Laden's favourite writer, Sayyid Qutb, who used the term jahiliyya to label the West a materialist hell meriting attack. And so to 9/11 and a new chapter in barbaric action. The timeline linking September 2001 to today is studded with the headstones of its antagonists and martyrs.They include as many as 27,000 Iraqi citizens; the 2,000 dead US and British soldiers; the massacred of Bali and Istanbul, Riyadh, Madrid, Casablanca, London. There are the individuals whose histories dominated the narrative for a while; Margaret Hassan, Kenneth Bigley, David Kelly: the aid worker, the contractor, the government inspector.Western pugilism cannot justify the outrages of jihadism. But few, bar the US President and the British Prime Minister, would seriously argue that an unlawful Iraq war, fought against world opinion, has not fomented terrorism and laid innocent people everywhere open to attack and peril. North Korea has the bomb and Iran may not be far behind. Bush, and now Blair, have defied international rules to welcome India to their nuclear club.If the people who strolled to work in the Twin Towers on a cloudless September morning could see the blood that saturates their graves, they would be incredulous. Many would also be appalled, not only by fanatics who want to rewind the world to a 7th-century caliphate but by the forward planners of the West.On decivilisation, we do not have much to learn from a few hungry looters. Those interested in the seeds of savagery should look elsewhere. The destitute driven to anarchy are simply victims. Those who commit grave crimes under the cover of disaster deserve punishment by the law, but even they do not undermine civilisation in the same way as people who wear suits, kiss babies and sign the orders that enable, though never command, the outrages at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and Camp Breadbasket. Crowds may look menacing, but the powerful are much better at torture and havoc than the weak.For Americans, and all other nations, today is the anniversary of year zero. The resurgence of religion in a world reforged four years ago meshed with Bush's war of good versus evil; of right-wing Christendom versus radical Islam. The Lord's carelessness in allowing 9/11 to happen might deepen hardline faith, but that was murder in the second degree. His callousness in unleashing an act of God has shaken Bible Belt America to its pious roots.That doubt may do some good, if a side-effect of Katrina is to downplay the hand of the Almighty in US politics. Already Bush is proving much less eager than many feared to cram the Supreme Court with anti-abortion zealots. His country might learn to love the gun a little less and the poor a little more. There are more lessons, as relevant for Britain as for America.The solidarity instilled by 9/11 made electorates too credulous. Even the most vehement opponents of invading Iraq were shocked to discover that the evidence for Saddam's weapons of mass destruction was no more than the fantasy of leaders spoiling for a war.There will be other crusades. Bush still menaces Iran. Blair talks of justice and human rights as if they are the shield and armoury of jihadis, rather than the pillars of civilisation. The discarded dead of New Orleans offer another story: of social division, craven politicians and incompetent public servants.But, most of all, the disaster has been a reminder to all who hold the powerful to account. Tragedy once conferred upon our leaders a wisdom they did not possess and a trust they did not merit. Never again."
4,"Justice, like evil, has a banal face. The dock to which Saddam Hussein was brought sat in one of those familiar blond-wood courtrooms which feature on television whenever American celebrities or British au-pairs face the might of the US judicial process. If the set looked borrowed from LAPD Blues, then the detail belonged to the sort of magistrates' bench rendered comatose by offences involving absent tax discs. In particular, the announcement that Saddam's defence team is to be boosted by a 'neighbour dispute expert from Devon' gives the impression that some hotshot on tiffs involving leylandii hedging is being dispatched to help the world's most antisocial neighbour from hell.  Saddam himself looked diminished, as all captured tyrants do, especially those delivered to their day of reckoning not by Group 4 minders but in shackles. Newspapers called him shabby or haggard, but he didn't look too bad, in a white shirt worn over worked-out pectorals. The orthodontist called in, post-spider hole, for some televised emergency flossing, seemed to have done a good job. Nothing in this tableau of groundbreaking justice leapt out to frighten the spectators. Onlookers could sleep well, as they always tell you to when the credits roll on  Crimewatch .  But, obviously, there are many questions to disturb not only Iraqis whose lives Saddam wrenched apart but also the British liberal conscience. Many think the process begun last week is a blatant example of US stagecraft. Salem Chalabi, the tribunal head and nephew of one of the most vocal (and unsavoury) Saddam opponents, is not a name to conjure impartiality. Nor does the sidelining of lawyers for the accused, and the exclusion of most Iraqi journalists, augur well for a process that may culminate in a hastily resurrected death penalty.  Much of the anxiety is justified, but not all. The statute under which Saddam stands trial bears the name of Paul Bremer, the departed US proconsul, but its drafters were a battery of international human rights lawyers. The charge sheet, though generic in content and silent about the war against Iran, when America tacitly backed Saddam, is clearly framed. Procedures for including independent prosecutors and judges are in place, as are provisions for a fair process.  So far, so good. Those who see the Hague as the better way must also acknowledge the longueurs of the Milosevic trial. The initial judge is dead. The defendant begins his account tomorrow. This may be scrupulous justice, but such crawler-lane catharsis offers, at best, the scenic route to reconciliation. Some experts, including Peter Carter, chair of the Bar Council's human rights committee, much prefer the Baghdad model.  But Carter rightly worries that the US risks ruining everything. The interference so far has been, in his view, 'unforgivable'. Film from the courtroom went out silenced. Arab television stations were excluded, and the tapes of the court proceedings on CNN were marked 'Cleared by US Military'. Reports of disgraceful acts of censorship, destroyed video tapes of Saddam with a chain around his waist and other deletions not only blight justice, they also suggest to many Iraqis that, in a process manipulated by a hated occupier, some of the horrors perpetrated by the defendant may be cooked up, too.  On the face of it, the proof of Saddam's crimes is everywhere, but evidence is flimsy stuff. Command responsibility, blurred in the Milosevic trial, may be easier to ascribe to Saddam the arch-controller. Even so, the occupation forces have already allowed some of the paper trail to be shredded. Witnesses may never divulge their testimonies if fear or intimidation ordain their silence. Some Iraqis   argue that basic security is more important than bringing a dictator to trial, but justice is not a matter of ticking one box or another. The success of the process against the great dictator depends on whether the invisible legions he persecuted feel safe to tell their stories.  As the long legal process begins, the coalition also has a case to answer. It is not good enough for George Bush to pretend that last week's stage-managed display of freedom reigning is Iraqi justice for Iraqis. The signs are it could be nothing of the kind. It is indefensible, too, for the government to suggest that we shall have to condone the death penalty, if that is the course chosen by a sovereign Iraq. A country pledged never to return citizens to regimes where they might be executed cannot, because expediency or obeisance to the US demands it, suddenly decide there is a corner of the world where it is fine for the state to kill people. Such a view, shaming to this government, would also demean the new Iraq.  Perhaps Iraq will look to its history. In 1963, five years after the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy, rebels executed Brigadier Qassim, the country's 'Sole Leader'. As his bullet-riddled corpse was paraded on Iraqi television, the Baath Party moved towards power, and the scene was set for a new saviour.  Saddam, rumoured to have extracted a bullet from his leg with a razor blade before swimming the Euphrates and fleeing to Syria, was already a legend-in-waiting.  Now, in his disgrace, he retains one hope of potency. The power of pity is available even to monsters, if they are seen to be suitably ill-treated by their captors. Saddam clanking in chains is a more persuasive figure, for all his viciousness, than a tyrant offered the protective panoply of the law. But what, exactly, is that?  It is assumed, patronisingly, that the Iraqi model of justice is some tinpot effort of questionable legitimacy, propped up by the exemplary jurisdictions of the West. But recent lessons, from Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib, show how shoddy and rough their justice can be. In England and Wales, picking senior judges is so biased that, according to a report last week, appointments should be suspended.  Though good at exporting justice and giving places such as Trinidad and Jamaica fine, written constitutions, we retain, for domestic use, a constitutional shambles and a Human Rights Act that Peter Carter calls 'wimpish'.  If Iraq and those who saw their loved ones die are to have their reconciliation, it will not be signed in a tyrant's blood or delivered by Western hypocrisies. Violence is rarely assuaged by more of the same. The cycle of hatred brought no peace in Northern Ireland and it will bring none in Iraq.  The Saddam trial may promise an end to division and a better future. It may help cement the rule of law that is the cornerstone of all democracies. But if the former occupiers censor and interfere, the process could instead symbolise the collapse of justice that disfigures citizens' lives in this and all other centuries.  The image lingers of a prisoner with a bad beard, a murderous reign and a fantasy of being King Lear. Saddam is not the only defendant. In the years to come, the conduct of those who ended his tyranny will also be on trial."
4,"The BBC has just concluded an inspiring series on the pioneering work of Kypros Nicolaides. His struggle to save the lives of unborn babies at King's College Hospital reflected the world-beating empathy, resource and skill on offer through the NHS, albeit in limited doses. As  Life Before Birth finished, another dramatic primetime documentary unfolded at a second London hospital.  Though the plotlines could not have been more dissimilar, Professor Nicolaides's base at King's College is not so different to A&amp;E at the Whittington, where Rose Addis was treated. In both departments, the scruffy interiors are less evocative of Nicky Haslam than Iris Murdoch. Neither is well-supplied with back copies of  Tatler. There is no sense, in either waiting-area filled with grime-pitted plastic chairs and sticky Lego bricks, that a feng shui consultant has recently passed this way.   The television cameras did not dwell either on shabby corridors or on Nicolaides's private gloom. Once, he told me recently, he went to conferences knowing that British foetal medicine was the best in Europe. 'Now I talk about the rate of death in premature babies, and people from so-called underdeveloped countries raise their eyebrows at our low standards compared to theirs,' he said. Morale among NHS staff generally was desperate.   I expect the mood was similar at the Whittington, even before Iain Duncan Smith raised the case of Mrs Addis and her alleged neglect. Since the ensuing pandemonium produced no clear evidence, it is fair to judge the hospital only on its formal record.    One recent study put the Whittington in Britain's top 40 trusts. The Government's commission for health improvements said last week that most aspects were fine but that patients had to wait too long in casualty.   The real problem is evident to any visitor. You can calibrate it in lack of staff, or queuing time, or the ratio of Hampstead liberals to Holloway drunks, but the bottom line is poverty, as endemic in the patients as in the system.   Even so, the Whittington is less awful than last week's insults suggest. King's College, for all its specialist brilliance, is more beleaguered than the flattery of the cameras implies. Two hospitals; two shifting perspectives. Why is the NHS always so misunderstood? Set aside the furore of the Addis case, with its baggage of blood-stained socks, unchanged clothes, tardy family visitors and (hastily-dropped) racism charges. The facts hardly matter, not least because there aren't many.   The real issue is why most NHS debate has become unhinged from reason. No other country behaves so emotionally, or hysterically, about healthcare. Dutch and Italian patients must blink at the rapturous hymns delivered by incapacitated British tourists who end up in their hospitals. We ship our sick off on Eurostar for operations, convinced that Lille is the new Lourdes. The French system, often touted as a model institution, is actually riven by industrial battles over pay and hours. But when GPs went on strike again last week, there was no national panic or battalions of prescription-starved grandmas storming the Elyse Palace.   While health is not to be compared with the services offered by glaziers or gasmen, attitudes to the NHS stray far beyond mere issues of life and death into the sentimental swampland of politics. To both main parties, the health service, replete with heroes and villains, is Victorian melodrama on an heroic scale. In the latest production of Temptation Sordid Or Virtue Rewarded, Duncan Smith used his odious Commons attack to smear the Whittington staff.   But Alan Milburn has also cast health professionals as villainous Sir Jaspers. Although now all public servants are Mr Blair's social entrepreneurs, I do not remember Mr Milburn offering much comfort to can-do innovators who moved bodies into an overspill hospital morgue in Bedford. Both in that confected scandal and the Alder Hey organs dbcle, ministerial interventions inflamed fury.   In an arena where cool logic should inform good stewardship, health policy looks too random and events-driven. Like rotas for cricket teas and church-hall rummage sales, it also owes a disproportionate debt to elderly women. Mr Blair's first pledge of parity with Europe and much more money was accelerated by the stories of the cancer patient, Mavis Skeet, and by Lord Winston's attack, fuelled by the treatment his sick mother had received. Now there is Mrs Addis.   Sandwiched between those events is a confetti of initiatives. Billions of pounds have been almost tracelessly absorbed into the parched terrain of the NHS. Yet ironically, just before the Whittington case, the Government might have thought it could relax. The Bristol heart deaths affair was finally over. There was, as yet, no winter beds crisis; 86 per cent of patients were happy with their treatment. The new NHS modernisation board, a forum for the influential, had just produced a report so optimistic as to be almost unbelievable.   And so it was. By Friday, the news that 5.75 million patients use NHS Direct had mutated into an Audit Commission verdict that the helplines aren't being used by the most needy and that the service is so far adrift of its targets that it is revising the aim of nearly all callers talking to a nurse in five minutes. The new goal time will be 20.   Whatever the merits of the modernisation board, the new president of the Royal College of Surgeons prefers, in an unusual gesture of independence, not to sit on it. Sir Peter Morris believes that such a role might compromise his ability to say what he believes to be true, namely, that hospitals are in a much worse mess than he would have believed possible.   But despite government spin and professional gloom, there is good news too. Labour has abandoned the myth that the NHS can ever flourish without tax rises. It now looks possible that the upper limit on National Insurance will be removed. Mr Duncan Smith thinks, conversely, that tax cuts can be combined with a better NHS. That difference explains, more cogently than any hissy fit over individuals' treatment, why Labour may create an excellent health service, why the Tories never will, and why Mr Blair therefore holds all the cards.   He should now deal a few out and see that salvation cannot be achieved while government goes into synchronised spasm at every twitch of a cubicle curtain in the Whittington Hospital or elsewhere.   The King's Fund last week recommended, rightly, that local health providers should be autonomous. This is very different from the conditional freedom Mr Milburn is offering to the tractable and obedient. More radically, the King's Fund wants a corporation, similar to the BBC, to run the health service, leaving government only to raise money and do broad-brush strategy. Sir Peter Morris has also called for the service to be severed from political diktat.   Handing the NHS over to faceless administrators strikes Ministers as crazy. They are wrong. Separation of powers is the obvious and perhaps the only way forward. What the King's Fund and Sir Peter are saying, more or less politely, has been perfectly illustrated by the histrionics of the past week. Governments, even well-intentioned ones, are not fit to run the health service."
4,"Be very afraid. The Home Secretary implies the streets are dangerous. Liza Minnelli almost gets mugged on her latest honeymoon. A pigtailed yob of 11 may be hurling breeze blocks through the window of a shop near you. Three thousands offenders currently enduring Her Majesty's oversubscribed hospitality will soon be out, tagged but supposedly casting lascivious glances at the Volvos and Vodafones of a nation on high alert. Few, give or take the lowland fox, can think themselves protected now. In Wimbledon, some rich women barely venture out, for fear of being carjacked on their way to a lettuce lunch. In Primrose Hill, a security firm offers UN-style protection to citizens unloading groceries from people-carriers. In an ICM poll, Labour's lead falls from 17 points to nine because voters are terrified of street crime.  But the economy prospers, retail sales are up 1.5 per cent and the daffodils are out. Despite Quatermass politics and newspaper hysteria, the streets feel as safe as they always did. They are. In 1981, Britons had a one in 200 chance of being attacked by a stranger. The same statistic applies today. Under the red tape theorem, the more pen-pushing police officers you have, the higher the number of recorded crimes. The British Crime Survey, a more trusted measure, says that overall crime fell by a third between 1995 and 2000 and that violent offences dropped by a fifth in the final year of the last century.  The subsequent rise in street crime is mainly due to mobile phone thefts.   Phone-snatching is not, as some suggest, a playground craze, like hopscotch with menaces, but neither is it evidence of civil meltdown. There is no shortage of grim areas and tragedy; a 15-year-old boy is stabbed to death; a woman of 82 is robbed for the fourth time in as many years. But random crimes, however brutal, offer little evidence for notions that most law-abiding citizens are holed up in Mugabe Mansions with drug-crazed psychopaths baying at the gates.  So what's going on? David Blunkett wants serious money from Gordon Brown and offers some grim tableaux to make his case. That bullishness is only part of it. Lurid press stories of kids from hell have not helped Mr Blunkett. On the contrary, public unease may have prompted his summons, with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, to Downing Street. Mr Blair offered support but will also have demanded some solutions.  The Prime Minister favours 'eye-catching initiatives'. His wish-list is, however, unlikely to include the spectacle of more public sparring between Mr Blunkett and Sir John Stevens, who share a desire that no crisis should ever knowingly be undersold. Dramas breed fear and Mr Blunkett risks becoming the victim of a muddled and febrile mood his high profile has helped engender. In January, he sought to damp down public anxiety, announcing that the chances of becoming a crime victim were the lowest in 20 years. Last week, he warned that we must 'reclaim the streets'.  The mantra is one of toughness, but jails are full and prisoners will be released early. Marching yobs to cashpoints, one of Mr Blair's less felicitous eye-catchers, is back on the agenda in amended form. And the Home Secretary professes 'bewilderment at the debate going on'. Mr Blunkett's not the only one. Nor is he, a Minister who has done some fine things (and a few appalling ones), a prime culprit. He is simply part of a modern jigsaw of confusion. Hierarchies of trust were never reliable, but now few gold standards, or even bog standards, of impartiality, consistency and objective assessment exist in public life. Lord Woolf, the great rehabilitator, demands that young, mobile phone robbers are jailed. Reports linking the Chancellor's mission to rescue the NHS with his baby daughter's death hint that private tragedy informs public policy. The suggestion may be preposterous, but a doubt is sown.  Geoff Hoon says he is 'absolutely confident' that, in the right conditions, Britain would be willing to use nuclear weapons against Iraq or any other rogue state. Suddenly, Mr Hoon, a Minister to whom one would hesitate to entrust a peashooter, is a master of the embattled universe, brandishing nukes against Saddam and dispatching 1,700 troops to fight the guerrillas of al-Qaeda.  To wonder whether the Defence Secretary has a clue about what he is doing does not imply the slightest disrespect. In the war against terror, publicity swamps insight at all levels. When few have any knowledge and everyone has an agenda, the capacity for disinformation is spectacular. President Bush has exploited it to the full. After months of propaganda, bin Laden remains at large, Mullah Omar is presumably pedalling the cycle lanes of Gardez and no one can explain exactly what mission confronts outgoing British troops.  Last week, American defence chiefs announced compelling evidence that al-Qaeda had bases in Somalia. A day later, they retracted that proof as bogus. How lucky for Somali civilians that someone noticed one error in a catalogue of assertions too vague to satisfy the modern consumer in any sphere but war. You wouldn't buy a mail-  order sweatshirt on the data provided by the CIA, let alone a possible second Vietnam.  The less verifiable the truth, the more febrile the unrest. In Salem in 1692, old scores got settled 'on a plane of heavenly combat between Lucifer and the Lord'. Once again, it's fine to 'cry witch against one's neighbour', whether the target of suspicion hails from Yemen or Yarmouth. In war, as in crime, terror takes over when truth gets malleable. A quarter of women fear sexual assault, but only 0.078 per cent of victims report such an attack. One in five adults worries that his car will be stolen, when the chances are 1.5 in 100. The perception is that criminals walk free when, as Nacro's figures show, many more are being jailed.  Mr Blunkett's tagging initiative may actually drive up the prison population. Crime scares always do. With equal certainty, quiet voices are barely heard. The Prison Reform Trust's new report, Barred Citizens, makes the case for better rehabilitation. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary warns that there is a dearth of analysis of 'what works and why'. Interest in allegations linking Commander Brian Paddick to gay sex on the Gatwick Express far exceeds calls to extend his successful drugs strategy for Lambeth. Car alarms and phone disablers stop crime, but dull measures don't get talked about.  Roll up instead for a ghost train ride of cheap thrills. It is easier to turn a child vandal into a media superstar than to ask what sort of a society produces, or gawps at, an 11-year-old girl who breaks up shops for fun. Or what kind of people are more interested in demonising 'evil' children than in devising a system to help stop three in four young offenders being reconvicted within two years of release. If society, in keeping with the hot moral rhetoric of the age, treats the young, the victimised and the deprived as beyond redemption, that is how they will emerge. And then it will be time to be afraid."
4,"A crowd of 200 had gathered to watch the prisoner arrive. Mothers and fathers with pushchairs and small children in tow, screamed 'Scum', and 'Die' and 'Kill the bastard'. A man built like a Charolais and dressed in sweatshirt and trainers hurled himself at the silver police people-carrier bearing Roy Whiting, a 42-year-old mechanic, to Chichester Magistrates Court, where he was remanded in custody last Wednesday, charged with the kidnap and murder of Sarah Payne.  The fury of the mob had been stoked at first by horror at the killing of an eight-year-old and by the News Of The World 's subsequent name-and-shame campaign. More recently the police, if not whipping up hysteria, have, seemingly, done little to tamp it down. A week ago, detectives helpfully tipped off the press that they planned to charge Whiting, who had been arrested and questioned twice previously, within three days. It was believed, though not confirmed, that their breakthrough hinged on an appeal by the BBC's Crimewatch programme.   As a 'senior police source' told the Daily Mail: 'The incident room has not stopped working since the day little Sarah disappeared. The man is due to be arrested... and the mood among many officers is buoyant.' If true, this revelation of police hubris is a disgraceful affront to justice.  Roy Whiting is innocent in the eyes of the law. He has entered no plea and faced no jury. Once a quaint old protocol decreed that, at the whiff of an arrest, a veil of secrecy descended. Now, it seems, practically anything goes in high-profile murder cases, where tragedy elides with show business and the public clamours for results.  Can Whiting get a fair trial, given the weight and type of publicity surrounding Sarah's murder? Among other examples of goldfish-bowl defendants, the next in line is Barry George, a prime focus of the media spotlight, who goes on trial for Jill Dando's murder in a fortnight.   One can see why three Appeal Court judges resisted the argument that Michael Stone should not have his case tested again in court because, as his barrister claimed, 'the wealth of prejudicial material... would make such a retrial unfair'. Perhaps, given the tonnage of pre-publicity surrounding criminal cases, the best to be hoped for is an amnesiac jury.  Later this week, the judges will give their reasons for ordering a retrial following their decision to quash Stone's conviction for the murders of Lin Russell and her daughter, Megan, and the attempted murder of Josie Russell, after a key witness had been shown to be unreliable.   The Russells will have to revisit their tragedy. Kent police may, in due course, have some tough questions to answer as to why justice miscarried. For now, the best that can be said of the whole debacle is that the appellate process has been shown to work. Whether Stone is found guilty or innocent, his case was treated with a swiftness denied to others.   Last week Stephen Downing finally walked free, after serving 27 years for the murder of Wendy Howell, a crime he almost certainly did not commit. Disgracefully, he was held in prison long after he would normally have been released, because parole boards refuse to free those who do not admit their guilt.  Last week too, the case of a man hanged for the murder of a cinema manager in 1950 went to appeal after the solicitor for George Kelly's family argued that 'the police and courts believed it was more important to secure a conviction to reassure the public than to properly investigate a crime'.   So what's changed? A quarter of a century after Kelly went to the gallows, the notorious West Midlands Serious Crimes Squad began its regime of torture, bogus confessions and creative note-taking, resulting in a litany of miscarriages of justice. The Birmingham Six were wrongly convicted, and Ann Whelan spent 17 years fighting for the release of her son, Michael Hickey, and watching his life unravel in prison before it finally emerged that he and the two other living members of the Bridgewater Four had been framed by the Squad. How long ago it seems since the wrongful conviction of Judith Ward, Stefan Kiszko, the Maguire Seven, the Guildford Four. How far we have come since then.   But not, perhaps, quite far enough. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is over-loaded with petitioners claiming to have been wrongly sentenced, and the Crown Prosecution Service remains unaccountable, prone to arbitrary decisions and strapped for cash. While science should make convictions watertight, the perception - or the reality - can be quite the opposite. The pattern of invisible blood spots that clinched the case of Sion Jenkins, the teacher found guilty of murdering his step-daughter, Billie-Jo, did not impress a number of powerful advocates who argue that he should never have been convicted. That unease, and the worries raised by the Michael Stone case, don't, of course, denote a return to the corrupt ways of the Seventies.   There are, however, new considerations in an age when locking people up is becoming so simple. Not long ago, Tony Blair announced plans to take DNA samples from everyone arrested in Britain. Fine, except that genes are already being interpreted not only as evi dence of a crime committed but as indicative of one that might be. If genetic profiling becomes part of police investigation, then the presumption of innocence dies. The Law Commission is expected soon, in the light of DNA advances and Sir William Macpherson's recommendations, to relax the 'double jeopardy' principle, under which an acquitted suspect cannot be retried for the same offence. Fine, unless the police and CPS produce slovenly prosecution cases, knowing they can always have another bash.   But the really iniquitous development is the promise by Government of post-election legislation indefinitely to detain people with untreatable personality disorders. Though the real scandal is the dearth of psychiatrists and of hospital beds for the mentally ill, Jack Straw has for years preferred to dream of incarcerating those who have committed no offence but who might. His success, framed in a recent White Paper, may delight those who choose not to recognise that schizophrenics commit 10 murders a year, or about 2 per cent of all killings. We are 20 times more likely to be killed by a sane person than an insane one, but such statistics carry little weight in a hot climate of fear in which we are encouraged to believe that a child-molesting monster lurks at every corner.   In fact, British children are the second safest in the world, according to a new survey by Unicef. But even if they were not, there would be no justification for such a gross affront to human rights. When the weight of the criminal justice system offers no guarantee that we are locking up the right suspects, incarcerating people while skipping the optional extras of a crime and a trial is hardly likely to produce good outcomes. And besides, for those failed by the courts, there is still the prospect of finding justice, even if, in Stephen Downing's case, the quest took most of his life. Jack Straw's and Alan Milburn's detainees, unconvicted but 'untreatable', may have no such luxury."
4,"Thank heavens for Professor Dick van Velzen. When a medical scandal erupts, it is invaluable to have a lightning conductor for public fury, and the professor is the textbook villain. Even better, he is Dutch and therefore subtly distanced from British pathological niceties. His research at Alder Hey hospital was suspect, his collection of human spare parts excessive, and his transparency left much to be desired. On Friday he was temporarily suspended by the General Medical Council, according to its convention of administering a mild knuckle-rap long after every other forum - barring the court of law the professor may still face - has pronounced judgment.  A post-mortem on van Velzen's press clippings offers a grim carve-up of a man depicted as a composite of Burke and Hare, with a dash of Hannibal Lecter and a smattering of Mengele thrown in. Forget Alan Milburn's homily about paternalistic consultants stuck in a 1940s time warp. Van Velzen, as portrayed in the media, more resembles a dodgy doctor of Elizabethan times - a practitioner of sapientia  prisca, the ancient wisdom based on the occult. But the professor, for all his flaws, is hardly a necromancer. Nor has he killed anyone. In hoarding body parts without consent, he was only doing, albeit on a grander scale, what other doctors did.   That does not excuse the pain he caused to relatives. But neither does it quite explain the Health Secretary's demonisation of van Velzen - a symbol of 'gruesome' and 'grotesque' events evoking Gothic tragedy. Perhaps Mr Milburn thought that tremulous horror would play well with an electorate   which is not, by and large, in favour of pickling babies. If so, he miscalculated. His behaviour looked so opportunistic and badly-judged that one wonders how he will cope with the next d&eacute;bcle.   Alder Hey was only the warm-up. Any time now, the Kennedy report into the Bristol children's heart deaths disaster is due to reach Milburn's desk. The largest ever independent investigation into clinical practice in the NHS has already been unaccountably delayed. There is still no word of its progress or its findings, except that Professor Ian Kennedy is likely to discard the lone villains thesis and focus on the broad systems failures linked to James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana. Given Milburn's messianic stance on patient power, you might imagine that he would be desperate to release the Bristol findings. But perhaps not.  The whisper from the royal colleges is that if the Kennedy report is not delivered soon, it may conveniently smoulder in the Ministerial in-tray until after the election, thus sparing Milburn the necessity of confronting the problems of an NHS plunged into deepening gloom.   Doctors, it seems, are the new teachers; members of a profession which once put up with the rigours of the job partly because society esteemed them. These days, cat-stranglers boast a higher status. Beware your amiable GP, lest he turn out to be homicidal or incompetent. Mistrust your surgeon, a vainglorious conflation of the Emperor Napoleon and Sir Lancelot Spratt. Never hand over a scrap of tissue from your dear departed, unless doctors sign a contract elaborate enough to cover the purchase of the Dome. The latest doctor-bashing, as administered by Milburn, was a precise echo of the attack a fortnight ago by Sir Donald Irvine, the GMC president.   According to Irvine, the flawed and secretive culture of the NHS allows 'paternalism' and poor medical practice to go unchallenged. This is a bit rich, given that the GMC is the  dernier cri  in self-protection, obfuscation and dilatory treatment of the miscreants it is supposed to police. Irvine's tirade, designed   to encourage consensus, instead united the British Medical Association and the medical royal colleges in a scornful denunciation. Doctors want the council halved to 50 members, with an executive, weighted towards lay people, of about a dozen. If Irvine cannot oblige, then Milburn should scrap the GMC and think up a better structure, for the sake of patients who must get the 'balance of power' skewed their way.   Milburn is a curious patients' champion, who, so far, has abolished community health councils and installed weaker patients' advocates. The suspicion is that avenues for legitimate complaint are being closed, while patients are being encouraged, rashly, to be as strident as they wish. But, as Alder Hey has proved, patient power is hardly the Delphic oracle. Patients want medical progress but would quite like it to be achieved without the use of dead humans or live animals. They want kidney transplants but recoil at the thought of selling superfluous thymus glands used in anti-rejection research to pharmaceutical companies. Given the poverty of hospitals and the outrageous profits of drugs firms, the only scandal seems to me the nominal price of £10 a sample.   Our odd attitude to morbidity and death is supposedly rooted in the veneration an irreligious society accords to the body rather than the soul, but that cannot be right. Church burials are a model of corporeal respect, whereas secular cremations involve only a conveyor-belt ride through Dralon curtains to the incinerator as the piped Bach plays. It seems more likely that our horror of death is rooted in an age of spurious immortality, where those who swallow their vitamins, do their Pilates, count their   calories and get their Botox jabs may dream of frozen youth and deferred death, if not quite of eternal life.   Hence the absurd fuss about bodies dumped in a hospital chapel and stripped of 'dignity', a commodity that never attaches to the dead and, in hospital, rarely to the living. There is nothing dignified in childbirth or in surgery. I once watched a hip replacement operation, which resembled a cross between  Medea and an Alan Titchmarsh chainsaw demonstration. Riveting, but hardly stately.  Dignity, however, matters to patients, and patients' voices matter to Mr Milburn. As, of course, they should. But where to draw the line? Emboldened by deserved public sympathy, the Alder Hey parents - in an echo of Denise Fergus demanding a say on the punishment of the Bulger killers - clamour, unjustifiably, for court action and mass sackings from an excellent hospital that has saved 1,600 children who would otherwise have died.   In addition, the parents will sue for £10 million compensation. Two rival firms of solicitors vie for rights to this lucrative business. Hospital switchboards are jammed by those who fear their children's organs may lie in some glass jar. A commission is assembled to hand back sad relics whose discovery serves little purpose, beyond eclipsing joyful memories of a living child. Pathologists warn that life-saving operations are already ceasing for lack of donor organs and that medical research will be gravely affected. There are no winners here.   The Bristol report will have to produce a more positive outcome. Threaded through the failings of one hospital will be the wider, unanswered questions - on why there is such a misfit between managers, doctors and regulators, on how over-centralised bureaucracy is stifling the NHS, and on why, in a time of government opulence, doctors profess despair. This time, Milburn will need more than the hot rhetoric of reform. If he gets it wrong, the result may make Professor van Velzen's chamber of horrors look tame."
4,"The on-off British love affair with work is back on. The down-shifters of the Nineties have furtively shifted up again, abandoning wisteria-clad cottages and homemade green bean chutney for Prozac and prestige. The Chancellor propels lone parents towards jobs and declines to abandon his own, even for a few days' paternity leave. Oldies step down reluctantly (Sir Magdi Yacoub) or not at all (Mick Jagger). According to  Management Today, six-day weekers have halved to one in 10. Still, the spectre of workplace tyranny lingers. Nearly everyone wants a job, as long as it's flexible. Patricia Hewitt has been clever in advancing elastic working hours. The edict that employers must, by 2003, consider seriously requests for flexibility by parents of children under six has, predictably, enraged Ruth Lea of the Institute of Directors. Ms Lea can be relied upon, in any work-related drama, for an obliging shake of gory locks and dire hints that women won't get jobs at all if they demand remission for the school nativity play, let alone hours as malleable as Play-Doh. This fury eclipses the fact that industry isn't worried. The Hewitt plan could hardly be more business-friendly.  All parents get is the right to ask, in the same way that Bob Cratchit would, presumably, have been entitled to broach with Ebenezer Scrooge the possibilities of subsidised gym membership, luncheon vouchers and a better work-life balance. Despite offering the possible redress of a tribunal, the Hewitt plan is feeble. It is also a triumph for the Department of Trade and Industry, since business is both the scapegoat and the victor. Meanwhile, government can slither out of the debate we should be having about working parents. Flexible hours, far from being the central issue, are a diversion at best and a fraud at worst.  For a start, they are discriminatory. The more privileged you are, the more flex you get. Cherie Booth is able to be a mother-of-four, promoter of charities, part-time consort to the Prime Minister, sartorial adviser to Afghan women and still find time for a session in the Bharti Vyas Flowtron trousers because of her job, not despite it. If she had been a Tesco check-out operator rather than a leading human rights barrister, she would have been fired long ago.  Wealthy people who really do have long hours can buy flexibility. Domestic service accounts for almost 10 per cent of the workforce, and cleaners, nannies and gardeners combined now exceed the numbers employed in accountancy, water and gas supply or the railways. As an antidote, or an incitement, to presenteeism, City firms will get your sink unblocked, dry cleaning done or dog shampooed, so that leisure time, however brief, can be devoted to lifestyle rather than to messy living.  Ideally, we would all work less and have more say over hours. But, despite horror stories about Gradgrind employers and vindictive non-parents, workers do get some say. In general, the work-life debate is conducted by gloomy protagonists who have a choice over how much they work and earn on behalf of those who don't. For the latter group, flexibility is half-dream, half-euphemism. Mostly, it means part-time. Thirty years after the introduction of the Equal Pay Act, women still earn, on average, four-fifths of men's take-home pay. The big losers are the short-hours women earning 60 per cent of what a man would be getting if he were doing the same job on a full-time basis. Though women full-timers do better, on 80 per   cent of a typical male wage, the gender gap has barely narrowed in the last decade. An effective move towards reducing women's hours without also shortening men's can only reinforce a worse deal for women and for children.  In Tuesday's pre-budget report, we shall start to see how serious Gordon Brown is about abolishing child poverty by 2020 and how the competing claims of deprivation and public services will balance out. Although poor children get sicker, stay poorer and die sooner, they have the grace to do so quietly. Even those condemned to young offender institutions with, according to a new report, a typical reading age of seven, hardly cause a ripple unless they kill themselves or someone else while they are in there. It is impossible to have good schools and hospitals without first tackling poverty and the third of all children condemned to be poor. Their salvation, the Chancellor says, is best secured through jobs.  That path is not smooth, even leaving aside the contradictory stance of a government that shoos single parents out to work but lauds apple-pie notions of traditional families. More practically, an extra 1.5 million jobs may be needed to take one million children out of poverty down the work-based route. For those who are employed, flexible shelf-stacking or filing is unlikely much to enhance the lot of the working poor. It is true that they may be home for fish fingers and supervised homework, but quality time, a vision copyrighted by Middle England, seems much more delectable when viewed from a company boardroom through a mist of guilt.  It is unproven and implausible that children suffer emotionally when both their parents work full time (although such is the hype    that a quarter of all readers of the magazine,  Top Sant, thought, in recent survey, that it was so.) In addition, the great work-life balance argument is chiefly conducted in the absence of those without any work or much of a life to balance. So what are the answers?  First, that mothers (or fathers, if they are the main carer) of small children should never be compelled to work. Second, that securing part-time work, as of right, for new parents is the wrong crusade. Seven out of 10 mothers already go back on reduced hours. The real scandal is that those who want or need to work full time are obliged instead to stay at home or to take low-paid flexitime because the Government has failed to bring in the decent childcare it promised. Still, only one in seven children under eight gets offered a registered place.  The remedy - 10,000 children's centres demanded by the Daycare Trust - would cost an extra £2.5 billion a year, or 5 per cent of education spending, offer means-tested care and allow women to work, full or part-time as they preferred. They would also supply the even start that Europe sees as a birthright and whose lack blights the lives of British children rendered unequal from the start.  The second necessity is to involve men. Although the Hewitt proposals claim to be for them too, everyone knows that few forklift drivers or vice-presidents of Paribas will demand to be home for bathtime, partly through breadwinner stereotyping but also because society has a growing problem with fathers; classified, hopefully, as Mrs Doubtfires (for current partners) or as feckless deserters (in the case of absent ones).  But, violent men apart, bad husbands often make good fathers. Discriminating against them is unfair to children, to whom everyone listens too little, and a block to fair-shares parenting. Part-time equality is not an option. As for flexible working, long hours rarely damage children. Poverty always does."
4,"First ladies are rarely what they seem. When I met Hillary Clinton, I thought we might discuss the political strategy designed to secure her return to Pennsylvania Avenue. Instead, she wanted to talk about how she always puts uneaten olives back in the jar and cling-wraps tiny bits of cheese for another day. 'I find it soothing to potter in a kitchen,' said Mrs Clinton, without the smallest trace of irony. Obviously, conserving cheese rinds is a political act. Our interview was for a women's magazine and Hillary, with a memoir to sell and a senatorial career to build, had spent many years atoning to voters for her claim, at the debut of the Clinton presidency, that she wasn't the sort who 'sat around and baked cookies'. While Clarissa Eden complained that the Suez Canal was flowing through her drawing room, Hillary saw her popularity swept down the waste-disposer on a tide of other women's cake mix.  Though old images are hard to shift, the metamorphosis of Nancy Reagan proves it can be done. Once, she was a shopaholic who spent $209,000 on a new dinner service and who, when asked what she thought of Red China, is supposed to have replied: 'Never on a yellow tablecloth.' Now everyone admires Nancy with a fervour not always extended to her husband.  As middle America traipsed past Ronald Reagan's coffin, obituarists wrangled over who, exactly, they were mourning: a President who taught America to dream again, a pragmatist who hastened the end of the Cold War, or a shambling second-rater who wooed the rich, sowed disdain for government and smoothed the political turf for George W Bush.   There is nothing equivocal about the sanctification of Nancy, the central figure at the state funeral she had choreographed to the last flutter of a Kleenex. Profilers presented almost as endearing foibles the stories of bad parenting, vanity, excess, control freakery, alleged pill-popping and the fact that she could never forgive Raisa Gorbachev for not looking like a hod-carrier.  Maybe Nancy did drive her chef into a frenzy with rehearsals for the banquet in honour of the Prince and Princess of Wales. But perhaps she also detected in Ronnie's toast to 'Prince Charles and Princess Andrew' an early whisper of the dementia that she would have first to hide and then manage in her long role as keeper of the Reagan myth. The families of Alzheimer's sufferers warm to her and so do other ordinary voters. One of America's most reviled first ladies has become the face of caring America and a template for political spouses everywhere.  In the week of Nancy's image makeover, this generation of first wives assembled at Sea Island, Georgia. While the G8 leaders addressed matters of state, such as the Iraq handover, international debt relief and why Jacques Chirac won't do smart casual, Laura Bush was hosting one of those spouses' programmes that typically include a round-table discussion on global women's issues followed by a visit to a mat-weaving co-operative.  No doubt the timetable left Cherie Booth time to reflect on why she was being beaten up, back home, for her eBay purchases of an old alarm clock for Leo and a £15 pair of pink plastic high heels. Not to mention why a survey in Top Sant magazine lumped her in with Victoria Beckham and Jordan as the least popular British role model.  The glorification of Nancy, the baiting of Cherie and the magazine survey are all part of one picture. First wives, popular or not, are the emblem of how societies regard women. Nurturers are approved of, while dissenters such as Blair and Clinton are liable to be torn apart. Some times, the criticism is legitimate. Hillary did not emerge well from the Whitewater scandal, and Mrs Blair's handling of Cheriegate, the saga of her links with the dubious Peter Foster, was appalling.  But who cares if she doesn't realise that top-to-toe cowhide is becoming only on a World of Leather sofa or that white pixie boots are naff? Who is sniping one minute about her extravagance and the next at the cheapskate purchase of a 99p clock? Not men, who couldn't give a damn. The critics are women and, specifically, the sort of women who responded to Top Sant' s survey.  Half are self-confessed social misfits with bad sex lives. Six out of 10 want to give up work, even though 84 per cent believe their talents are unrecognised. The report, hailed solemnly as final proof that women cannot have it all, is actually the lament of addled moaners. These voices are not those of normal working mothers struggling on, in comfort or in poverty. They belong to a nailbar sisterhood of self-repressed loafers who must loathe themselves as much as they profess to dislike Mrs Blair.  High-flying political spouses make such women feel inferior. Invisible first ladies described by Jackie Kennedy as 'moths hanging on the windowpane' instil unease. That leaves self-denying martyrs, or glamorous and good-tempered women like Sandra Howard, in whom Top Sant woman can discern, with only a slight stretch of the imagination, a mirror image of herself.  In less liberated times, there was more freedom for politicians' spouses. Violet Attlee was a Tory and Clementine Churchill a lifelong Liberal. No one had a view on whether or not Audrey Callaghan bought her alarm clocks at H Samuel, while Eleanor Roosevelt's cake-icing skills went unrecorded.  But we are not quite entering a pre-feminist dark age. In America, a new model first lady will play Stepford spouse, but she will also cruise the political talk shows. Laura Bush, the ultimate power doormat, was on CBS soon after Ronald Reagan's death. Her father had died from Alzheimer's, she said. Even so, she rejected Nancy's call to relax restrictions on the stem-cell research that might produce a cure. Mrs Bush was saying what the President dare not.  Nancy Reagan, though steeped in the politics and ideology of the religious right, has taken on a faith lobby opposed to science and careless of humanity. From Hollywood to the Senate, others are backing her campaign. Meanwhile, today's G8 spouses are shaking out their identical pastel trouser suits and reading the disobliging headlines generated in their absence.  Some, like Cherie Blair, get too little sympathy and too little chance to contribute to public debate. Laura Bush, with her mixture of influence and compliance, has no inspiring message to impart. Both, in their different ways, are a symbol of the subordinate role of women in national life.  That leaves the way clear for Saint Nancy. The eulogies paid to a grieving widow may be overdone, but her stem-cell crusade makes her an authentic icon created by the politics of George W Bush. In 21st-century America, the new role model is a woman once notorious for her extravagance, her social climbing and her edicts that the President's appearances must be cancelled because the stars were improperly aligned.  There is something very scary about that."
9,"A Lib Dem MP asked the prime minister yesterday to get the voting age reduced to 16. Matthew Green said at that age young people were thought old enough to marry, to have children, to pay taxes and to join the armed forces. ""Yet they are not allowed to vote until they are 18,"" he expostulated.  Mr Blair, with all the weary wisdom of a man whose house contains several   teenagers, which can be like having a flying saucer full of space aliens living in your home, except that they say less and eat more, said: ""I am not sure that all those things a 16-year-old can do, we'd always want them to do.""   This was thought to be a reference to Euan Blair, who was found face down in Leicester Square at the age of 16, in a pose which suggested he had not spent the previous few hours mulling over his choice of candidate.   In this he resembled several MPs who, at much the same time of night, cannot attribute their fatigue to the fact that they have spent an age working out exactly which way to vote.   It was remarked at the time that Euan Blair's friends   appear to have deserted him.   This is not a problem for members of parliament. Kindly whips will pick them up from the floor, shout in their ears, and if necessary kick them all the way to the correct lobby.   Sometimes they wind up kicking members of the press as well, who are likely to be in a similar condition. (Though of course even while inebriated, we are always sober enough to write a coruscating 500 word denunciation of parents who let their teenage children get drunk in Leicester Square.)   The problem is that MPs themselves are now far too young. Just as one generation cannot remember the war, and a later one has no recollection of the winter of   discontent, so these young shavers have no memory of shroud-waving.   Shroud-waving was a proud tradition during the 1992-1997 Major government, a time which to most MPs seems as distant as the pre-Devonian period. This was nominally to do with the NHS, and was based on the assumption that ministers are personally to blame for every failure of the service, as if, like Roman emperors, they could end or save someone's life with a twitch of the thumb.   ""Is the prime minister aware that my constituent Mr Brown went to the outpatient department for help with an ingrowing toenail, and was found five weeks later, his face a hideous green   and a nest of maggots feasting on his decomposed belly?"" they would inquire.   The prime minister would reply that he would look into this particular case, but that hon members should be aware that the staff of the NHS did a magnificent job in difficult circumstances, and that the other party's plans would lead to a mass extermination which would make the Black Death look like a touch of flu.   Yesterday, Mr Duncan Smith waved the case of 94-year-old Mrs Rose Addis, who, we are told, had to wait days for a bed at a London hospital.   ""Her clothes had not been changed. Her daughter had to borrow a bowl of water to wash the blood that had   become caked on her mother's hands and feet.""   This was a superb example of traditional shroud-waving, as admired by connoisseurs as a majestic pass by a bullfighter.   Mr Blair did not disappoint. He gave a traditional reply to the flapping linen: ""The Conservatives want to use these cases ... to run the NHS down. They want to say it has failed, therefore get rid of the health service on which people are depending.""   In other words, the Tories complain about people getting poor treatment because they want to make sure they get no treatment at all.   A 16-year-old could see what nonsense that is, but then, thanks to Mr Blair, they don't yet have the vote."
9,"We go to inordinate lengths to avoid civilian casualties,' said the junior defence minister, John Spellar, yesterday. It's an odd word to use, 'inordinate', since its meanings, according to Collins, include 'unrestrained, intemperate, irregular, disordered.' Which seems to sum up Nato's strategy pretty well. It also summed up the opposition, which is just about as irregular, disordered and intemperate these days as you can get.  But the Commons as a whole is getting edgy about this war and the Tories in particular look ragged. 'Lack of moral fibre', they would call it in the army. Yesterday they were more jittery than ever before, and this was before anyone knew about Milosevic's offer. John Maples, the Tories' defence spokesman, said there had been 'a quite unacceptable degree of incompetence' in the Chinese embassy bombing: 'The address of the embassy is in the phone book,' he added, bitterly.  George Robertson admitted that it had been 'a huge and terrible error', but even so he quickly wrote it off, to his own satisfaction at least. 'Expressions of regret have been made,' he said airily. You got the general impression that he couldn't quite see what all the fuss was about. Given that Nato had bombed a nuclear power with a seat on the security council, he seemed somewhat offhand.  Diane Abbott asked if there weren't maps of Belgrade which showed foreign embassies, and got brusquely ticked off for her pains. 'Can I say that facetious remarks about targeting are not appropriate in these tragic circumstances?' said the defence secretary. What a marvellous politician's reply that was! Your side makes a dreadful and avoidable mistake (how many billions of dollars is the CIA given each year not to read the Belgrade A-Z?) and when someone points this out, you accuse them of levity in the face of death.  Martin Bell, who probably knows more about the Balkans than any 10 MPs put together, said scornfully that 'the greatest military alliance in the world is becoming 'the gang that cannot shoot straight'.'  George Robertson just about held the line. But then Robin Cook made a statement. You could tell how rattled he was (the death of his highly regarded junior minister, Derek Fatchett, can't have helped at all) when Alan Clark made some remark about a Belgrade street map, and he snapped 'that was a very tasteless remark'.  Given that Mr Clark is the Commons' unquestioned king of tastelessness, I thought that, for him, it was positively genteel.  Then Michael Howard got up and started talking about 'grave disquiet' on the Tory benches. There was a feeling, he said, that 'the action is being made up as we go along, and has not properly been thought through'. The gist of it was that the whole thing had gone horribly wrong and it was probably the government's fault.  Mr Cook was furious. Why did the opposition keep shifting the basis of its support for the war? He contrived to accuse Mr Howard of being soft on Milosevic. 'We are fighting a great evil. It would be helpful if you endorsed any of my statements about the nature of that evil,' he said to Tory shouts of 'withdraw! withdraw!'  Which he did later, in distinctly grudging fashion, adding: 'I do find that for every criticism of Belgrade there were five criticisms of the allies.' But it was already clear what was happening. The Tories, like so many rats in Savile Row suits, were sashaying down the gangway of the sinking ship, their gait speeding up with each alarming lurch of the liner."
9,"A handful of Labour MPs turned up on the day after the Queen's speech. And most of them could scarcely be bothered to stand up and ask a question. Nobody believes in this thing. It's not worth the parchment it's written on. David Heath, for the Lib Dems, called it an abracadabra Queen's speech. ""Shazam! The deficit halved at a stroke. Shazam! Poverty abolished around the world. This is fantasy politics!"" Other MPs were fractious about losing the public's attention. Nigel Evans thought it ""bizarre"" that more people were interested in how John and Edward performed on The X Factor than in the new president of Europe. I don't know. The Irish twins have more in common than you might think with the various dreary factotums who are standing for EU president: (a) rather weird faces, (b) even weirder hairdos, (c) come from very small country, (d) no perceptible singing talent, and (e) unjustified but relentless ambition. In a desperate attempt to make themselves relevant, MPs drag in popular culture whenever they can. Peter Bone, the Tory MP who looks exactly like Sven-Gran Eriksson, said he hoped Harriet Harman would become prime minister. He claimed to be the founder ""and, sad to say, the only member of Hots  Harriet's Official Tory Supporters!"" This was a deeply embarrassing moment, as if Mr Bone had decided to make public a liking for rubber underwear. Ms Harman reacted rather like a young woman being wolf-whistled from a building site and pretended she hadn't heard. Or at least heard properly. ""I had not realised that the hon member was hot,"" she replied. Some of us didn't know where to look, but he could not be stopped. ""No, you're hot!"" he exclaimed. Fresh trousers for Mr Bone! Michael Gove, the Tory education spokesman, may have been watching I'm A Celebrity  because suddenly he accused Ed Balls, of being ""the Katie Price, the Jordan of the government. All he is interested in is being on the front pages, so he has massively inflated what he has to offer!"" Oooh, missus!  Actually this was Mr Gove's attempt at revenge, for earlier he was the victim of a fine coup de thtre by Mr Balls. The education secretary said he was fed up with the Tories saying that GCSE exams had been dumbed down. He had with him a few questions from recent GCSEs. Would Mr Gove care to answer them? This from the additional science test: ""Name the type of enzyme that digests stains containing fats."" Mr Gove squirmed slightly but offered no answer. Mr Balls, who is a playground bully at heart, realised he had found a victim. ""Explain how a fluoride atom can change into a fluoride ion! The hon gentlemen is well known as an erudite and intellectual man. What is the answer?"" Then: ""Does he want to try that? Wanna try?"" He sounded like an aggressive thug chanting ""Want some, do yer? Want some?"" in a pub car park. Finally he demanded, from the maths paper: ""Work out three and three-quarters minus one and two-fifths."" Mr Gove again, sensibly, offered no reply. (It is two and seven-twentieths.) The bully had won."
9,"It was the Threadneedle Spectator parliamentarian of the year awards today. Lord Mandelson was the big winner. (I wasn't a judge, so I am not to blame. Others know who they are.) He received his award for politician of the year from Boris Johnson. It was, Mandelson said, a great honour. He was the first winner since 2006 not to have been a member of the Bullingdon Club. Then he added: ""This is another to add to the list of things I have in common with Boris. We both spent a long time in Brussels. We both had very public resignations. And we both have an overwhelming ambition to do everything we can to undermine David Cameron."" From his right came harrumphing and denial. ""Humph. No! No! Harrumph,"" cried Boris. This protestation might have been slightly more convincing if it hadn't been for Boris's own speech a short while before. This took the form of a mock-heroic address to MPs, who had created a ""magnificent catastrophe"" to distract attention away from the banking scandal. ""How proud I am!"" he said, addressing MPs, his former colleagues. ""I want to give you the most massive plug  but unlike Jacqui Smith I would not dream of claiming for it  for the chaotic, shambolic handling which has brilliantly directed media and public anger away from the financial services of London!"" Warming to his theme  and Boris never cools to any theme on which he has embarked  ""you resemble Leonidas and the Spartans, or Clint Eastwood in The Bodyguard, standing in the path of public rage! You have taken the bullet for the bankers!"" Why, he said, it was marvellous that MPs should win all these awards. They would each need a trophy cabinet from Ikea, or possibly John Lewis, to display them all! This would go on their additional costs allowance. The cabinet might be so full that it could damage a wall. They would need to grow wisteria on the outside of the wall. So: ""It would be necessary to add a wisteria trimmer to the bill.""  Did he mention moat cleaning, or duck houses, or flat-screen televisions? No, he mentioned only wisteria trimming. And who is the only MP to have claimed for wisteria trimming? Why David Cameron. You might need to be obsessed by politics, or by the control of climbing plants, to understand what he was talking about. But we knew. That is Boris's genius. He always gets it both ways. Most other award winners were just happy to get their gong and go. Kenneth Clarke, ironically named newcomer of the year, said the judges had made an old man very happy. Paul Farrelly, the Labour MP Carter-Ruck tried to silence over the Guardian's revelations of toxic waste dumping in Africa, was named inquisitor of the year and said it showed there was life in the ""old dog of parliament"". The Tory peer Lady Warsi was moving. She said she had been voted sexiest member of the House of Lords, ""but in light of the fact that I've still got my teeth, that's not so extraordinary. ""But I am the daughter of a Pakistani immigrant mill-worker, and I ended up in the House of Lords."" We all applauded madly what a wonderful country we still think this is."
9,"John Prescott paid a welcome visit to the House of Commons yesterday to launch his department's new white paper, Our Towns And Cities: The Future.  This is a classic New Labour document, being printed on glossy paper and illustrated with colour pictures of the Elysium which is the new Britain. Happy people, many from ethnic minorities, gaze productively at computer screens. Pensioners get off a gleaming streamlined tram which has just delivered them promptly and inexpensively to their grandchildren.   In New Labour's dream world, canals are for strolling by, past bustling pavement cafes where laughing groups of people drink cappuccino in the sun. And they're definitely not full of dead cats, condoms or rusted supermarket trollies.   The prose has the same unreal quality. Nothing actually happens, nothing tangible is planned. But, we are promised, there will be ""innovative developments"", ""local strategic partnerships"" and ""urban policy units"".   Town councils will have   ""new powers to promote wellbeing"". As members of society, people will need to be able ""to achieve their full potential"" while ""protecting the environment, both local and global."" To make sure this happens, the government's ""policies and programmes are the building blocks,"" and just in case we might think this may never happen, we're promised that ""visions for the future will be developed"".   There will be a ""key focus"" here and a ""coordinated effort"" there. The government, in its wisdom, has ""established a framework"". The whole thing resembles those fantastical architect's drawings, in which slim, well-dressed figures stroll across tree-festooned piazzas, with   no mention of empty burger boxes or gangs of glowering youths.   But Mr Prescott's statement, far from being the jumble of words we have come to expect, was an oral version of the same thing. I have noticed that the time to become suspicious about this government is when it breaks into capital letters. This invariably represents not the real world, but some new initiative, programme or quango.   He is setting up Regional Centres of Excellence. He has established a Neighbourhood Renewal Fund. He is considering an Urban Policy Board, and a Cabinet Committee is to hold an Urban Summit in the year 2002. Let's not forget the Integrated Transport   White Paper, the New Deal for Communities and the Social Exclusion Unit. Capital letters were all over the shop, each in charge of a resonant abstraction.   We hacks were abjured yesterday by Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press secretary to mark the difference between scepticism and cynicism. My attitude to Mr Prescott's statement was a balanced mixture of both.   At one point, for example, he reminded us that Lord Rogers had said, ""people make cities, but cities make citizens"". Tories giggled at this, crying ""wozzat mean?""   ""Think about it!"" he bellowed back, though I'm afraid I was none the wiser. You could say, ""people make   cars, but cars make drivers"", or ""people make alcohol, but alcohol makes alcoholics"".   This kind of talk spreads among the very people who use it. Mr Prescott got confused about the technical terms for a city. ""The city of York already is a city, as is my own city of Hull is a city, and that I think is the definition of city and town.""   Faced with these massive piles of abstract thought, there was little the Tory spokesman, Archie Norman could say or do. ""The only time we ever see the deputy prime minister,"" he grumped, ""is when he has a glossy brochure or a disaster to announce.""   Or, I reflected yesterday, possibly both at the same time."
9,"We were gathered for the launch of an exciting new thinktank, ResPublica. It was particularly thrilling because David Cameron was there to pat the tank on the head and send it on its way. The launch was in a hotel conference room festooned with velvet drapes, chandeliers, tapestries and tiled pilasters. It looked like the entry hall of the most luxurious brothel in Bradford. Behind the platform was a placard announcing the aims of the new tank. ""Radical solutions  revolutionise innovation  sustainable future,"" it declared. My law of reverse meaning states that if the opposite of something is obvious nonsense, it wasn't worth saying in the first place, as in ""tinkering at the edges  sticking in the mud  using tomorrow's resources today!"" The room was filled with 300 people. We asked a thinktank tankie who they were. ""They are the great and the good of the policy world!"" he replied. My heart began to ache and a drowsy numbness started to numb me, drowsily. David Cameron arrived. We hear that many of his shadow cabinet are deeply suspicious of ResPublica, which they fear smacks of socialism and some forms of rightwing fundamentalism. They see it as a freemarket Hizb ut-Tahrir. No wonder Mr Cameron did not stay long. ""It's great to be at the launch of another thinktank in Britain!"" he said, stressing the word ""another"" so giving his welcome a slightly sarcastic air. He galloped along. We had a broken society, broken politics, and a broken economy. We needed the ""bigger society""  whatever that might be. And people were often in public services because they loved their work. ""We have to unlock the love!"" he exclaimed. The one and only begetter of ResPublica, its director, Phillip Blond, said the Tory leader's diary did not permit him to stay. I'll say. He was out of there like a cat chased by a dog on a skateboard. This left the platform bare except for Mr Blond, who spoke with such profundity that I found it hard to stay awake.  I was jerked into life when he pointed out how Conservatives had always been great liberators. They abolished slavery, and it was Tories who led the factory reform movement, ""against Guardian-reading Manchester liberals"". Heavens, Guardian readers get blamed for a lot, but I didn't realise that included child labour. ""Profoundly individualating,"" he went on. ""Reciprocality!"" he demanded. ""Universality should not be compromised!"" He called for an ""eco-structure for exchange and ethos"". I would have paid more heed to these thunderous abstractions if Mr Blond hadn't looked like a cross between Gordon Brown and DCI Gene Hunt in Ashes To Ashes. ""Policing the model,"" he said. (""Awright, Ms Campbell, better come wiv us, my girl, or you'll cop it."") ""Economic actors,"" (""I'd love to buy a round, darling, but I seem to have become parted from my wallet."") ""Postmodern verity  against an objective void."" ""Hear, hear, that needed saying!"" as no one remarked. Finally it was over. The food afterwards was great."
9,"The Tories must be glad that the new leader of Ukip left their party years ago. At a time when David Cameron is trying to shorten the names of any Tory who sounds even slightly toffish, the last thing he wants is another old Etonian, especially one named Malcolm Everard MacLaren Pearson, Baron Pearson of Rannoch. I suspect that he would be even less willing than Annunziata Rees-Mogg (Nancy Mogg) to have his name shortened to, say, Mal Pearce. What's more, M.E.M.P.B.P.O.R has a set of views  being anti-gay, anti-Muslim and pro almost any form of hunting  which would curl the neck hair of Tory frontbenchers such as Georgie Oz, Andy Lans, Frankie Maude and others, some of whose names have been conveniently pre-shortened, such as Tess May, Bill Hague and Eric Pickles. And Lord Pearson received £100,000 over six years by claiming that his £3.7m house in London was his second home. And he owns 12,000 acres in Scotland. In short, he is everything Davy Cam is trying to get rid of, or at least brush under the carpet. Anyhow, Lord Pearson is now in office, and has annoyed many in Ukip by saying that if the Tories ever promised a referendum on our continued membership of the EU he would disband his own party. Today in the House of Lords he asked the government whether they would hold a referendum. The answer, from Glenys Kinnock, was ""no"". She added that his offer to liquidate his own party was a ""rather original approach to leadership"". In fact, everyone patronised him, and once you have been patronised by their lordships, you stay patronised. Lord Tomlinson announced gravely that Lord Pearson had shown ""a standard of leadership which screams that the other party leaders do not have a great deal to worry about"". Lord Dykes, a peer who believes we will be better off governed by Belgians and Luxembourgeois, who know better than we do how to govern ourselves, said it was an eccentric state of affairs. Lord Pearson qualified for the Guinness Book of Records as the only new party leader who had caused a mass resignation three days after he had taken office. Lord Pearson will not, I suspect, fret too much about this criticism. Back in the Commons, Liam Byrne, who is number two at the Treasury, was making a statement with the risky title of ""smarter government"". This seemed to involve cutting the deficit by saving money. But no member of this government could ever say anything so simple. Instead, Mr Byrne, who collects jargon like Madonna collects babies, told us his plans would ""make it easier for civic society to contribute to public life by pressing ahead with the new social investment bank and by testing social impact bonds"". He would also ""free up the front line to innovate collaborate [sic] by cutting back on ring-fenced budgets and national targets  joint ventures and regulatory flexibility"". The low droning sound of Mr Byrne describing his incomprehensible plans was suddenly cut by an agonised cry from Sir Patrick Cormack: ""Can you PLEASE speak English?"
9,"For those of us who were there in Zimbabwe twenty years ago, it's agonising to see how quickly and steeply the country has descended into poverty, corruption and violence. In those days there was far more optimism than foreboding. The country was rich and fertile. With the Victoria Falls, Kariba and Wankie game park, it was sensationally beautiful and tourism was about to take off. Race relations could only be thought good if you lived in blinkers, but they certainly lacked the bitterness of apartheid South Africa. Even at the height of the civil war anyone, white or black, could walk round the capital - then called Salisbury - in perfect safety. Whites had hoped that the first free elections would be won by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, but he was seen as a tool of the white oppressors, and never stood a chance against Robert Mugabe. Even so, whites were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, while he called himself a Marxist, he claimed he had learned the lesson of Mozambique, which was not to expel your white farmers.    Well, the farmers know better now. There was always something rather naive, sometimes engagingly so, about Zimbabwe's white people, the lost tribe of Africa. Some, mainly in the towns, were breathtakingly rude to their black employees (""munts"" was the favoured term of disparagement), and gave the impression that they didn't even realise how humiliating they were. (Who in their right mind wants to be surrounded by people who detest you?) The farmers often believed that they were deeply loved by their workers. They pointed to the accommodation, the schools and the full dinner plates and contrasted this comparative comfort and security with the spiralling descent of Zambia,  just across the Zambezi. Even the tiny handful of white Guardian Weekly-reading liberals were horrified at that decay. The distinctly unliberal majority had a simple world-view, expressed by Ian Smith, their spiritual as well as political leader, who told me that the capture of southern Africa was a straightforward communist plot, masterminded from Moscow, permitted by gullible and feeble Europeans.     It was then, as now, a land of the most puzzling contrasts. Two decades ago I sat in a beautiful, white-owned Salisbury garden, lunching with among others, Dumiso Dabengwa, then Joshua Nkomo's chief of staff, now the home affairs minister. ""Mmm,"" he said with relish, as he sipped from his glass, ""South African wine! Delicious! So much better than this Zimbabwean muck."" I who would not have let a drop of South African wine sully my lips at home could only marvel about how much I had to learn about the continent."
9,"Normally I would not dream of quoting from a private letter, but Sir Peter Tapsell has topped his note to me ""Personal (up to a point!)"" so I assume he will not mind my sharing the splendid news with you. For on Friday last, Sir Peter was readopted to contest the general election in the Conservative interest for the constituency of Louth and Horncastle. It will be his 15th campaign, and he will almost certainly have turned 80 by the time it takes place. You could almost hear the huzzahs ringing down from Lincolnshire! What makes his victory especially piquant is that as part of his 45-minute speech to the Conservatives, he read out part of one of my sketches. This was from 2006, shortly after Tony Blair had claimed that God would judge him on Iraq. At the time I compared Sir Peter's interventions to watching Alfred Brendel and George Best in action. (I was tempted to rewrite the Tommy Cooper joke: ""Trouble is, George Best was a hopeless pianist and Alfred Brendel couldn't play football."" But I didn't.) Sir Peter had finished his majestic question to the then prime minister, ""Will he tell us which archangel is now beckoning him towards southern Afghanistan?"" No wonder that, even in this youth-crazed world, Sir Peter was chosen again. Yesterday he was in his place listening to the prime minister make another statement about Afghanistan. Sir Peter believes that we should not have gone there in the first place, and that  since the Soviets could not hold the country with 300,000 men  our 500 extra troops will not make the slightest difference. Gordon Brown's statement required a certain understanding of metaphysics. The gist seemed to be that because our military intervention had been so successful, we needed more troops to make it even more successful. And we should send extra men now so that our lads could come home earlier. And the fact that several countries were threatening to remove their forces from Afghanistan meant that even more nations would be represented there soon. Hmmm. You can always tell when a policy is in trouble when the politicians start turning it into new cliches. ""We need a military surge, complemented by a political surge, which is essentially an Afghan political surge,"" he said. Try prising the sultanas out of that cake! Sir Peter did not at first rise to ask a question. Instead he used body language, the Esperanto of the Commons, to express his deep dissatisfaction. He rested his hands on his lap aggressively, if you can picture that. He leaned forward and scowled. At one point he leaned back, folded his arms, and looked, simply, furious. The prime minister continued, deploying more weird pronunciations. (""Mastiff"" armoured vehicles he calls ""masteef"" to rhyme with the French ""canif"". Al-Qaida is no longer ""Alky Ada"", the drunken old aunt. She has become Al, Kay, Ada  a music hall act of the inter-war years. Finally Sir Peter could bear it no longer. He stood up and, in his pomp, asked a question not about Afghanistan but Pakistan. So it was a disappointment for his fans, but our cup of good news was brimming over anyway."
9,"The gloating faction of Labour MPs were hard at work yesterday trying to inject some triumphalism into an otherwise somnolent house. David Winnick, for instance, renewed his attack on Harold Pinter. This practice of MPs attacking playwrights instead of each other is new. Perhaps they will start putting their views up outside theatres.  ""Disgraceful treason!"" - Gerald Kaufman. ""Should be hanged with the intestines of a Serb infantryman"" - David Winnick.   Mr Winnick asked: ""Will we be informed if that discredited gang of appeasers outside - people like the Pilgers and the Pinters - have written and apologised, having got it completely wrong?""  It was interesting that the gang's political wing - Benn, Corbyn, Mahon, etc - were absent from the chamber, no doubt canvassing.  But Tam Dalyell was there. Tam has staying power. If Tam had solemnly announced on Monday that next day the sun would rise in the west, he would be there on Tuesday afternoon announcing that the sun's arrival in the east posed a series of almost insuperable problems. But at least he would be there.  He told Mr Winnick: ""I have to say, frankly, that I have shared platforms with John Pilger and Harold Pinter, and the apology for which you ask may be forth coming, but it will be in five years' time, when the position might be altogether clearer.""  Oh yeah? I'll check back in five years. I suspect they'll apologise around the time Tam stops talking about the Belgrano, or when the rings of Saturn melt, whichever comes first.  Meanwhile, the sound of the government refusing to crow has become almost deafening. Tony Blair addressed the nation from Downing Street and told us: ""I feel no sense of triumph now. We began this air campaign with reluctance but resolve. We end it with no sense of rejoicing.""  Back in the Commons there was a startling sight: a Labour defence secretary announcing the successful end of a war. I do not know if this has ever happened before.  But the new watchwords ""Don't rejoice! Don't rejoice!""   are on the bleepers, and George Robertson was firmly on message yesterday. He did allow himself a jab at ""those who said there was nothing we could do, let the blood flow, it will stabilise - they have been proved wrong, and I hope one day they will apologise"". But the tone was downbeat and even weary.  John Maples, the Tory spokesman, is lucid, coherent and speaks well without notes. Yet somehow he could not find a word of praise for Mr Robertson. His carping was a smooth parliamentary performance, but wretchedly wrong for the day.  Mr Robertson has had a good war, and so has Robin Cook. Mr Cook will never be a greatly loved politician, in the way that a few such as Mo Mowlam and Denis Healey lodge in the public affection, but I suspect that from now on he will be respected."
9,"Tony Blair went to university in the early 1970s. It was a time on the whole when rhetoric was frowned upon. People thought it insincere and manipulative; they spoke in a relaxed and laid-back sort of way, meant to sound friendly, open, un-pushy.  That, I suppose, is why he introduces so many sentences with a light laugh, or words like 'look', and 'well . . .' The message is always, 'I think I'm probably right here, but of course you can disagree!'  I'm sure it's the perfect way of persuading the Students' Union not to raise the price of sticky buns in the cafeteria, but it seems slightly inappropriate as a means of rousing a nation to war.  But over the last days and weeks, the Prime Minister's style has crept slowly towards the declamatory. Churchillian cadences are sidling in.  'Day and night, our pilots are risking their lives. . .' he said yesterday, while reporting to the House on Kosovo.  'Day and night, our forces are working . . . And day and night we are preparing for the job we will have to do when our military objectives are met.'  It doesn't quite work in a television age. It's as if Alan Titchmarsh from Ground Force were to stop giggling and declaim: 'I shall not rest until the scourge of weeds has been eliminated from this plot, this blessed patch of earth, this Eden men call 47 Acacia Grove . . .'  'Ethnic cleansing must be defeated, and seen to be defeated. Milosevic's policies must be defeated, and seen to be defeated,' the Prime Minister continued, but in the manner of Mr Perkins of personnel explaining how important it was to replace the toner in the Xerox.  The House was divided, between the majority who see the Kosovo Liberation Army, as heroes of our time, and those who regard them as moustachioed drug dealers who have enlisted Nato as their own personal heavies.  Donald Anderson wanted them armed and trained to fight alongside our lads. 'They know the terrain, and can help our forces,' he said.  Mr Blair reacted as if he'd suggested enlisting Yardies to help with race relations.  Tam Dalyell, who opposes the bombing, asked a perfect Tam question. This always takes the following form: 'Is the Prime Minister aware that [name of somebody you have never heard of] firmly believes that [something Tam agrees with].'  'Are you aware of the judgment of Spyros Kyprianou that this will go on for 100 days? Or that the German Federal Criminal Agency points out that the ethnic Albanian community are the most prominent group in European drug trafficking?'  'Oh, Tam,' moaned some MPs. Mr Blair bridled. 'I really can't understand your comments about the Albanian community,' he said. Didn't Tam realise, he implied, that the plucky Kosovans are on our side, for the time being at least? Clearly ethnic cleansing is one thing; ethical cleansing quite another.  Roger Gale quoted someone better known, the BBC's John Simpson. He had reported from Belgrade that the bombs were 'the best recruiting sergeant for Milosevic'.  Mr Blair made a rare attack on the Sainted Simpson. 'We should treat with suspicion reports on TV, when we know how they see only what the Serbian government wants them to see.'  Some of us suspected this was actually aimed at another TV reporter, Martin Bell, who is thought beyond criticism, and who had declared that 'circumstances on the ground can only be changed by boots on the ground'.  Alan Clark finds himself in agreement with much of the Labour left, but for opposite reasons. 'We are associating ourselves with the sustained bombing of a brave and Christian people who have never injured or threatened a single British citizen.'  The lefties looked distinctly queasy at that support."
5,"Just before the Leicester South by-election on 15 July a flier was slipped under the windscreen wipers of cars in the constituency. It showed a picture of Parmjit Singh Gill, the Liberal Democrat candidate, shaking the hand of one Stephanie Dearden. She looked odd, like a man: indeed, the flier told us, she once was a man. It announced in bold capitals that Singh Gill had joined the Liberal Democrats for GAY, LESBIAN, BISEXUAL and TRANSGENDER Action. Underneath it quoted Ms Dearden as saying: 'I was born in 1956, and as a child growing up, I knew I was different than everyone else. As I got older I realised I was a woman trapped inside the wrong body ... I underwent a full sex change operation in 2002.'  No one knows who put the leaflet out. It may have been a rival party. It may have been a freelance queer-basher who got his angry thrills by monitoring obscure trans-gender websites. But the message to working-class voters was that the Liberal Democrats were a bunch of weirdoes who hung out with lady-boys and shemales - an appeal to prejudice which echoes much of modern political propaganda.  It's no secret who put out leaflets during the by-election held on the same day in Birmingham Hodge Hill which followed a West Midlands tradition of gutter politicians appealing to xenophobia.  In 1964 the Tories secured a shock victory in Birmingham Smethwick with the catchy slogan of 'If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour'. In his 1968 'Rivers of Blood' speech to members of the West Midlands Conservative Political Centre, Enoch Powell attempted to turn the white working class from Labour by telling them that 'in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the upper hand over the white man'. It worked. Not only did he incite the mass beating of blacks and Asians, but Powell's racism helped the Tories win West Midland marginals and with them the 1970 general election.  Before the 1997 election, Andrew Lansley, a Tory minister and born-again Christian, declared that immigration had hurt Labour in the past and has 'more potential to hurt' in the future. Nicholas Budgen, a wizened Powellite, took him at his word and tried to stop Labour taking Powell's old seat of Wolverhampton South West seat by running on an anti-wog ticket.  Rather marvellously, he lost. And, equally marvellously, Tony Blair declared in his speech to the 2000 Labour Party Conference that he wanted nothing to do with such squalid politics.   'I know asylum is a problem and we are trying to deal with it, but if people want me to go out and exploit the asylum issue for reasons of race that we all know about, then vote for the other man because I will not do it.'  But that was in 2000. In 2004, when it risked seeing the Liberals take Birmingham Hodge Hill, Labour reshuffled the pack and played the race card which had been played against it so many times before.  Liam Byrne, the Labour candidate, told the voters, 'I know that people here are worried about fraudulent asylum claims and illegal immigration. Yet the Lib Dems ignore what people say. They ignore what local people really want. The Lib Dems want to keep giving welfare benefits to failed asylum seekers. They voted for this in Parliament on 1 March 2004. They want your money -and mine - to go to failed asylum seekers.'  Labour didn't mention that the disputed measure was a plan to take the children of asylum seekers from their parents and put them into care, which Michael Howard had denounced as 'despicable'.  The leaflet implied that Byrne was a comrade of the working class rather than a former City slicker who made his pile as an accountant at Andersons Consulting and a banker at NM Rothschild. 'I know what you want,' he cried. 'Someone who is tough and on your side. Someone who wants the same as you. And I do. I want to push my new baby's buggy along the road without having to face a gang of youths spitting and swearing.'  Who would want that? But I suspect that the babies of former employees of Rothschilds don't have to endure too many tours of the Birmingham slums.  In Fairness, the Liberal Democrats often provoke their opponents into going over the top. They pose as saints while fighting campaigns which are as dirty as anything Labour or the Tories can manage - often dirtier. They shift their shape depending on which constituency they're contesting. Are they right or left? Pro-privatisation or anti? For the overthrow of Saddam Hussein if the weapons inspectors had been given more time, or against?Answers to these questions have more to do with geography than ideology. For the duration of a campaign, the Liberal Democrats are whatever a contested constituency wants them to be.Thus in Hodge Hill, a Lib Dem leaflet sent to predominantly Muslim wards featured a picture of Charles Kennedy surrounded by Asians. The same leaflet was pushed through the doors of predominantly white wards, but only after a quick bout of ethnic cleansing at the printers had removed all trace of the brown faces.And, as I'm incessantly told, it's true that the right-thinking, left-leaning middle classes need to think carefully before dismissing New Labour's crime and asylum policies as stunts used by the powerful to con the powerless into voting for them. (They still are, but we'll leave that for another day.)Crime rates may have collapsed, but the sale of council houses has meant that some of the nastiest families in the country are concentrated in the remaining estates. Asylum seekers, like prisoners released on licence and the mentally ill being cared for in the 'community', are also sent to the poorest neighbourhoods least able to cope with them.But when all the caveats have been made, having a rich man rouse popular passions by posing as a commoner helped Labour hang on to Hodge Hill, and is a sign of what's to come. You can   expect a lot more in the Byrne style in the run-up to the election.The Hartlepool by-election will come first. The Tories are out of it, as they are out of most things, and once again Labour isn't fighting the Lib Dems on its impressive economic record. Instead it's following the pattern of Hodge Hill and accusing its rivals of being soft on drugs, soft on pornography, soft on teen gangs and soft on crack houses. Typical of the guff was Labour's claim that the Lib Dem lawyer candidate had made 'excuses for junkies', because she had once represented heroin addicts in court.Barristers have to take whatever cases are allocated to them. By Labour's logic Cherie Blair is a supporter of the poll tax because she once represented councils seeking to extract money from protestors who couldn't or wouldn't pay.I shouldn't have to add that raising prejudices by banging on about crime and race are the desperate strategies of right-wing parties with their backs to the wall, and you might have expected an uprising from within the Labour ranks.But where is a principled opposition to come from? From the Labour left? At the time of the Hodge Hill election Ken Livingstone was embracing as a comrade Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a 'moderate' Muslim leader, whose Islam Online website supports the murder of Israeli civilians because 'on the hour of judgment, Muslims will fight the Jews and kill them'; describes homosexuality as an 'evil and unnatural practice', which can only be stopped when Islamic society is cleansed of its 'perverted elements'; says rape victims must carry a portion of the guilt if they dress 'immodestly'; and advises that a husband may beat his wife 'lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive parts'.The new Respect Party, which boldly proclaims itself to be a left-wing alternative to Labour, is as willing to ally with religious barbarism and the enemies of the Enlightenment as Livingstone, and is led by George Galloway, a man who flew to Baghdad to greet a fascist dictator with: 'Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.'These are paradoxical times. The Conservative Party is nowhere, but conservative ideas are everywhere, not least on a left whose manic skid to the far right makes the slipperiness of the Liberal Democrats and the willingness of Labour to betray its principles appear modest changes of position in comparison."
5,"Our former American territories are not making much of a go of independence. As in so many other post-colonial statelets, the exhilaration of liberation has been replaced with apathy and disgust. You cannot be elected President without the approval of the local business mafias. Successful candidates take their bribes - sorry, campaign donations - of about $1.5 billion and promote their interests in office. Half the electorate does not bother to vote. Two million people in prison, most of whom seem to be black, cannot vote. The candidate with the most votes does not win. The dead are elected to the Senate while the living are disenfranchised. If this were Sierra Leone, we would send in the troops. As this is the United States, however, we are receiving their troops. At the RAF Menwith Hill and Fylingdales bases in Yorkshire, whose 'royal' titles disguise their  de facto  status as American possessions, the Pentagon is installing the radar required by the National Missile Defence system - or Son of Star Wars. The nation which will be defended is, needless to say, America; we will just be a target for any country which wants to take out US defences.  To describe Star Wars as criminally insane is to slander reputable psychopaths. It is inspired by the delusion that America can achieve absolute military dominance, that she can fight without taking casualties, forget about deterrence and detonate nuclear weapons secure in the knowledge that her defensive missiles will shoot down any warheads launched in retaliation.  Not surprisingly, Sha Zukang, China's chief arms negotiator, has warned of a new arms race - Beijing will not 'sit on its hands' if the system is deployed. Vladimir Putin promised a huge cut in the number of Russian warheads if Bill Clinton backed off. Documents passed to the  American Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  by a helpful mole showed that the President preferred taking the most extravagant risks to abandoning the fantasy of war without   tears. Clinton tried to persuade the Russians to accept his unilateral jettisoning of treaty obligations Star Wars will bring by pledging that both countries 'will possess under the terms of any possible future arms reduction agreements, large, diversified arsenals of strategic offensive weapons'.  In other words, the Americans were happy to see what Stephen I. Schwartz, the publisher of the  Bulletin, described as Russia's 'bloated, ageing, and dangerous arsenal of approximately 6,000 deployed strategic nuclear warheads' remain in service. The weapons are on a hair-trigger alert, ready to fire within five minutes of receiving a launch order. The Russian military has degenerated as fast as the Russian economy and is more than capable of starting a nuclear war by accident. In January 1995, Russian radar mistook a scientific rocket from Norway for a Trident missile from a US submarine. The potentially costly error was corrected two minutes before counter-attacking missiles were due to launch.  Despite the waste of billions of dollars, none of the Star Wars trials has succeeded. Yet missile defence was not discussed in the US election. When Newt Gingrich and the Republican far Right proposed reviving Ronald Reagan's illusory, expensive and destabilising system which, as they well knew, would tear apart the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Clinton and Gore sabotaged debate by bravely triangulating and conceding they had a point.  In the presidential campaign, Gore promised 'to protect against ballistic-missile attacks from rogue states', as did George W. Bush. Dubya may install Star Wars faster than Gore, who could stick to Clinton's decision not to deploy until 2006. Bush may throw more money at missile defence. But then again, Gore could surprise his abused supporters on both counts. Once you start triangulating you never stop.  If Gore is the victor of the Florida shambles, he will have to deal with a Republican Congress and it would surely be 'pragmatic' and 'realistic' to shimmy ever further to his right. What else are Third Way politicians meant to do? Make a stand on sense or principle?   The hard-faced men at Lockheed Martin, Boeing and the other arms companies, who will receive a minimum of $60 bn of corporate welfare if Star Wars goes nuclear, are confident that the differences between the candidates are trivial. They have financed the Republicans and the Democrats in an illuminating example of what the Americans call bipartisanship.  Gore has not said and wasn't asked where the rogue states can be found to justify the expenditure. North Korea looked promising after it launched a rocket. Alas, Kim Jong-il, her hereditary communist dictator, then ruined everything by negotiating with South Korea and opening diplomatic relations with the West.  Bush, who looks like being the hereditary President of the United States, is equally confused. He told an audience in Iowa: 'When I was coming up, it was a   dangerous world, and you knew exactly who they were,' he said. 'It was us versus them, and it was clear who them was. Today, we are not so sure who they are, but we know they're there.'  The quote can be found in the collections of Bushisms which are delighting British sophisticates. What a jerk and a dolt the man is, and who but jerks and dolts could have voted for him? Most of our elegant politicians may be able to get through a sentence without a verbal nervous breakdown, but are no brighter.  The patriotic Conservatives, ever eager to denounce European threats to Westminster's sovereignty, have accepted that a foreign power should make Yorkshire the object of a pre-emptive strike by any future enemy of America. New Labour, meanwhile, has been begged by European governments to tell the Americans that Britain will refuse to help destroy international treaties. Robin Cook would clearly like to do just that, but the Prime Minister and Geoff Hoon, the crushing Blairite bore in the Ministry of Defence, are terrified of offending Washington.  Hoon came up with Bushist syntax of his own when he said in March that 'the history of close friendship with the United States is that we are sympathetic to such requests'. After this performance, the Americans were confident Blair would obey orders. Kevin Bacon, a Pentagon spokesman, said of Britain: 'It's too early to predict a problem there. I wouldn't anticipate a problem there.'  As Mark Bromley and Tom McDonald of the British American Security Information Council, point out, the Government wants to keep the 'special relationship' with America and support arms control. It seems incapable of accepting that it can no longer do both.  Blair hopes that Gore will somehow get to the White House, as, I guess, do most  Observer readers. I would rather see Bush win. If the Prime Minister bows to the demands of man he must despise, it will have the small advantage of revealing that our servility before American power is nothing other than colonial."
5,"At the beginning of the Second World War, George Orwell gave the young Christopher Hill a stinking review of the sort that no author forgives or forgets. Writing in the New Statesman, Orwell tore into the historian who was to become a great and generous interpreter of seventeenth-century English radicalism - and Master of Balliol to boot. Hill's best work was to come. In 1940 Orwell's fury was provoked by his juvenilia, The English Revolution: 1640, a book with a fair claim to be the most simplistic Marxist version of history published in Britain in the twentieth century. Orwell identified a persistent fault of the far Left. Like those who give a knowing wink and insist that the war against Iraq is 'all about oil,' Hill and his comrades were too 'cocksure'. They wrote off 'religion, morality, patriotism [as] a sort of hypocritical cover-up for the pursuit of economic interest' when they insisted that the Parliamentarians' war against Charles I could be reduced to a battle between the rising class of capitalists and the dead weight of the feudal monarchy.  'A ""Marxist"" analysis of any historical event tends to be a hurried snap judgment based on the principle of cui bono?, something rather like the ""realism"" of the saloon-bar cynic who always  assumes the bishop is keeping a mistress and the trade union leader is in the pay of the boss,' Orwell continued.  Such reasoning was a hopeless guide. 'Long after Hitler came to power official Marxism was declaring that Hitler was of no importance and could achieve nothing. On the other hand, people who had hardly heard of Marx but who knew the power of faith had seen Hitler coming years earlier.'  Hill was buried on Friday. Before his body was cold, Anthony Glees of Brunel University and the  Times went way beyond the charge that he was once a supporter of Communist orthodoxy and apologist for Stalin's crimes. 'Was Oxford's most famous Marxist a Soviet mole?' asked Wednesday's Times. With Glees's help, it answered its rhetorical question with a triumphant 'Yes.'  Hill had hidden his Communism and tunnelled his way to the Russian desk at the Foreign Office during the war. He had suggested that white Russian emigrs should be purged from British uni  versities. He formed a friendship with Peter Smollett, head of the Russian desk at the Ministry of Information and an acquaintance of Kim Philby. Before fleeing to the Soviet Union, Smollett performed many small services for Stalin, including persuading several publishers to turn down Orwell's Animal Farm.   When I talked to Glees, he said Hill had been 'sinister and disgraceful.' His research proved that Hill was a Soviet agent in the Foreign Office, and a demoralised Hill had come to his home in 1983 and admitted that he was guilty as charged. Glees went on to wonder whether Balliol should go through its records and discover what Hill had been up to when he was Master. The apparently fair and kind scholar may well have promoted left-wing students in the 1960s and 1970s while obstructing the careers of Conservative undergraduates. Glees would not go on the record and name the beneficiaries of Hill's patronage, but he had his suspicions.  Stalinism is in the air, and not only because it is the 50th anniversary of the old bastard's death. In Saddam Hussein, Iraq has a tyrant who models himself on Stalin. He has followed to the letter Stalin's policy of killing rivals before they are a threat - even before they know themselves that they might one day be rivals strong enough to pose a threat. (This tactic alone explains why it is difficult to think of a way other than invasion to get rid off him.)  Yet virtually everyone I meet doesn't want to hear about Saddam's crimes or read the fraternal requests for support from democrats and socialists in the Iraqi opposition. Like the Left of the 1930s, they put their hands over their ears and scream whenever either subject is mentioned. Just as the greater cause of anti-fascism led decent people to turn a blind eye to Stalin's crimes in the 1930s, so the often silly cause of anti-Americanism leads decent people to turn a blind eye to the plight of the Iraqis.  You didn't need to know too much about the dark side of the Left to shudder and think 'Oh no, not again' when Tony Benn flew to Baghdad and played straight guy to a monster with the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands. (Benn: 'I wondered if you would say something direct to the peace movement that might help advance the cause they have had in mind.' Saddam: 'We pray to God to empower all those working against war and for the cause of peace.') Benn's subsequent insulting of an Iraqi woman in London as a 'CIA stooge' made the comparison perfect. Reports from Stalin's death camps were dismissed as fabrications of the capitalist press in the 1933: the cries of Saddam's victims are dismissed as CIA 2003 propaganda.  Many in the anti-war movement don't bother to hide their nostalgia. George Galloway, an MP whose pain all sensitive souls must share when Saddam is taken out, was asked last year if he would describe himself as a Stalinist. 'If you are asking did I support the Soviet Union, yes,' Galloway replied. 'The disappearance of the Soviet Union is the biggest catastrophe of my life.'  A neat theory is available. The new Left is repeating the crimes of the old. What Christopher Hill began, others are determined to finish. It doesn't work - in Hill's case at least.  Hill would not have liked Orwell's review, but on one point he wouldn't have quibbled. When Orwell said that Hill was a spokesman for 'official Marxism' - that is, that he was a Communist - Hill would have agreed. Of course he was. His books were issued by Lawrence &amp; Wishart, the Communist Party's publishers, and followed the party line.  Real moles hide everything. They last thing they would do is send out Communist tracts to be reviewed in the New Statesman by hostile critics who would point out their Communism as a matter of course. When Philby was recruited in the mid-1930s, his Russian handlers instructed him to drop his left-wing politics. He was to catch the eye of MI6 by pretending to hold the views of the establishment. In the 1930s, respectability came by posing as a quiet admirer of Nazi Germany, editing the journal of the Anglo-German Fellowship and joining the staff of the Times,  a paper as slavish towards Adolf Hitler then as it is towards Rupert Murdoch now.  I can't prove that Hill is innocent of the charge of treason, and Smollett undoubtedly was a Soviet agent. But the Soviet Union would have been remarkably foolish if it had recruited Hill, and MI5 even more foolish if it had failed to spot the agent. It is no defence of what Hill believed to say that his Stalin-worship was respectable in the 1940s. The establishment became pro-Soviet when the Soviet Union became Britain's ally in the Second World War. The Times switched from admiring Hitler to admiring Stalin. The British government sent Russians who had fought with Hitler to die in Stalin's death camps. Among the publishers who turned down  Animal Farm  for fear of offending Stalin was T.S. Eliot, who has yet to be accused of being a Communist spy - although anything is possible at the moment.  Hill never gave up his Marxism, but left the Communist party in 1957. He went on to rescue the histories of the Levellers, Diggers, Ranters and Fifth Monarchists from obscurity. More than any other historian in the twentieth century, he showed how ordinary people developed ideas of democracy, socialism, secularism and women's emancipation as soon as civil war destroyed censorship and political control and allowed them the space to think and argue.  The most moderate of the radical groups were the Levellers. All they wanted was democracy. But 350 years on Tony Blair behaves with the arrogance of a Stuart king and refuses to countenance the thought that the voters should be free to send their representatives to the House of Lords.  Because the 'good old cause' of the seventeenth-century radicals is still unfulfilled, the ideas that the old Master of Balliol revived will survive long after the Saddams and Galloways are gone."
5,"On Monday, Joe Biden, the chairman of the American Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, gave Washington journalists a disconcertingly prescient speech. 'Our real security needs,' he said, 'are much more earthbound and far less costly than National Missile Defence_ the Joint Chiefs say a strategic nuclear attack is less likely than regional conflicts, or major theatre wars, or terrorist attacks at home and abroad. We will have diverted all that money to address the least likely threat while the real threats come into this country in the hold of a ship or the belly of a plane or are smuggled into a city in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack.' The next day, mid-twentieth-century jet flight and seventh-century ecstatic martyrdom combined to produce mass murder. Biden didn't exactly predict the method which would devastate the Pentagon and downtown New York. But he was far closer to the mark than the extravagantly funded secret policemen in the intelligence services and bluff analysers of clear-and-present danger in the West's terrorism and foreign policy institutes.  'Blowback' is the jargon word for his well-founded fears. 'We have nothing, you have everything,' the hijackers said in effect to the financial and military &eacute;lites of the world's hyperpower. 'We can still take your technology and blow it back in your faces.' Blowback weapons must necessarily be relatively low-tech and easy to obtain and deploy: sarin or VX nerve gas released in a subway; an old Soviet nuclear weapon smuggled over the border in a lorry and exploded in the capital; fuel sprayed into the skies and ignited to create an 'air bomb'. Blowback works best when, as last week, there's no claim of responsibility or obvious target for reprisal.  One might have thought that invokers of national security would be alert to the menace. But just as those who are hardest on criminals are softest on crime, so the loudest patriots make the most treacherous garrison. For years, rational debate on the proliferation of weaponry has been drowned by the howls of the American Right barking up the wrong tree. The 'threat' it chose to magnify was the most unlikely imaginable. National Missile Defence, or the 'son of Star Wars' programme, envisages that starving Iraq or North Korea or Afghanistan would spend billions of dollars building intercontinental ballistic missile systems. These would be sitting targets long before they could be armed with warheads. Despite these handicaps, Star Wars' defenders insisted, 'rogue states' or terrorist groups would carry on regardless and risk annihilating nuclear retaliation by launching missiles from identifiable bases against America.  Billions of dollars have been spent by the Clinton and Bush administrations to protect the United States against this fantastical nightmare. Star Wars probably won't work, but the fear that America will be able to dispense with the mutually assured destruction of deterrence theory, and fire nuclear weapons   from behind the safety of an anti-ballistic shield, will push Russia, China, India, Pakistan and, possibly, Japan into a grotesque and unnecessary arms race.  If it is to have Star Wars, America must make the world a more dangerous place by tearing up the 1972 Anti- Ballistic Missile Treaty. The unilateral insistence that the laws which apply to others do not apply to the United States incites the anti-Americanism righteous Americans find incomprehensible. The dizzying gulf between Washington and the rest of the planet was perfectly exemplified by Douglas J. Feith, an anti-Soviet hawk who Bush dug out of post-Cold War obscurity and plonked into the highest echelons of the Pentagon.  On Tuesday, he was in Moscow. He told the Russians there could be no compromise on Star Wars. His hosts took him to a press conference where he learned that the World Trade Centre and his very own offices in the Pentagon had been blown to pieces. Yevgeny Primakov, the former Russian Prime Minister, said that all America's arguments for missile defence had been 'swept aside' by the slaughter. Journalists followed up by asking if Feith would reconsider Star Wars, given that it wouldn't have prevented one plane being hijacked or saved a life. 'I don't think it's fair to say that the system that is designed for a specific purpose is flawed because it doesn't accomplish something that it is not designed to do,' Feith sniffed. 'I guess I have difficulty with the question.'  He found it easier to contemplate the murder of his fellow citizens and the destruction of the Pentagon he served than to doubt the theology of Star Wars. He just didn't get it. But Britain didn't either.  After George W. Bush plucked up the courage to return to Washington, he made an appeal for multilateral unity. In less terrible circumstances, it would have been as risible as Tony Blair's loyal reply that he would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the President. The question both begged was what was the world meant to unite around? Blair told the Commons on Friday that common purpose could be found in abhorrence of crimes against humanity. 'These attacks were not just attacks upon people and buildings, nor even merely on the USA. These were attacks on the basic democratic values in which we all believe so passionately and on the civilised world.'  In 1998 the civilised world, as represented by 140 governments, created the International Criminal Court to judge the grossest violators of life and liberty. Bill Clinton gave the court America's endorsement in the dying hours of his presidency. Bush is determined that America will not meet global standards. He has asked the lawyers, who fought so well for him in Florida, to discover if there is a way of 'unsigning' the treaty. Bush's Republican allies in Congress want to authorise the US military to free American soldiers remanded in custody by the court. The only explanation for American opposition to international law was that her generals could see themselves committing a few war crimes, as they may well do in the coming days.  After Blair had sat down, Jack Straw sensibly added: 'We also need to focus our attention on where the next threat to our collective security will come from. Efforts to prevent the proliferation of chemical, biological and other weapons must be redoubled.' In July, Bush wrecked a decade of negotiations on the enforcement of the global prohibition of biological weapons. The protocol would have given independent inspectors access to laboratories in the signatory countries. The pharmaceutical conglomerates, who bankrolled Bush's campaign as enthusiastically as the manu facturers of Star Wars, claimed industrial and military espionage would follow.  Without independent verification, the ban on biological warfare is so much waste paper. Any laboratory which wants to manufacture the ideal blowback weapons - they're cheap and can be 'smuggled into a city in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack,' as Biden said - has little to worry about. People who ought to know in the defence bureaucracy tell me that the rogue laboratories may be American. The Star Wars fantasy is accompanied by the dream of building a biological weapon programmed to target the DNA of Saddam Hussein, for example, or Osama bin Laden, if anyone knows where he is.  Neither the Prime Minister nor Foreign Secretary had the bad taste to ask if unity is meant to be found in unconditional support for the most criminal members of the Israeli Right? Or the judicial execution of children? Should we agree, perhaps, to come together in opposition to the Kyoto protocol on global warming? Or the proposed agreement to regulate the trade in small arms? Or to the comprehensive ban on the testing of nuclear weapons? On all these matters, a unilateral America is on its own or thereabouts, although with so much anti-Islamic junk about the 'clash of civilisations' in the air at the moment, Bush can deflect accusations of racism by pointing out that Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen are standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with him on a sovereign state's inalienable right to kill kiddies.  I'm sure he is grateful for their backing. Nevertheless, it seems a little late in the day to be asking the rest of the world for multilateral support.  To be fair, Tony Blair may have grasped the contradictions and be using the kamikaze attacks to persuade Bush that he must co-operate with others. Yet whatever gentle hints he's dropping in private, the Prime Minister has already failed the big test. If there is to be concerted action against terrorism in the Middle East and Central Asia it will require the support of Russia and China. Both have been infuriated by Star Wars.  Blair might have stopped the nonsense at the start by refusing to allow the American bases at Fylingdales and Menwith Hill to be used as forward stations to track missiles. I've written before that Star Wars won't defend Britain and Blair was obliging a foreign power by turning his country into an unprotected target. I have to confess I wasn't at all sure how simple it would be for America's enemies to attack Yorkshire. Last week got rid of that doubt.  The Prime Minister chose to put indulging Bush before the true interests of Britain and America. He has proved, yet again, that sycophants are the worst of friends."
5,"Yesterday, about 300 hunts were roaming Britain. If you saw one, you may have wondered if parliament truly had banned hunting with dogs a year ago. Almost everything would have looked as it had always done. Perhaps a few of the hunters would have set off early to lay a trail and one of them could have been carrying a falcon. But the riders would still have charged over the fields and their dogs would still have chased any fox that crossed their path.The anti-hunting law that aroused so much passion is now producing contempt and indifference. Only one hunt has closed and hunters behave as if the 700 hours of parliamentary debate that preceded the ban was so much wasted breath. Those of us who weren't caught up by the passions of either side are seeing the obvious flaw in the legislation work itself out.The difficulty was always that the anti-hunters weren't trying to protect foxes, but punish a particular type of hunter: the caricature Tory toff with a red coat and redder face. As foxes go for lambs and chickens, parliament couldn't declare them a protected species and be done with it. So today, a farmer can still shoot or snare a fox, but if he goes after it with more than two dogs, the police will arrest him. That's the theory. In practice, the police have arrested hardly anyone.Lord knows, I find the class hatred behind the hunting of the hunters easy to understand. Britain is the only rich country not to have had a modern revolution. In France, America, even Ireland, hunting arouses no great opposition because the aristocracy's estates were broken up in the 18th and 19th centuries, or were never there in the first place, in the case of America.The typical continental smallholding, with a few acres on which the owner can do as he or she pleases, is a rarity here. This land is not our land but the property of great families or the Forestry Commission and the National Trust. Naturally, its owners are resented. I also understand how after 18 years of Conservative rule, Labour MPs wanted to get their own back on the Tories and, indeed, on Tony Blair, who had made them to give up so much they held dear. Nevertheless, their vengeance is looking futile: a pretence that the parliamentary Labour party could still fight a war Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair had won. The MPs who forced through the ban are starting to resemble an old drunk pretending to be tough by flailing his fists in the air.Because their leglisation would not and could not protect foxes per se, hunters are exploiting all kinds of loopholes. As there is no ancient hatred of falconry in Britain, parliament allowed falconers to set off with an unlimited number of dogs to flush out mammals for birds of prey to swoop on. All right, said the hunts, we'll take a falcon with us.The law says the police have to prove that hunters intended to set their dogs on a fox, otherwise they would have to prosecute a pet owner whose dogs bolted in the country and killed a fox. All right, said the hunts, we will lay a trail for the hounds to follow and if they run off after a fox, we can say our intention was to have a drag hunt, not a fox hunt.The current issue of Horse & Hound contains an interview with one Graham Sirl, who says he despises the League Against Cruel Sports and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for running a lavish campaign that has now produced 'absolutely zero'.No surprise that Horse & Hound should condemn the ban as an absurd waste of parliament's time, you might think. And it wouldn't be surprising if Graham Sirl wasn't a former chief officer of the League Against Cruel Sports. He's not alone in giving up on the cause he once championed.In the past decade, the league has lost two chief executives, two chairmen, one treasurer and one regional head. All of them concluded that an effective ban would lead to the slaughter of foxes by farmers with guns who no longer wanted to keep them alive for the hunts to chase. I cannot think of another protest group that has seen so many of its officers go over to the other side. It is as if senior staff of Greenpeace regularly joined the board of Texaco.The people who are at the league, for the time being at any rate, told me they expected the police to collect evidence that the hunts are intentionally breaking the law and bring prosecutions soon. If they don't, their ban will join Margaret Thatcher's prohibition of the promotion of homosexuality and Jack Straw's curfews for children in that list of fatuous legislation that was designed to make vocal minorities feel good and succeeded only in bringing the law into disrepute.<b> A good man done down by ideology</b>It has long been the case that universities which depend on free speech have contained too many intellectuals who are ready to censor and howl down others. The forced resignation of Larry Summers as president of Harvard, however, takes the treason of the clerks to a new level.His critics hounded him out for being a sexist who believed that nature had made men better engineers and physicists than women. Even the BBC reported last week that he faced a second no-confidence vote because he had said women had less 'intrinsic aptitude' than men for science.He said nothing of the sort. What he did do, in January last year, was go into a long and complicated discussion about why there were more men than women at the very top in maths and physics. He was talking about the few thousand people in the world who understand, say, string theory and wondering aloud if nature or nurture accounted for the sexual imbalance.Maybe nature matters at the highest levels, or maybe breaks for childbirth and social pressures that push young women away from studying science fully explain the difference. Even if he got the emphasis wrong, it ought to a legitimate area for debate. But his enemies didn't want inquiries of any sort. They spun his remarks and pretended he had said that any woman mathematician or physicist had less intrinsic aptitude for science than a bloke in the pub, which is clearly nonsense.That their campaign was successful throws a little light on the cowardly response to the threats against Danish cartoonists from murderous tyrants and religious fruitcakes. When the intellectuals whose livelihoods depend on free thought won't stand up for it, why shouldn't editors and governments follow their lead and abase themselves before fanatics?<b>Oh Huhne, my hero</b>Who can save Britain from her many troubles? We need a leader who is strong and brave and can see through problems with X-ray vision.For years, Chris Huhne roared round London in his company BMW as if it were a Bondmobile with lead-free petrol.Last week, he suggested another comparison when he told the Mirror that his mother, Ann Murray, was an actress who had played Clark Kent's mother in one of the Superman movies.He was 'rather vague about which of the Superman films she was in,' the Mirror noted, and I couldn't find one with an Ann Murray in the cast list.On no account should this apparent lapse stop the Liberal Democrats making Huhne their leader. He may not be able to play the superhero, but he is shaping up to be a fine comic turn."
5,"Every summer the graduates of Britain's universities decide what to do with their lives. As in previous years, thousands will have rejected the ideals of public service and the excitement of setting-up their own businesses and decided instead to fill the gaps in the ranks of Britain's 250,000 accountants.Britain has as many as the rest of the EU put together, and it's easy to see why. There's no state-guaranteed monopoly for engineers, factory workers, call-centre girls, small businessmen or women, computer programmers, inventors or any other wealth-creating trade. Indeed, when the working population's jobs head east they are told in thunderous voices that their sloth is being deservedly punished by the wrathful gods of the marketplace. But auditing can't go east. Every institution in Britain has to have its books audited by a member of one of the British accountancy associations.In theory they are the police officers of finance, forever on the lookout fraud and gross incompetence. In practice they differ from the police in one respect. Detectives are not allowed to sell 'extra services' to potential criminals. They might think twice before breaking up an international cocaine-smuggling racket if their force relied on that same ring for a large slice of its income. No similar pettifogging concerns about conflicts of interest constrain the accountancy racket. Accountants are free to sell advice on how to install IT or avoid taxes to the very managers they are meant to be policing on behalf of pension funds and employees. If they blow the whistle, they might lose the contracts, so the whistle has a tendency to stay in the pocket.  It shouldn't be a surprise to learn that British accountants make a comfortable living.  Management Today found that the average annual pay packet of British accountants in 2001 came to $117,000 (£82,000), which was way ahead of their nearest rivals in Europe, the Swiss, who struggled to get by on $73,000 (£51,000).  Thrusting graduates have always aimed to hack their way to the top of one of the 'Big Four' accountancy firms - PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG or Deloitte - which dominate the global and British markets. The most ambitious will hope one day to emulate Mike Rake, the head of KPMG, who last year received a 45 per cent pay rise to take his salary to £2.4 million.  'What do you spend it on?' a reporter from the Sunday Times asked. 'Sixteen polo ponies,' Rake replied.In the past, Rake and his colleagues were partners who had unlimited liability for their partnership's debts. Like the Lloyd's names, they put everything they owned on the line, and their exposure must have caused the odd sleepless nights. Auditors had approved the accounts of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Enron, WorldCom, Equitable Life and many another grotesquely mismanaged company. Until New Labour came to power the threat that Rake and his fellow partners might be sued for presiding over a disaster should have troubled even the self-confident head of KPMG. Everything, the pied--terre in London, the home in Henley-on-Thames, the villa in Spain and the 16 polo ponies, could have gone.  The example of Arthur Andersen provided a terrible warning. The Big Four were once the Big Five until Andersen approved the accounts of Enron and WorldCom and earned the imperishable distinction of failing to notice that the first and second biggest frauds in human history were going on under its nose. Andersen went bust because, understandably, no reputable organisation would go near it. The Bush administration reacted by making it all but impossible for auditors to sell other services to clients in the United States. What if Parliament was to enforce the same regulations here?  If Enron wasn't bad enough, what of the policy holders of Equitable Life who are suing Ernst &amp; Young for several billion for their failure to warn that the mutual was heading towards a financial calamity?  I don't know if Rake suffers from panic attacks. If he does, he will at least be able to reassure himself on one point: however calamitously the accountancy giants audit British business, his polo ponies will be safe. As this column has noted before, the most striking vice of New Labour is not its friendship with business - all modern governments have to make friends with business - but its anxiety to acquaint itself with the most notorious capitalists: the Mittals, the Hindujas, the Murdochs and, now I think of it, the Arthur Andersens. The Tories had banned Andersen from receiving government contracts after its perennially myopic auditors had failed to spot that tax-payers money was disappearing by the boot load from the DeLorean car plant in Belfast.  Andersen responded by sucking-up to New Labour and waiting for a change of regime. Patricia Hewitt was hired by its consulting arm. Andersen's services were offered free of charge to Labour when it was in Opposition. When Tony Blair won the 1997 election, the unpleasantness about DeLorean was tidied away and government contracts began to flow Andersen's way again. In 2000, the government bowed to a long campaign by the accountancy giants and limited their liability. Partners could protect themselves by changing their partnership into a limited company. Better still, they could still be partners and retain all the tax advantages and freedom from public scrutiny partnerships brought until they were successfully sued - when they would be able to claim the immunities of the directors of limited companies. The personal assets of the partners - the pads in Chelsea, the piles in the Chilterns - couldn't be seized by bailiffs whatever alternative they choose.  The old wisdom about never giving into bullies has held true. The Big Four weren't satisfied with the government's gracious treatment and upped their demands. With personal liability gone, they now want a cap on the damages their firms can be required to pay for negligence or fraud. If they don't get it, they warn that one of their number could go bust. The Big Four would become the Big Three and the group would offer an even less competitive service to the business world. As Rake put it, business 'can't afford to lose another accountancy firm'.  From inside the City the apparently outrageous demand for benefit of the clergy for accountants makes a kind of sense. What, after all, are the Big Four worth? Their offices in central London should be fetch a fair price, and photocopiers, computer terminals and the rest. But what was the main asset, the unlimited liability of the partners to meet debts, was removed by an obliging Labour government. A successful action by Equitable Life against Ernst &amp; Young could close it down because Ernst &amp; Young may no longer have the assets to redress the claims of the victims of its alleged ineptitude.Needless to say, Patricia Hewitt's Department of Trade and Industry has been convinced and is all for going along with the Big Four's demands for lame duck accountants to be protected as an endangered species.  But the rest of us may wonder that if claims for damages against accountancy firms can be capped, why shouldn't claims against any other business capped? Or claims against trade unions? Or hospitals? Or you? Or me? What incentive will there be for auditors to improve on their lamentable record if they receive fresh privileges? If they are hired by another Maxwell, why should they be any more concerned now about protecting pensioners from penury than they were in the 1980s?These columns normally end with a lament about the general worthlessness of New Labour's unprincipled ninnies. But for once there's a faint whiff of hope in the air. Last week the Office of Fair Trading said words to the effect that the Big Four should stop taking the mickey. Meanwhile institutional investors are lobbying against auditors being placed beyond the full reach of the law. According to rumour, they've been joined by Gordon Brown's Treasury.  If the rumour is true, then delegates preparing for the Labour Party Conference should consider asking the Chancellor to overcome his notorious politeness and put Ms Hewitt in her place. The Labour Party wasn't founded to create a Milton Friedman world of socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor; where Mike Rake keeps his polo ponies while savers with Equitable Life lose their pensions."
5,"With the Hutton Report due in weeks and Blair's future in the balance, it has never been more important to stay abreast of the news. Traditionally, the editor either instructs newsagents not to sell the paper to readers who score 10 or below in the annual quiz, or, if he's in a bad mood, persuades David Blunkett to intern them in Belmarsh.

5,"In 1991, I had my first and, alas, only taste of journalism as it is seen in the movies. I was called in the middle of the night to the home of a frightened source. After much fretting and several bottles of whisky, my appalling use of moral blackmail, which included appealing to his love for his children, succeeded and he agreed to hand over a secret document he had spotted at the offices of the Atomic Energy Authority.

My informant had been astounded by its contents. He waited until he was alone, made a copy and fled.

The depleted uranium shells used by the Allied armies in the Gulf War had left 'at least 40 tons' of radioactive dust on the battlefields of Kuwait and Iraq, the authority said. In theory, there was enough waste to 'cause 500,000 deaths'. A 'small dedicated team' should be sent to Gulf 'in total confidentiality' to establish the scale of the poisoning.

The Pentagon said that 860,000 DU rounds were fired in the Gulf War - the Americans liked the weapon because uranium strengthens shells and allows them to penetrate tank armour.

It was 'obviously not realistic' to expect mass deaths, the memo continued, because every one of half a million people would have to line up and ingest the dust, but, still, the authority was worried about radiation seeping into the water table.

The memo has been been bounced round the Internet ever since. It hangs in cyberspace, a prophesy of disaster no one quite knows how seriously to take. Could the low-level nuclear waste the West  left behind explain Gulf War syndrome and the birth of deformed Iraqi children? The debate is riddled with uncertainty.

What is clear is that a US Army study in 1990 concluded that no dose of depleted uranium 'is so low' that the probability of it causing cancer 'is zero'. A single charred shell emitted radiation three times stronger than the safe limit for members of the American public. When a German scientist brought a spent uranium round back from Iraq, he was convicted by a Berlin court for 'releasing ionizing radiation on the public.'

American A-10 'Warthog' planes armed with DU rounds are in action in the Kosovo war and the Pentagon now dismisses concerns that the shells cause sickness and mutilations as paranoid fantasy.

But when our politicians foresee that the consequences of the fight against Milosevic will be with us for generations, there is a nasty and unresolved suspicion at the back of many minds that they might be predicting more than they realise."
5,"The bad faith of the anti-war movement is revealed in what it doesn't say. For all its apparent self-confidence, the Left, reinforced by a small army of bishops, mullahs and retired generals, lacks the nerve to state that the consequence of peace is the ruin of the hopes of Iraqi democrats. The evasion is on a Himalayan scale. Unsurprisingly, the religious, with centuries of training in casuistry, are the most adept dodgers of the uncomfortable question: how can the peoples of Iraq overthrow their tyrant without foreign help? Many pious men and women signed the declaration of Pax Christi, the 'International Catholic Movement for Peace', which was presented to Downing Street last week. If the Prime Minister read it, he would have noted that in only one sentence did they accept that Iraq was a prison state. 'The people of Iraq,' Pax Christi said, 'must not be made to suffer further because they are living under a dictator who in his early years in power enjoyed the collusion and support of Western nations.' Pax Christi deserves credit for its scanty acknowledgement - Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford, managed to oppose war for 1,000 words on these pages last Sunday without once alluding to the nature of the Iraqi regime. But I would have thought that the dopiest theologian might have grasped that the people of Iraq are suffering, and will suffer further, precisely because they live under a dictator. The faithful can't say as much because the issue would then become whether the civilian casualties of a war would justify the removal of the oppressor.  As important would be the nature of the new government after the likely victory. The Foreign Office, US State Department and CIA appear to favour the replacement of one goon with another. In that instance, war would probably not be worth fighting. But the moral calculus would change if the West met the demands of the Iraqi National Congress, a loose coalition of Kurdish, Sunni and Shia opposition groups, and for once supported democracy and secularism in the Middle East.  The battle by the INC and others to win American backing for a democratic Iraq is being fought in Washington and London as I write. On Friday Colin Pow ell told opposition leaders 'our shared goal is that the Iraqi people should be free'. Whether his warm words were anything other than propaganda remains to be seen. His State Department had refused to talk to the INC for a year. Meanwhile George Tenet, the director of the CIA who, astonishingly, was not fired for his failure to protect his country on 11 September, has been an unyielding opponent of Iraqi democracy since he advised Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s.  I'm not saying Iraqi opposition is perfect. Generals who want a pro-American dictatorship form a part of it, while the two Kurdish factions in the INC were engaged in a civil war as late as 1996. Nevertheless, the heroism of many dissidents can't be doubted by those who are prepared to do what the Bishop of Oxford won't do and look at Saddam's regime with clear eyes. Among Amnesty International's voluminous accounts of executions and amputations in Iraq are descriptions of the collective punishment of their families. The fate of al-Shaikh Nazzar Kadhim al-Bahadli was   'typical', we are told. His wife, father and mother were tortured in front of him until he confessed to organising protests against Saddam. The latest grim dispatches from Iraq brought news of the execution of Abd al-Wahad al-Rifa'i, a retired teacher, who was suspected of having links to the opposition through his exiled brother.  The opponents of Saddam therefore include many brave men and women who are paying dearly to uphold the values of at least a part of the liberal-Left. They champion human rights and the protection of the Kurdish minority. Yet when they ask their natural allies to pressure Blair into supporting a democratic Iraq they are met with indifference or the preposterous slander that they are the stooges of the CIA.  A part of the explanation for the bad mouthing of freedom fighters lies in the belief that Muslims cannot handle and do not want freedom. On Friday yet another bishop - Colin Bennetts, the Bishop of Coventry, this time - wrote in    the  Guardian  that he opposed war because 'Muslim communities here in the UK would perceive a UK attack on Iraq as evidence of an in-built hostility to the Islamic world'. I bow before the Right Reverend's superior knowledge of the views of the superstitious, but can't for the life of me understand why he believes the rejection of appeals from Muslims for help in removing a secular dictator is anti-Islamic.  The greater reason for hostility is the ground shared by Left and Right. Noam Chomsky and his supporters have become the mirror image of the hypocrisies of American power. If the US encourages the persecution of Palestinians, but belatedly fights against Serbian ethnic cleansing, they will support freedom in the West Bank but not in the Balkans. In Britain the supposed extremes have gone a stage further and merged. It was as predictable as Christmas that the voices of Douglas Hurd and Sir Michael Rose would be among the loudest crying to leave Saddam alone.  As Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former Polish Prime Minister, said of the struggle to persuade Europe to stop Milosevic: 'Any time there was a likelihood of effective action, Hurd intervened to prevent it.' Rose, while refusing to contemplate decisive intervention by his troops in Bosnia, decided that denunciations of the rape and murder of Muslims were the work of 'the powerful Jewish lobby', and chummily regarded General Ratko Mladic, the butcher of Srebrenica, as a fellow officer 'who generally kept his word'.  Both have warned that an invasion of Iraq will destabilise neighbouring states. By this they must mean the theocracy of Saudi Arabia. You might have thought the prediction that war would set on fire a repellent Saudi monarchy whose religious police terrorise the population - and which sponsored the most brutal version of Islamic fundamentalism until one minute to midnight on 10 September - would have been met with the cry 'let it burn'.  But the Left appears as anxious to keep the lid on popular fury in the region as the Right. In their Commons motion, which is rallying Labour opposition, Tam Dalyell and Alice Mahon write, 'an aggressive war by Britain and the US would destabilise Iraq, risk provoking further conflict in the region and, inevitably, alienate the Arab states'.  There are honourable grounds for upholding the authority of the United Nations and opposing American global domination. What is dishonourable - indeed insufferable - is the pretence of everyone from Trots to archbishops that their animating concern is the sufferings of the peoples of Iraq.

5,"I know your New Year's Day will not be complete until you have heard my predictions for 2006, so let me put you out of your misery. David Cameron's bubble will burst when the public realises he's a PR man flogging a shabby brand. Tony Blair will stay Prime Minister after a crash in the property market triggers a classic deflationary spiral that shreds Gordon Brown's reputation for fiscal competence.There will be a few jolly diversions from mass unemployment. Margaret Drabble and the Archbishop of Canterbury will stun literary London and the General Synod of the Church of England when they appear on I'm a Celebrity... In sport, Laughing Boy will delight the bookies when he comes in at 100-1 to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Meanwhile in America, Congress will impeach George W Bush after he...I could go on. As I write, I'm aware that all around me, my colleagues are going on. Read the comment pages of the newspapers or listen to radio presenters giving soft interviews to their fellow journalists and a fair chunk of what you will get is Mystic Meggery. It is hard enough to find out what has happened or is happening, and yet a cocksure media devote an unwarranted amount of time to announcing what will happen.We are not alone. Interest rates and fiscal policy are determined by the Bank of England's and Treasury's economic forecasts. Clairvoyants in the City direct their investors' money to companies that are themselves predicting what new lines will sell. The lives of British troops depend on predictions of the likely behaviour of Baathist and al-Qaeda terrorists. Forecasting is the motor which drives politics, economics, foreign policy and industry, while our private happiness can be determined by predictions on whether he or she will say 'yes' if we ask for a date.The mania for prophesy is easy to explain. You have to make guesses about the future to know what to do in the present. The same magical status the Romans gave the keepers of the sacred chickens goes to those who make a career out of it, so there is a strong incentive to pretend you have second sight.But here is something harder to understand. I know a lot about British politics and have only a passing interest in racing. The odds are, however, that I am more likely to get the winner of the Gold Cup right than foresee who will be in Downing Street next Christmas. Actually, it could be worse than that. My political predictions may be more reliable if I made random guesses than if I sat down and drew on my expertise.I can at least foretell my failings with confidence because of a remarkable study by Professor Philip E Tetlock of Berkeley University in California. Expert Political Judgment has been 20 years in the making. He began work in the Cold War when the future of the human race depended on predictions about how the Soviet Union would behave. Liberals lambasted Ronald Reagan for upping the pressure on the communists and warned that his arms race would lead to nuclear annihilation.Not so, as it turned out. Soviet power collapsed. Conservative hawks would have had every right to be satisfied had they not completely failed to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union because they refused to take Mikhail Gorbachov's reforms seriously.Tetlock finished his work during the Iraq crisis in which intelligence agencies failed to predict that Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction worthy of the name. Liberal doves would have had every reason to be satisfied had not they completely failed to predict the success of the Iraqi elections.Over the decades in between, 284 experts in academia, government, think tanks and the media helped by giving him 83,361 forecasts not only on the future of the Soviet Union and American policy in the Gulf, but also on dozens of other public policy issues. They covered everything from the likelihood of Pakistan and North Korea obtaining nuclear weapons to whether Aids or refugee movements would create a humanitarian crisis; from how technology firms would perform in the dotcom bubble to whether countries would abide by their Kyoto commitments to limit greenhouse gases.Tetlock's research reached a blunt conclusion. A chimpanzee throwing darts at a dartboard with a selection of answers pinned to it was more likely to get it right than an eminent professor or distinguished pundit. Indeed, the more eminent the experts, the more likely they were to be wrong. Knowing a little was often better than knowing a lot, and specialisation in the minutiae of a subject was subject to the law of diminishing returns. Because experts invested so much energy in attaining knowledge, they could not accept thoughts that contradicted what they had learnt and staked their reputations on.To prove his point, Tetlock tells the story of students at Yale who had to guess where a laboratory rat would find food in maze. The rat won by a comfortable margin because the answer was stupidly simple. Pride handicapped the humans. The setters of their test made sure that none of the complicated mathematical formulas they had acquired could explain where the food was likely to be.The worst forecasters were those who appeared most often in the media. As anyone who has been on television knows, it fosters a manic egotism. Otherwise well-balanced people are filled with bombastic certainty - 'David Cameron's bubble will burst' - and make spectacular forecasts that please the producers by grabbing the attention of channel-hopping viewers - 'the property market will crash', 'the Archbishop of Canterbury will appear on I'm a Celebrity'.Beyond egotism and pride lies political bias. People who hated Ronald Reagan and George W Bush predicted their policies would lead to disaster, just as those who hated the Soviet Union and Baathist Iraq predicted that all would be well. I think that submerged bias explains the popularity of prophesy among civil servants, academics and broadcasters. They have professional obligations to be neutral. They can get round them by pretending to be time travellers who go to the future and impartially report on the calamities that will befall the world if their partisan views are ignored.Tetlock dismisses the comforting notion that public life is 'a marketplace of ideas', in which the peddlers of daft predictions are exposed as frauds or fools. The market does not work because large parts of the audience want comfort rather than truth. For instance, I have a deep and just possibly irrational dislike of PRs - and Tories, now I come to think of it. Those among you who share it won't turn on me if David Cameron is a winner. On the contrary, you might well turn on me if I accurately predict that he will be Prime Minister in 2009.The above makes Tetlock sound like a bog-standard postmodernist who believes that there is no possibility of finding objective truth. He hasn't ended up in the mire of relativism because, among his experts, was a minority whose predictions were good. In Isaiah Berlin's division of intellectuals between the darting foxes who 'know many little things' and the solid ideological hedgehogs who 'know one big thing well', Tetlock says the foxes won hands down.Like a stopped clock, the ideologues may occasionally be right, and the foxes could end up baffled if they darted about too frantically. Overall, however, it was forecasters who drew 'from an eclectic array of traditions and accepted ambiguity and contradiction as inevitable features of life' who performed well.With lives and livelihoods at stake, his findings are worth noticing. Tetlock offers three pieces of advice to politicians and others who must decide if a prediction is likely to be true. First, civil servants, academics, spies and - may the Good Lord protect and preserve us - journalists should be judged by the accuracy of their previous forecasts. Second, an audience should ask itself how well a prophet's beliefs reflect observable reality. Finally, it should check that the prophet updates his or her beliefs in response to new evidence.His last recommendation is the most important in my view. 'When the facts change, I change my mind,' said JM Keynes. My only good piece of advice for 2006 is you shouldn't listen to those who don't."

5,"In an address given to an aptly awful audience of venture capitalists a few months ago, Tony Blair adopted the modish confessional style and told the world that his struggle to manage the public sector had left 'scars on my back'. The National Health Service was not a home for the many under-resourced and over-worked people who run the most efficient medical service in the developed world, but a swamp of vested interests. Nurses, doctors and cleaners were the &eacute;lite forces of conservatism. The Prime Minister was their proletarian victim. Only the unreliable protection of an enormous Parliamentary majority and a Cabinet which will let him do anything he wants, prevented a martyrdom to rival Saint Di's.  After his performance, no one had the right to be surprised when he announced that henceforth the NHS would buy operations from private hospitals. A 'concordat' had been reached with corporate medicine. 'I have always made clear that it is not a question of ideology,' he said in July when asked if further treaties were likely.   Admittedly, this particular policy without ideology was the wheeze of New Labour's most influential think tank - the Conservative Party, which once was considered to be an ideologically motivated organisation. But all Third Wayers of good will and sound judgment could be relied upon to forget intellectual origins in this instance and agree that it is nothing more than plain common sense to cut waiting lists by snapping up private services. Who wouldn't prefer to be treated on demand by suddenly deferential consultants in a room of one's own, luxuriously appointed with pot plants the size of triffids, soft carpets and cable television? How many  Observer readers have forgotten their loud defences of the NHS when worrying pains afflict them or their loved ones and gone private? What matters is what works. Only a weirdo and probable paedophile would sacrifice the health of a child on the alter of an exhausted ideology. The private sector delivers.   It can deliver your child at the Portland Hospital, where Sarah Ferguson, Patsy Kensit, and Posh Spice were relieved of various sprogs. Those with other requirements can be sent to the Harley Street, Princess Grace or Wellington hospitals in central London. All four were brought by a company called HCA on 19 May. The US health conglomerate, which used to be called Columbia/HCA, but was forced to dance the old Windscale-Sellafield name shuffle for reasons we'll get to in a moment, added the Devonshire, Lister and London Bridge hospitals to its portfolio in June. The company intends to nab 'new facilities in markets outside the London area' as soon as possible.   Commercial rivals at the London Heart Hospital are so worried by the   Americans' predatory intent they are trying to excite a media campaign to persuade the Department of Trade and Industry to stop HCA creating a private monopoly in London. Sir Richard Needham, a former Conservative Health Minister who now runs the Heart, complained to me at length that HCA's associates, the PPP insurance company, had insisted their patients - sorry, customers - should be diverted from his beds to the rooms of HCA hospitals. Needham's colleagues say the loss of income may force him to sell to the Americans.   You may not care about Needham's problems - I won't pretend to have been sobbing myself - when HCA seems the better product. The company's PRs boast it is 'one of London's leading healthcare providers... committed to excellence and quality through the provision of specialised healthcare services. We have established an international reputation for offering the highest quality of service in private healthcare'.   They forgot to add that HCA's international reputation is somewhat tarnished. On 19 May it agreed to pay $745 million (£500m) to the US Justice Department for the greatest fraud in American medical history, without admitting liability, after two executives had been jailed. When other alleged scams are resolved the final fine will be about a billion dollars.   By purchasing private beds for public patients, New Labour is imitating American health care. The US government uses the Medicare and Medicaid national insurance schemes to pay 'independent' hospitals to treat working-class and elderly Americans. (The poor are left to suffer and die without health cover.) Charitable institutions with a rudimentary grasp of medical ethics are being taken over by medical conglomerates which seek to maximise profits. The US authorities cannot have officials on the spot to check that treatment is necessary and bills are accurate - if they did, they might as well go for the full Soviet terror of a 'socialistic' national health service administered by the state.   The result of a freeish market is pervasive fraud. June Gibbs Brown, Inspector General of the US Department of Health, estimated that private hospitals were overpaid by $23 billion (£15bn) a year. Fourteen cents in every dollar spent on health were stolen from the government by accident or design. Tales of scams fill the US press. There were the psychiatric hospitals which refused to release cash-earning patients even when they had recovered their wits; the psychologists who billed for 24 hours of therapy a day; and the health-company owners who claimed their son's first BMW was a medical expense.   The FBI investigation into HCA showed corruption went beyond the odd rotten apple. 'Columbia's fraudulent cost-reporting practices have infected the cost reports of virtually every health care facility,' the US government said in its affidavit.   As in Britain, HCA had engaged in the vigorous buying of beds and built a network of 340 hospitals. It was then able to add new euphemisms to the dictionary of fraud. Its executives tried 'upcoding': the exaggeration of the seriousness of an illness to receive higher fees; 'gaming': the double billing of the state; and 'physician partnerships': the practice of offering doctors shares, subsidised offices and directorships in return to steering patients to HCA hospitals.   Mark Gardner, who worked in three Columbia hospitals, testified: 'I committed felonies every day. Let me tell you this a ruthless greedy company. Employees are the largest operating expense. Cut that to the bone. Cut nursing to the bone.' The instructions were obeyed to   the letter. One nurse told how she was left to watch 80 heart monitors by herself. John W. Schilling, another whistleblower, said the company was confident it could avoid detection. Advertising and marketing costs were passed off as medical necessities and when the danger of a government auditor getting too close to the truth grew, he was told to buy her off with a job offer.   Their testimony sounds strange to British ears. Yet Action for Proper Regulation of Private Hospitals (whose website at www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk I urge you to read before paying for treatment) suggests that many American vices are here in embryo.   Private hospitals are dangerous places. They don't have the emergency teams of the NHS and their lovely single rooms are not the safest places to be when you need to attract attention urgently. For all the pampering on offer at HCA's Portland Hospital, the death rate of pregnant women is five times above the national average, as we reported last week.   Their parasitic nature is well known - they rely on the NHS to train their staff and to take their patients when an operation goes wrong or an insurance company refuses to pay for complicated treatment - but their imitation of US practices deserves a wider audience. The  British Medical Journal claimed in 1993 that at least one-third of all private 'hysterectomies... are unnecessary', while the growth in the number of 'therapeutically useless' removals of tonsils was an 'epidemic'.   The NHS, by contrast, has no interest in overcharging or performing pointless operations, quite the reverse. The largest employer in Europe is remarkably free of fiddles in all areas except one: consultants skipping NHS commitments to work in the private sector. There is a perverse incentive: unscrupulous consultants benefit if they persuade patients to pay to see them privately. Invariably, the consultants with the longest waiting lists are those with the largest private practices.   Instead of buying out consultants and giving them the generous salaries they deserve - for these are skilled men and women - to work exclusively for the NHS, the Government is making the perverse incentive more attractive still by pumping public funds to the likes of HCA. It claims that it will ensure that health authorities get value for money. If you were to point out that the US Government which has decades of experience of auditing private hospitals still cannot prevent fraud which would dazzle a mafioso, you would be dismissed as an ideological dinosaur. HCA has the advertising slogan 'You've Never Seen Health Care Like This Before'. Indeed you have not. But soon you may."
5,"Like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic, the Islamists of Sudan claim monstrous liars are libelling them. 'You are terrorists,' Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein, the regime's defence minister, screamed at journalists in Khartoum on Thursday. 'Any foreign correspondent from any foreign agency, get out - we don't want you in here.' His goons duly expelled reporters from his press conference for inventing the incredible lie that Hussein and his friends were responsible for the murder of around 200,000 in Darfur, the ethnic cleansing of two million, the arson, the rapes ... well, you know the story.Or maybe you don't. After all, it has not been in the news recently, and not only because Hussein is shutting out the journalists. Fashion matters and today the fashion is to ignore genocide. Quite rightly, the crimes of American, British, European and Israeli democracy are dissected and denounced. But an intellectual blockage - a Chinese wall in the mind - prevents the critics applying universal principles to far greater outrages.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, made my point for me in Sudan last week. Anyone who had heard the Church of England's censure of Israel might have expected to see a primate filled with righteous wrath. Consider his opportunities. While he was there, the genocide was continuing in Darfur. The victims were black Muslims, but strangely, the Muslim world has not revolted against the Islamist murderers and torched Sudanese embassies.In the name of inter-faith solidarity, Dr Williams might have found the words of reproach they lacked. If he didn't want to talk about Darfur, there was the decades-long civil war, which has seen the enslavement of the Christian Dinka tribe in the south and two million dead, more than in Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo combined.On a visit to a church in Khartoum, the fearless archbishop told the congregation: 'It will be a joy to share with fellow Christians in Britain what... I have learnt from you.' What he had learnt was a history of massacre, slavery and second-class citizenship, but he didn't mention it.The next stop was the Sudan Inter-Religious Council in Khartoum. This might have been the place to lay into the dictatorship's murder and persecution of Sudanese Christians. Instead, he confined himself to saying: 'We are at peace with God when we face our failings with honesty.' And so it went on. He travelled through a country torn by religious mania and genocide without mentioning religious mania and genocide.His office said he was picking his words with the care of a diplomat because his main concern wasn't the genocide in Darfur in the west of Sudan but the faint hope of a peace deal in the equally gruesome civil war between the Muslim north and Christian south, which he didn't want to jeopardise. In any case, his lecture to his Islamist hosts on facing 'our failings with honesty' was strong stuff by inter-faith standards.It may be tough talk if Anglicans are talking to Catholic bishops, but I doubt very much if it would have reduced the psychopaths of Khartoum to trembling penitents. To me, the failure of the archbishop to speak plainly was not a sign of his diplomacy, but flowed from his row with the Jews. Before he escaped to Africa, he couldn't say why he wanted sanctions against Israel but not against countries that committed far worse crimes - China, Syria, Iran, North Korea and, indeed, Sudan - or give any indication that he was morally obliged to provide an answer.A few of his critics just wanted to protect Israel come what may. Others were concerned about the retreat from universal principle into relativism. If you say there must be higher standards for democracies, you inevitably betray the victims of dictatorships by blocking your mind from thinking clearly and shouting loudly about their suffering.The confusion isn't confined to the General Synod of the Church of England. The United Nations tried to suppress a report that named the alleged war criminals of Darfur, in a way that it would never have suppressed the names of alleged torturers at Guantanamo. On the blacklist was that friend of freedom, Mr Hussein. While he was ranting at the journalists, he said that if the UN sent troops to protect the people of Darfur, al-Qaeda would flood the country. 'Darfur will become the graveyard for the United Nations,' he promised with what sounded like inside knowledge.Isn't that an extraordinary threat for a UN member to make? Why isn't every liberal newspaper and liberal party fulminating? Because genocide is out of fashion, dear. It may make a retro return in 2008, say, or 2009. Books called We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed will win literary prizes. Lachrymose documentaries will appear on BBC2, probably narrated by Fergal Keane. The Church of England will apologise, as it invariably does. They will all cry: 'Never again!' And at that precise moment, it will be happening again.<b>Labour laid low by the love of money</b>The other night on Radio 4's The World Tonight, I was up against an apologist for Tessa Jowell who turned out to be - er - the new editor of the Spectator, which I had always taken to be a Conservative magazine. Anyway, the Tory or Blairite or whatever he was cried that she was the victim of a 'lynch mob'.Tricky word 'mob'. I would steer clear of it if I were a supporter of Ms Jowell. This is a politician who invited 'friends of Italian opera' in Las Vegas to bring their super casinos to Britain. When the police proposed sensible restrictions to prevent money laundering, she and her civil servants fought them all the way.Meanwhile, her charming but dumped husband has helped Silvio Berlusconi avoid tax since the early Eighties.Berlusconi is not only a billionaire media monopolist, of the sort Labour people traditionally avoided. His power base includes the Italian neo-fascists and mobbed-up political hacks from Sicily. Decent conservatives condemn him as Europe's leading crony capitalist. But not Ms Jowell and Mr Mills, or Tony Blair and Ms Booth.This scandal is not about why the great feminist never bothered her pretty little head about all those mortgages. Nor does it turn on whether the prosecutors in Milan can prove that Berlusconi bribed her husband to lie. It is about the collapse of Labour's morality.I've been saying for years that Blair's fondness for the super-rich and, indeed, the filthy rich will be his undoing and obviously he and Jowell and the rest are still there.However, I get the feeling that unless Gordon Brown takes over and shows he is a true son of the manse by throwing the money launderers out of the temple, Labour will be finished.<b>The lure of filthy lucre</b>Round about 70AD, the Emperor Vespasian decided to tax Rome's lavatories. His refined son complained he was soiling the imperial purple with the odours of communal toilets. Vespasian picked up a coin and sniffed it. 'Pecunia non olet,' he declared with satisfaction - 'Money doesn't smell.'The Tonbridge gang probably shouldn't cite the emperor in their defence. The authorities are terribly proud of their 'cash dogs' - labradors and spaniels which can sniff out wads of notes. I had heard from a handler in London that so much cocaine was snorted off notes, the dogs smelled the drug. But a man at Customs told me they had been trained to smell the ink and would find the notes, cocaine or no cocaine.Pecunia non olet? Tell that to the cocker spaniels."
