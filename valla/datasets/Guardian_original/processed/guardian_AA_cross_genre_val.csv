8,"Michael Foot: A Life by Kenneth O Morgan HarperPress £25, pp568 The official biography is a dangerous book to write, especially if the subject is still alive and has made a personal choice of the author. Criticism reads like ingratitude and compliments are dismissed as obligations that were accepted with the contract. Fortunately, Kenneth O Morgan's record as both an academic and popular historian protects him from suspicion that he wrote Michael Foot: A Life without observing the rules of objectivity that a serious work on the career of a major politician requires. For most of the 494 pages of main text, Morgan's judgments of Foot are elegantly balanced. In the Fifties, he became 'an icon of the left, a star of pamphlet, platform and now television', but also ' ... an agitator of protest, not a politician of power'. Yet in the midst of the accurate narrative and careful analysis, there is one extraordinary lapse of memory or error of judgment. On page 436 (as incredulous readers can confirm for themselves), Morgan examines why and how Michael Foot became leader of the Labour party and concludes, with masterly understatement, that it was not 'in order to win an election'. He was elected 'to keep the party together'. But, dubious though that contention is, it cannot compete for improbability with what Morgan goes on to claim about the way in which Foot discharged that duty: 'This he did with patent sincerity and literary flair.' In fact, he did not do it at all. He certainly tried. But during the first year of his leadership, Labour suffered a split that was worse than anything in its history except possibly the schism led by Ramsay MacDonald in 1931; and the number of defections from both the parliamentary party and the party in the country were far greater than those that followed the creation of the National Government. And, unpleasant though the fact may be, it was all precipitated by the choice of Foot as leader. A couple of weeks before Jim Callaghan's resignation, I discussed the party's future with David Owen as we walked from the TUC to the House of Commons. Owen told me: 'It looks as if Denis [Healey] will get it and we'll be all right for another three years.' Last week, to confirm what I remembered, I asked Lord Owen if he would have left a Labour party that was led by Healey. He replied that the thought would not have entered his head. Nobody doubts that Healey would have produced a better election result than Michael Foot managed in 1983. We must not create the myth that Healey's defeat in the leadership election was necessary for the party's welfare. The crucial votes that guaranteed Healey's defeat came from craven members of the parliamentary Labour party who mistakenly believed that troublemakers in their constituencies would quieten down if an old left-winger became leader. They preferred the certainty of Labour losing the next general election to the risk of being ejected from their safe seats. Their cowardice was compounded by the treachery of a group of Social Democrat defectors who postponed their resignation from Labour until they had voted for the party leader who in their estimation was most likely to guarantee electoral disaster. Morgan identifies three of them. They did not think that Healey was the wrong choice to lead a revival. To describe the Eighties as they really were is not to diminish Michael Foot, particularly since some of the problems arose from his natural inclination towards tolerance and understanding. Foot was, and still is, a great man who deservedly inspires affection as well as admiration. But greatness comes in different shapes and sizes. Foot's gifts are not of the sort that make a successful party leader. Morgan is right to quote me, among others, in applauding the brilliance with which Foot led the House of Commons and kept the Lib-Lab Pact alive for the last two years of the Callaghan government. He was an equally adept Secretary of State for Employment who won the continued, if grudging, support of the TUC for the incomes policy, which was essential to the survival of the administration. But although, as this biography makes clear, Foot was a very good minister, Morgan's analysis always leaves the impression that he was, or would have been, even better at something else. And that, I suspect, is true. He was for the pen, not the sword, and believed that words spoke louder than actions. Foot was the greatest polemicist of his day, whose speeches and pamphlets - denouncing both the Tory government and the Labour governments of which he disapproved - no other controversialist could match. He is blessed with the supreme virtue of loyalty to such doomed causes as Plymouth Argyle's promotion into the Premiership and Barbara Castle's survival in the cabinet after Jim Callaghan replaced Harold Wilson as Prime Minister. And, almost half a century after his death, Aneurin Bevan remains a crucial influence on Foot's view of politics. When I invited him to take part in a television programme that I was narrating to mark the centenary of Clement Attlee's birth, he immediately told me: 'He should have made Nye Foreign Secretary.' But Foot also possesses an attribute which, while attractive in a normal human being, is a disastrous quality in a modern politician. He is an incurable romantic, hence his admiration for the Disraeli of his imagination. The real thing, the opportunist who destroyed his leader by supporting the Corn Laws (which he knew to be wrong) and then renewed his opposition when it was necessary for his own promotion, would have only excited Foot's contempt. Morgan makes clear that despite all the tribulations - the ill health, the uncertainties of youth and early manhood and the high propensity to suffer minor accidents - Michael Foot is blessed with an advantage that has seen him through life's vicissitudes inside and outside politics. He is, above all else, a rounded personality with the hinterland that Denis Healey, his vanquished opponent, rightly identified as essential to the civilised man. That made it a pleasure to work with him and serve under him, whatever the political prospect."
8,"The Barretts of Wimpole Street has a lot to answer for. It is by no means the worst play to be broadcast on Radio 4 on a Saturday afternoon. But, together with that extraordinary first letter from Robert Browning - ""I love your poetry Miss Barret and I think I love you too"" - it has created the legend of the frail young woman with heavy hair who eloped to Italy with the muscular Christian poet and, 15 years later, died in his arms. The facts on which the legends are built are true. But Elizabeth Barrett Browning was much more than the subservient invalid which so many of the comments that surrounded the bicentenary of her birth have made her out to be. The room with a view, from which the young EM Forster looked out across the Arno, is in a direct line of sight to Casa Guidi, in which the Brownings made their Florentine home. The plaque on the wall sets out Elizabeth's achievements - patriot, scholar and poet of the Risorgimento. It mentions, as an afterthought, that Robert Browning also lived there. I doubt if he resented the Italian precedence that his wife enjoyed. He believed that she had written ""the finest love sonnets in the English language since William Shakespeare"", and, by accident or design, she certainly followed where Shakespeare led. ""If thou must love me, let it be for nought"" is an echo of Sonnet 116: ""Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds"". Both proclaim that ""love for her smile, her look, her way"" is not an ""ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken"". How many other poets' work can be combined with Shakespeare's in a single sentence without seeming embarrassingly inferior? Yet, Sonnets from the Portuguese were the lighter side of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry. Her more serious work was very serious indeed. Every three or four years, I determine to write her biography. So every three or four years I read Aurora Leigh, according to its author a ""novel in verse"". Its 1,100 lines explore the position of women - thinking women such as Elizabeth - in Victorian society. It could not have been written by a woman who had grown up as one of nature's willing victims, waiting on her chaise longue to be rescued from her tyrannical father by the poet as hero. In fact, malicious rivals whispered that Robert Browning only cultivated Elizabeth Barrett because, thanks to her superior reputation as a poet, she provided him with an easy entree into literary society. It was Elizabeth, not Robert, who - according to the gossip - was considered for nomination as poet laureate. Nineteenth-century England was not ready for the laurels to crown a woman. Nor was the establishment in tune with her politics. Elizabeth became the poet of Italian unity and liberation. Her epitaph ought to be the poems Casa Guidi Windows and Garibaldi, not ""What was he doing the great God Pan, down in the reeds by the river?"". Robert Browning, to his credit, rarely missed an opportunity to reinforce his wife's reputation. In May 1880, 19 years after she died, he wrote to the Reverend Hugh Reginald Haweis with a gentle rebuke. ""You are misled about the poetry of EBB being almost forgotten ... The almost yearly new edition of her five volumes is out ... The demand for my own work is nothing like so large."" The letter also complained of a misprint in one of his own articles - ""human hair"" for ""human air"" and ""fair, like my peers"" instead of ""fare like my peers"". But the real message was that ""Elizabeth is more remembered than she ever was"". By then, Browning had achieved both critical and commercial success. But it is one of his ""difficult"" poems that provides the best, if an unintended, tribute to his wife. It is not one of the love poems from Men and Women but the much earlier Andrea del Sarto, subtitled The Faultless Painter. Andrea - said, in his time, to be a better draughtsman than Raphael - lacked the genius that produced ""ardour and admiration"". Elizabeth was exactly the opposite. There are rough passages in her poetry but the quality is beyond serious dispute. The disturbingly named Sir Walter Raleigh, Oxford's first professor of English literature, compared her to Christina Rossetti. Elizabeth, he said, often lost her footing, but - unlike Christina - never feared to leap. That is the poet whose work we ought to remember this year.<br />"
8,"Walking Ollie <br />by Stephen Foster <br />224pp, Short Books, &pound;9.99 Dog owners are born, not made. Or, if dog-owning is not a genetically induced passion, the need to possess one is likely to have been made irresistible by early environment. When I was six weeks old, Mick - my mother's fox terrier and the best rat catcher in the north Nottinghamshire coalfield - was found standing menacingly astride me in my pram. Long after Mick was dead, my parents argued about his motives. The disagreements always ended, after a long period of brainwashing, with my father agreeing that the dog's intentions had been benign. I listened to those disputes throughout my childhood, youth and early manhood. During that time we owned Teddy and Dinah and encouraged Bessie, from up the road, to spend her time with us. As a result of both the company and conversation I never doubted that I was for dogs and dogs were for me. Stephen Foster, on the other hand, had to acquire the feeling that he needed a canine companion. If Walking Ollie is to be believed, he acquired the lurcher as an act of kindness (to the dog and to his human partner) after examination of a dog book. No wonder that he found the early months of ownership heavy going. Owning a dog is not social work. It is a compulsion. It is because Foster failed to become obsessive that he turned all fastidious at the idea of ""picking up"" - the euphemism for removing dogs' excrement from public places. To avoid performing this essential task, he ""does not walk on pavements with narrow green sward alongside"" or cross the road at traffic lights. My dog, Buster - being trained in that respect if few others - defecates at regular times of day at easily anticipated locations. But retrieving, in a plastic bag, what he leaves behind never bothers me. How could I be repelled by anything that is associated with Buster? When Foster finally decides to share his life with a lurcher, he seems surprised that he has to prove that he is worthy of owning a dog. A similar cross-examination, when he thought of acquiring a vizsla, appears to have caused him less concern. Perhaps he thought that thoroughbreds should be treated with more consideration than crossbreeds. There is only one distinction between mongrels and dogs with pedigrees. Mongrels are brighter. Even that does not matter. Dogs are intrinsically endearing. Walking Ollie, being about a dog, is endearing too. It did not take long for Ollie - the eventual name of the lurcher that Foster acquired - to win over his new owner. And Foster quickly acquired some of the characteristics of the true canine devotee. It is dogs, not girls, that he looks at as they pass him in the street, and he is already worrying about how he will survive without Ollie. He has not quite reached the stage of absolute infatuation. I do not agonise about how to deal with Buster's death. I do not allow myself to think about it. When the prospect forces its way into my mind, it confirms my atheism. If there were a God, He would make dogs live as long as humans. Part of my obsession with dogs has an unhealthy connection with my mother's constant (and genuine, if embarrassingly misguided) conviction that every animal not under her care or supervision was lost, neglected or cruelly treated. I must, therefore, not overstate my anxiety about Ollie's prospects. But integrity requires me to report that he was once run over - sign of a careless owner or lack of training - and was also taken on a walk when the temperature was ""heading up to 100F"". Foster even went on holiday to Greece without him. In his diaries, Buster explains how I solved the dilemma about my regular summer excursions to Tuscany. I do not go to Tuscany any more. Part of Walking Ollie's charm is the problem that Foster faces in his attempts to establish a modus vivendi between man and dog. Ollie is enuretic. More disturbing, at least to me, he fails to recognise rabbits as things that must be pursued. My mother used to say: ""There are no bad dogs, only bad owners."" On the same principle, I believe that canine neurosis is a transmittable disease, caught from human beings. Foster's difficulties can be explained by reference to the first six words on page 117, ""As a break from university stress . . ."" His problem is not the stress. It is the university. He over-intellectualises what should be an emotional relationship. Owning a dog is not easy - particularly a dog of character. Friends of mine occasionally look after a greyhound which was rescued by their daughter. When I first saw it, I was astonished (since they are persons of discretion) by what I believed to be a huge pottery dog in the living room. It did not move for an hour. Better by far to have such a dog than no dog at all. But better still to have a dog like Ollie. He is trouble. But he is also a joy. So is reading about him. Walking Ollie is the best book about a dog for . . . let us say eight years."
8,"A Question of Honour by Lord Michael Levy  Simon &amp; Schuster £18.99, pp320 A long life in politics is, inevitably, punctuated with regrets. I now must add to my failure to lead the Labour party or hold one of the great offices of state the comforting words which I spoke to Lord Levy during an afternoon at the height of the 'honours for sale' controversy. No doubt the Metropolitan Police were right to conclude, as I thought at the time, that Tony Blair's fund-raiser-in-chief had no case to answer. But if disloyalty was an indictable offence, he would spend the rest of his life in Wormwood Scrubs - convicted of writing a deplorable autobiography. The only possible plea in mitigation is that Levy damages himself more than he damages others. For the rest of his life he will be the man who whined that at 'his farewell gala dinner ... although Tony publicly praised and thanked a number of people who had helped him become Prime Minister and govern Britain, he made no mention of me.' In his own defence, Levy would no doubt say that confidences are no longer kept and that we live in an age of self-serving and highly remunerative revelations. But other autobiographies, reprehensible though they may be, can at least claim that they teach us something about the business of government or the pressures at the top of politics. All we learn from what is billed as 'the truth about the cash for peerage scandal' is tittle tattle. Everything of significance in the chapter on Labour party loans and gifts has already been published, in one form or another - except for the insistence that the 'decision to take loans was made by the Prime Minister in his capacity as leader of the Labour party', not by his above-reproach tennis partner. Had it not been for Blair, Levy would never have been much more than the man who managed Alvin Stardust. He has repaid his benefactor for all those photographs with the great and good - no doubt, even now, displayed on a grand piano - with a series of nasty, niggling little anecdotes. Levy tells us that, having promised Robin Cook that he would remain Foreign Secretary for a year after the 2001 general election, the Prime Minister changed his mind and replaced him with Jack Straw at the beginning of the new parliament. The story is true and Robin was certainly both disappointed and distressed by the decision. But what is to be gained by regurgitating the details now - except the possibility that the account of how Levy was employed to persuade Cook to accept demotion demonstrates that, for a moment, he was on the inside track? The story only illustrates how foolish Blair was to take Levy into his confidence. Indeed the most interesting question provoked by the whole 300 pages is why the Prime Minister became involved with such a person. What a relief to read that Murray Elder, John Smith's confidant and Gordon Brown's long-time friend, was not as susceptible to Levy's charms as Blair became. The most unpleasant passages of the book were, naturally, highlighted in the recent serialisation. But the nonsense about Levy - in the capacity of candid friend - warning Blair about his long massage sessions with Carole Caplin and the absurd account of Cherie Blair asking for advice about her husband's reliance on Anji Hunter, his long-time 'gate keeper' (with a side swipe at Fiona Millar, Alastair Campbell's partner), are not the quintessential passages of this farrago of innuendo and smear. That accolade goes to the passage describing the decision to transfer the Labour party's public-relations account from Hobsbawm Macaulay to another company. Gordon Brown's wife was a partner in the rejected firm. But Brown 'never raised the issue at the time and (Levy had) no reason to believe that he harboured any lasting resentment'. So why put the possibility in the reader's mind? As an attempt to wound without striking, or being seen to strike, it takes some beating, Tony Blair receives similar treatment. 'What is T.B. in it for? What does T.B. want out of it? Is T.B. just in it for himself?' Of course Levy never asks such questions. He just warns that they are being asked by others. Indeed he regards Blair as a 'really good man, trying to do really good things for the country'. But he chooses to embarrass and damage him with the revelation of attitudes and events that a real friend would regard as confidential. He remains devoted to the Labour party. But he harms its chances of re-election with assertions that Blair does not believe that Brown can beat David Cameron. It all adds up to a book which has only one merit. Its author has a sense of humour. Levy calls his memoir A Question of Honour."
8,"Black Diamonds: The Rise and Fall of an English Dynasty  by Catherine Bailey  544pp, Viking, &pound;20 If books had human characteristics, Black Diamonds would suffer from a severe identity crisis. It begins with the mystery - written in the high romantic style of Baroness Orczy - of the seventh Earl Fitzwilliam's origins and the allegation that he was a changeling, smuggled into a Canadian log cabin to provide the heir that Lavinia, Lady Middleton, could not produce. It ends with the tragedy - written in the breathless prose of Elinor Glyn - of Katherine ""Kick"" Kennedy (JFK's sister), who married the Marquis of Hartington and, after his death in the war, became entangled with the disreputable eighth Earl Fitzwilliam and died with him in an air crash. In between the extracts from the social register, Black Diamonds contains a great deal of worthwhile information and interesting analysis about the state of affairs in and about Wentworth House and its estate. Catherine Bailey contrasts the lavish lifestyle of the Fitzwilliam-Wentworths with the grinding poverty of the miners whose sweat paid for the aristocratic extravagance. But not even the worthy meat in the sandwich is left unblemished by the book's regularly recurring flaw. The language in which some of the serious passages are written reduces its best parts to the level of society gossip. It is bad enough that the chapter on the doomed affair between Kennedy and the eighth Earl Fitzwilliam Wentworth is heralded by the single sentence, ""The affair seemed madness from the start."" But the real offence is the ""bogus reporting"" which peppers the chapters on important social questions. The visit of George V to Wentworth - meant to heal some of the wounds of the industrial upheavals of 1911 by producing newspaper pictures of the king with miners - was an important indication of the establishment's anxiety about the prospects of a general strike or worse. Black Diamonds deals with it adequately. But it is preceded by a description of the king's arrival which would be more appropriate to the beginning of a short story in Lady's Home Journal. ""Walking briskly through the corridors, the housekeeper missed nothing. From time to time she stopped to adjust the arrangements in the vases of flowers or to knead the bowls of potpourri to release their aroma into the air."" The irritation caused by such flaws is increased by the way in which they diminish the chapters of Black Diamonds that have something sensible, and sometimes important, to say. The verbatim accounts of the miners' attitude to what south Yorkshire called ""graft"" - not corruption but back-breaking labour - has an air of absolute authenticity. Walter Brierley, a miner from a pit 40 miles from Wentworth who was unemployed for four years, longed to be back hewing coal. ""The dependence on the state for money without having honestly earned it has made me creep within myself."" Arthur Eaglestone remembered: ""The most heinous of accusations lay in the terrible phrase 'He doesn't like work'."" When Bailey stops writing like a romantic novelist, Black Diamonds admirably reflects both the true nobility of the inter-war miners and the undoubted degradation of the aristocracy who exploited them."
10,"Globalisation and Its Discontents<br />by Joseph Stiglitz<br />304pp, Allen Lane, £16.99 Up the Down Escalator: Why the Global Pessimists Are Wrong<br />by Charles Leadbeater<br />384pp, Viking, £17.99 The rise and fall of Joseph Stiglitz is one of the telling parables of our age. One of the world's great economists - he won the Nobel Prize in 2001 for his elegant demonstrations that markets necessarily work imperfectly, on any reasonable assumption that market participants are not all knowledgeable - he is also not afraid to get his hands dirty in the world of policy-making. President Clinton made him chair of his Council of Economic Advisers, but not before he had given some wise advice to the Chinese about how to go about liberalising their economy. China, unlike Russia which took a more overtly free-market path, has been chalking up double-digit growth rates ever since. The development of the world's poorest countries was always closest to Stiglitz's heart, so when James Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, offered him the job as its chief economist in 1997 - as part of an attempt to carve out a different approach to third-world development - he jumped at the chance. Wolfensohn wanted to create a more rounded approach - stressing the role of education (particularly of women), disease prevention and good governance in the development process - rather than the so-called Washington consensus of simply privatising, deregulating and instantaneously opening up fragile economies to free trade and free finance. Stiglitz seemed to be the man with the intellectual authority and connections within the Clinton administration to help him. But it didn't work out like that. Stiglitz arrived at the bank as the US was moving into what we now know was a phoney boom, but which had made the conservative economic intellectuals, who claimed authorship of it, extraordinarily hubristic. Their market-fundamentalist ideas, they supposed, were wholly right, and they insisted on them being implemented internationally, through what had become an arm of the US treasury - the IMF. Stiglitz vainly campaigned against what he saw as ridiculous, self-defeating and enormously damaging policies - allowing his feelings to surface too openly in public. Stiglitz was acknowledged, even by his critics, as one of the world's best economists. But he dared to cross the high priests of conservative international finance in their pomp. He was marginalised and briefed against, and his position was made insupportable. Finally, three years later, he resigned. Stiglitz's return to the groves of academia is a salutary lesson about where power lies in today's world. The kernel of Globalisation and Its Discontents is his account of those years at the World Bank and his arguments with the IMF and US Treasury, and as such is a massively important political as well as economic document. That Joseph Stiglitz could not survive - even before the arrival of the Bush administration - tells you all you need to know about the chances of a more sane economics re-entering the American discourse. It is also a sharp reproach to the boyish, almost glib optimism of   Charles Leadbeater's Up the Down Escalator - an account of globalisation as naive as Stiglitz's is sophisticated. In a sense, Leadbeater epitomises the scale of the opposition that a rational economist like Stiglitz confronts. He is not a man of the right, and for all his neglect of economics, political economy and the realities of international finance and realpolitik that Stiglitz describes, he is a well-intentioned and skilled cultural commentator. I found the first 100 pages of his book, in which he reframes all the current political and cultural arguments as one - at heart - between pessimists and optimists, original and entertaining. Cultural pessimism does unite, say, a Daily Mail worldview and anti-globalisers alike. And while the rest turns into a relentless, rather dull Panglossian account of why globalisation, technology and science are all good for us, so that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds - even the anti-globalisation movement, you see, is part of the debate that will make globalisation still better - it is useful to have our very own Pangloss in our midst. It shows the limitations of the creed, while offering a useful counterweight to too much gloom. Doubtless Leadbeater would categorise Stiglitz as a pessimist - but a useful pessimist, in that his contributions to the debate will only make the world, already very good, even better. Globalisation is creating so much opportunity and wealth, and we are already so far advanced in the creation of an environment that reflects our own wishes and aspirations, that everyone is welcome to take part in the tumultuous exchange of ideas. Leadbeater, a former Marxist, sees everything as part of a benign, Hegelian dialectic in which any contribution only serves the general march of progress. Yet as Stiglitz would reply, the world is not so benign, nor the march of progress so inevitable. It has to be fought for - with weapons more powerful and fundamental than optimism alone. He watched, largely helpless, as the IMF and US treasury, in a kind of institutional and intellectual lockstep, imposed needless suffering on millions of ordinary people in East Asia and Russia through free-market ""shock"" programmes, forcing massive economic adjustment, centring on making countries keep their financial systems as open as possible to inflows and outflows of private capital. This was the result not just of bad economics but, as Stiglitz tells it, a redefinition of the IMF's role. Its intellectual father was Keynes, who argued for the creation of a global institution that could take global collective action because markets can fail. Its role was to ensure that, unlike in the 1930s when global demand fell away disastrously, there would be a global mechanism to keep demand up by allowing countries an orderly framework in which they could maintain full employment. They could borrow from the IMF when they needed to, rather than resorting to crash programmes of deflation or beggaring their neighbour through trade protection. The view of international finance - that its interests should come first - was firmly refuted. Instead it had to play by the rules of the game set up to establish a global interest. But now a new doctrine holds: what the financial community views as good for the global economy is good for the global economy and should be done. The IMF has become the servant of the financial system it used to shape. Stiglitz explains this change as having essentially three causes. First there is no longer an intellectual belief that markets fail. Secondly, the IMF has been allowed to become poorer as faith in government nationally and internationally has dwindled, so it has had to enlist the support of the great international banks when it lends to countries in trouble - and they have very particular interests. They want to get their money into and out of all countries as freely as possible, and are thus always advocates of ""financial deregulation"" - so that this always plays an overwhelming part in any support the IMF provides. And because countries have to borrow in dollars, the interests and preoccupations of American banks and the US Treasury have become paramount - reinforcing the bias to make countries bend the knee to the interests of Wall Street rather than full employment, growth and the maintenance of their social contracts. There has never been official recognition of this fundamental change of policy, but Stiglitz draws attention to how key personnel switch from Wall Street to the IMF and back again - having served the financial community's interests well. Stan Fischer, for example, deputy managing director of the IMF, went directly to become a vice-chairman of the vast international bank Citigroup. ""One could only ask,"" writes Stiglitz, ""Was Fischer being richly rewarded for having faithfully executed what he was told to do?"" It's a pertinent question. If the 1930s were characterised by beggar-my-neighbour policies, the 1990s have been characterised by what Stiglitz describes as beggar-myself policies - all to promote Wall Street and the US Treasury's aim of creating one single global financial market in which the over-riding concern of every government is to keep its financial system open to international finance, whatever the domestic cost. Those at the top have benefited hugely, while creating a system that is massively unfair - not to mention its volatility and extraordinary capacity to transmit economic shocks simultaneously across the globe without any check. Stiglitz finishes his book with seven action points for change. He is not a global pessimist, but a realist - and instead of placing him in a neat box labelled ""important contribution to the debate"", we should listen to him urgently. The biggest indictment of Leadbeater, and those like him, is that they make it harder for us to hear, and to act, on what Stiglitz is saying."
10,"The first problem with this book is its title. There is no prospect of China ruling the world. This is a country whose uncertainties of identity and economic frailties prevent it from ever projecting hegemonic hard and soft power. Its authoritarian institutions, far from being a source of strength, are a source of weakness. China is simultaneously big but poor, powerful but weak. And there, until wholesale political change occurs, it will stay, notwithstanding its considerable growth rates and economic achievement. Indeed, its current economic model, dependent on high exports and mountainous savings, is disintegrating, as both insiders and close observers recognise."
10,"The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein  Penguin £25, pp560 Naomi Klein is confused. She has written a tough attack on capitalism's capacity to insist that public policy be run wholly in its own interests and its conspiratorial capacity to capitalise on all forms of disaster and social distress to get its way. Fine. 'Disaster capitalism' is an insightful way of looking at how the free marketeers have spread the gospel. Sometimes you cheer her on, but nowhere does she concede that markets can have good results as well as bad. Nowhere does she explore what those circumstances may be and why economic freedom is so appealing to so many. And nowhere does she set out an alternative manifesto for running economies and societies. In her delusional, Manichaean world view, privatisation, free markets, private property, consumer freedom, the profit motive and economic freedom are just other terms for corporate self-enrichment, denial of voice, limitation of citizenship, inequality and, sometimes, even torture. The discredited electro-shock psychological treatment of the Fifties, we learn, informed the thought system of the free marketeers; it is guilt by association and assertion rather than proof, a weaknesses of too much of the book. Nothing good can ever come from globalisation, which is just more capitalism. Democracy, however, is a halcyon world of political and economic co-operation, citizen voice and engagement, with a freely arrived- at assertion of the common interest in which most think along the same lines as, say, Naomi Klein. She and free-market economist Milton Friedman, whom she has in her sights, are mirror images of each other in the absolutist categories in which they think. So she is unlikely to convince anybody new, which is a pity, because she does hit some bull's eyes. Her description of the way corporate America has exploited the disasters of hurricane Katrina, 9/11, the Iraq war and even the 2005 tsunami is devastating. The natural disaster that destroyed tens of thousands of lives in New Orleans was seen as an 'opportunity' to put the city's schooling and public housing in private hands. 9/11 became the excuse for the creation of a vast, private-security industry. And the Iraq war was organised around the idea that following the shock and awe military strategy, the country could be organised as a pure, free-market paradise, partly because country and people alike were so traumatised that they would offer no opposition and partly because of the ideological belief that only unalloyed markets could deliver results. It was in Iraq that disaster capitalism had its purest, most self-destructive impact. Her account of the ideological zealotry, stupidity and greed that informed how Iraqi reconstruction was handled is among the most original and revealing in the book. The ambition to have low taxes, minimal regulation, no state, free markets, low tariffs and maximum corporate involvement because they conformed to the free-market blueprint distorted economic priorities and generated huge opportunities for waste and racketeering. Worse, they involved a scorched-earth policy towards Iraqi institutions that created the vacuum occupied by the sectarian, murderous militias. It was the true denouement of disaster capitalism. There are many lessons from Iraq, but they elude Klein. The fact that the neocons were wedded to an economistic and wrong view of democracy does not mean that the left should be automatically against all forms of market and conceive of democracy as a surrogate for socialism. Rather, democracy is shorthand for a network of painfully constructed institutions: a free press, free unions, an independent legal and judicial system, the rule of law, the capacity to whistleblow, audit trails, transparency of decision taking, political parties, constitutional checks and balances to hold executive government to account, local power and free elections. When capitalism works well, these institutions are well-functioning. But they are more important than even that. Paradoxically, successful capitalism depends on the integrity it brings to the operation of markets and the organisation of corporations. What was wrong about so much shock therapy and the brutal introduction of markets that Klein describes was not that societies should have cleaved to a quasi-socialist alternative under the rubric of democracy. It was that they should have paid infinitely more attention to the building of the 'soft' institutions of democracy, including universal education and health care, as the vital precondition for successful markets. She does not recognise it, but the debate has moved on since the bad old days of the 'Washington consensus'. Some of the economists she eviscerates, such as Harvard's Dani Rodrik, have become leaders in building a new consensus that acknowledges the importance of such institutions and are no less tough on how the reconstruction of Iraq neglected them. It does not suit her case, hence no mention. Klein is so anxious to prove that all capitalism is bad, even, on occasion, relying on torture to get its way, that she never allows for the possibility that markets can deliver beneficial results. Or that the demand for markets comes from the bottom up, as it did in China between 1980 and 1983. Nor, in her account of the shock treatment of the former communist Eastern Europe, does she explain why some countries - the Baltic republics and the Czech Republic - have done so much better than others. So The Shock Doctrine is a lost opportunity. It is hardly new that disasters and shocks are often triggers of change; her insight is to apply the thesis to turbo-capitalism and its ideologues. If Klein had been fairer, she would have had a smarter thesis that could genuinely have changed the intellectual climate. As it is, she will be dismissed by her critics as a confused ranter. We need critics of free-market fundamentalism to do better than that."
11,"A Complicated Kindness is the story of Nomi, a brilliantly acute, confused, generous-spirited 16-year-old growing up in a Mennonite community some miles from Winnipeg. Its author, Miriam Toews, was raised in just such a place, and got out as fast as she humanly could (the day after graduating from high school). The narrative voice is so strong, it could carry the least eventful, least weird adolescence in the world and still be as transfixing, but the fact is, this community is compellingly strange. The shorthand for Mennonite is ""like Amish, only in Canada"" (there's a large Mennonite community in the US, too, but that rather spoils the analogy) - Nomi gives the terse specifics in the opening pages of the book: ""We're Mennonites. As far as I know, we are the most embarrassing sub-sect of people to belong to if you're a teenager ... A Mennonite telephone survey might consist of questions like, would you prefer to live or die a cruel death, and if you answer 'live' the Menno doing the survey hangs up on you. Imagine the least well-adjusted kid in your school starting a breakaway clique of people whose manifesto includes a ban on the media, dancing, smoking, temperate climates, movies, drinking, rock'n'roll, having sex for fun, swimming, make-up, jewellery, playing pool, going to cities, or staying up past nine o'clock. That was Menno all over.""  Mennonite diktats express a deeply-held horror of almost all aspects of modern life. Emphasis on ""plain"" dress means that, in some households, even buttons and zips are a sign of inadequate faith. Ownership of a Janis Joplin record is the most direct known route to hell, apart from all those millions of other routes. Literature is an irreligious diversion; indeed, the life of the mind outside worship is utterly abrogated. Toews's experience was by no means the full Mennonite monty. ""My parents both had masters degrees, they were educated, so it was a very tolerant, liberal family within the grander scheme of things. We were allowed to read."" Yet she recalls, in all the time she grew up, going to see only one film (Tom Sawyer): ""I remember us all sitting there, sitting up really straight. And nearly fainting when the lights went down.""   This faith sprang up as a frond of the Europe-wide radical religious ferment of the 16th century. In tenets, it is closest to Anabaptism, though there is also a Calvinistic tang to its competitive holiness. (Calvin believed that ascension to heaven was predetermined - your actions made no difference: you were either part of the elect or you weren't. And yet, a good sign that you were a member of the elect was the righteousness of your behaviour. So, unlike traditional Christianity, where there is a set of rules and you strive to live by them, this thinking compelled followers constantly to be finding new rules, the better to emphasise that they were inexorably heaven-bound.) Menno differed from the Anabaptists in his belief in law and order (Anabaptists loved to riot). This didn't stop him being persecuted, or his followers fleeing all over Europe (mainly to Russia), but it did mean that once they found a place where they could be tolerated (Canada, and parts of central America), their societies remained curiously static, since they posed no structural threat to mainstream society and were therefore never forced by clash or friction to adapt to new times.   Toews's novel is a wonderfully acute, moving, warm, sceptical, frustrated portrait of fundamentalist religion. Besides the fervent sanctimony, Mennonite communities are wilfully antique and retrogressive - they have lifestyle museums where regular Canadians and Americans turn up to point at the teenagers churning milk while trussed up in elaborately drab bonnetry. It sounds weird and rather sinister, like a petting zoo where the animals have opposable thumbs. Nothing expresses the falsity of the olde worlde parade better than an episode in the book where Nomi sets fire to her bonnet while having a sneaky fag and has to be dunked in some kind of rainwater barrel by a tourist. It's hilarious. The relationship between mainstream Canadians and the Mennonite communities is skewed - Toews says, ""We were this quaint little society, charming, fun, kids go there for field trips the whole time. My own kids have been there. It's all very picturesque and simple. But it is a way of dehumanising Mennonites. It's not serious evil. But you'll hear people sitting at a table talking about Mennonites, 'Yeah, I was doing business with one of them', and others going, 'Really? They do  business?' There is that level of patronisation - is that a word? - that Mennonites experience all the time. But then they set up these museums to make money. They give people the horse and buggy because it's a money-spinner.""   Toews grew up in just such a town herself - the events described in the book, she says wryly, are entirely fictitious, but much of the texture is located in her own early life. ""I was very conscious of making sure that my character's relationships with the community were authentic. Mine were something else entirely. Obviously. But the emphasis in the town on punishment and shame, and joylessness, that degree of severity and intolerance - all those aspects I certainly experienced.""   I get the impression that Toews's actual response to the absurd and abundant strictures was pretty close to her heroine's, but the defining events of the work, the desertion of Nomi's mother and older sister, are very clearly fictional. Toews was the first in her own family to quit the town of Steinbach, on which the fictional East Village is kind-of-yet-not-exactly based. (Toews says vaguely that the places have similarities. Though when I met her friend Reverend Moon (not the Moonies one), who thought - mistakenly, it turned out - that he would be passing through Steinbach on his way to pick up his son from Bible camp the next day, he said, ""Why don't you come along? You can see all the places from the book!"") Her older sister left two years after her, and her mother remained there until the suicide of her father six years ago. And there are elements of the protagonist's character - an immensely strong bond of care and duty to her father, her terminally ill friend, the needy next-door child, above all a precocious and touching selflessness - that Toews herself is far too humble to appropriate.   Toews realised she had to leave with a certainty and urgency that surprises me, because she doesn't seem anything like strident or abrasive enough to alienate anyone, not even religious nut-nuts. She reminds me a bit of Mia Farrow in Hannah And Her Sisters: laconic, fine-boned, slightly undefended, wearing her perspicacity and intelligence very discreetly. Upon leaving Steinbach, she travelled all over the place: to Montreal, to London on an exchange programme, working her way round to Europe on wages from a job in a bakery in Finsbury Park, north London. She took a film studies degree at the University of Manitoba, then moved to Halifax to study journalism, before settling in Winnipeg 12 years ago, when she was 28. It's a city of bafflingly broad streets and meticulous town planning. It used to be called the Chicago of the north, though isn't any more; it seems faded and contradictory. Most of the time, it feels like a warm, leftie, Bohemian utopia (that's a figurative ""warm""; it's bloody freezing most of the year).   Unfailingly, wherever you go with Toews (it's pronounced ""taves""), she meets people she knows, whose habits and interests she also knows, who congratulate her on the book, which, besides being so good, has also made a big noise. And she says, ""Oh, well, you know ... How's Emerice?"" trying to deflect the flattery, for sure, but also far more interested in people's daughters and aunts and such than in her own success. Winnipeg's the kind of place where it's very easy to find a vegan meal and very hard to get tickets to see Fahrenheit 9/11 unless you book a long time in advance. But, at the same time, there are more bridal shops than bars, which must be the best index of borderline depression a place could give you (you know, 18-year-olds feverishly trying to hold on to each other, rather than just getting drunk and seeing what happens). And the liberal pleasantries coexist with a disturbingly quiet racial tension, where all the tramps are Native Canadians, and Toews's neighbour's foster son was recently beaten to death in a car park. (Mind you, while I was marvelling at Canada's rotten underbelly, someone was shot in the face outside my local, so I'm not one to cast the first stone.)   The point is, though, while Winnipeg in no way approximates the isolation and rigidity of a Mennonite town, neither is it the farthest away from one you could possibly travel. It's only about 70 miles away, to start with, and shares the spookily uniform terrain. This area is -40C in winter, plagued by mosquitoes in the summer. Actually, the bugs probably aren't so bad, and cold you can protect yourself against, but the landscape is vastly, oppressively flat. You can fly from Minnesota to Winnipeg without seeing a single geographical feature, just endless, even fields, riven by the occasional correction line where the horizon interferes with the 90-degree arrangement of the boundaries. If you weren't used to it, it would drive you loopy. It is a characteristic of Mennonite communities that they congregate in places no one else would want to live; hard-core followers have formed enclaves in the most inhospitable bits of Paraguay.   Geography aside, Winnipeg is urban enough to be a breeze - albeit quite a strong one - compared with the farther outreaches of Manitoba (the state of which it is capital). Toews lives around the corner from her mother and sister, and there is a constant traffic of family members through her house. She still calls herself a Mennonite, yet calls herself agnostic at the same time. Alongside the Mennonite intolerance and peculiarity, the book draws a community of, well, enormous community spirit. ""I remember a very nurturing, safe environment, everybody knew who I was, who my parents were, who my grandparents were, what part of Russia we were from originally. That was a really comforting feeling. Non-Mennonites, when they see that aspect of it, think it's a beautiful thing, and it is, but there's so much going on besides. So people who leave, people like me - and there are lots of us, especially in this town - have very complicated relationships with the places we grew up. We want to love them, and we do love them, but there's so much of it that's so harsh, so unforgiving.""    Her life is shot through with this ambivalence. Many of her decisions have been taken along traditional Mennonite lines - she had children young (she was 22 when she had Owen; now she's 40, and her youngest, Georgia, is 14). She loves being a mother and has a fierce sense of family. ""You know, these sacrifices you make of time and energy to raise your children properly, I wouldn't spend it any other way."" And yet, to a religion run along patriarchal lines, where ""a 15-year-old boy can stand up and preach, but a 75-year-old woman who's borne 13 children can't"", the very fact of her assuming any kind of right to artistic self-expression, before you even consider how critical the book is of Mennonite ways, would have been enough, had she stayed in the fold, to spark one of those bizarre public shunnings where some or other miscreant is ejected from the church. This is substantially more life-changing than being barred from your local pub, say. While you could remain in town, it would be very difficult to make a living. It would be unlikely for anyone to talk to you. It sounds extremely Breaking The Waves.  In other ways, though, Toews's agnostic side shows itself in her pretty regular family set-up, which she describes in an endearingly abashed tone of voice. ""I had my first kid as I was completing my BA. And, well, no, I wasn't married, see. I've only just recently got married, four years ago, in Vegas, because Georgia thought it would be a good idea. So I had Owen with this one guy, who has just disappeared - apparently he lives in Tokyo now. So I have to deal with this whole men-disappearing syndrome. But then I hooked up with another guy - oh, this sounds bad - but we're very happily together, we've been together for 16 years, and he adopted Owen and then we had Georgia together."" It's funny, because Toews has a rounded, self-critical, open-minded, human kind of morality that amounts to what the best of people live by; and yet, at the same time, you get a whiff of the strictness of her upbringing, an intimation that the spectre of Menno once in a blue moon intercedes and chews her out. She maintains that, had she been writing a factual essay about the Mennonites, she would have been far more critical and damning than her protagonist ever is. But it's ambiguous: there's a lot of complicated fondness there. Which isn't to say that she hasn't, ultimately, come down on the side of Winnipeg liberalism. Her children weren't raised as semi-Mennonites (""Kind of Menno-lite?"" she says. ""No. Not at all. My mum would take them to church on the sly. It was like, 'Quick, your parents are hungover, let's go'."") ""There are so many things in my life that would be completely not on within the conservative church. And yet I think of myself as a reasonably decent human being. With all sorts of flaws, you know, but still reasonably decent. If I did believe in heaven and hell, I would really, honestly, believe I was going to go to heaven.""   The complexity of distancing oneself from one's formative faith is redoubled when the community is comically inbred (as Nomi remarks wryly, ""Our gene pool has no deep end""). Doctrines can be rejected in a way that genetic legacy can't. Well, up to a point - if you all share the same chin, that's something you could handle, but there seems to be a melancholic streak running through this faith that can neither be ignored, nor wholly distinguished from the faith itself. While she was at the University of Manitoba, her philosophy tutor was discussing a young Mennonite who'd gone to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship. ""It turns out he was a cousin of mine. Of course. Right. He came from a very strict family and just couldn't handle the sudden freedom, the drugs, the sex, the total openness, the anything-goes attitude. And it's suspected that he killed himself, or that he overdosed on drugs. It doesn't matter how intelligent or academically inclined he was, the culture shock was still too huge.""  This is instructive not just in the sense that you can't mention a Mennonite to any other without it transpiring they're related. Toews's family is scarred by suicide. She lost her father when, having suffered from manic depression since he was 17, he threw himself in front of a train. She wrote Swing Low, a factual account of his life and illness, in 2001, to great acclaim. Another, much closer cousin also killed herself. Perhaps all families, were they to stay close enough to track each other, would find a pattern this brutal, but I doubt it - besides, most families simply aren't inbred to this degree and never have to consider that the isolated temperament of their forefather might be echoing down through centuries.   That gives an impression of what it's like to be an ex-Mennonite, or a semi-Mennonite, or a ""liberal"" Mennonite that is way too bleak properly to describe Toews or her family. Her husband, Neil, was also raised a Mennonite, though not in the most rigid, conventional way. Neil's relationship with his branch of the Menno clan (the two families' names are Harder and Dix. Well, it made us laugh, and they must have been laughing over it for years) is distinctly different from Miriam's - they go to family reunions and such, but he has no nostalgia for the religion itself. He laughingly says they were nasty, money-grubbing people (certain Mennonites, this is, not his family), with a verifiable record of peddling drugs to the faithless as a business venture. This does sound unpleasant - even though the net result is the same, it's way more cynical when people spin cash out of a vice that they specifically disavow. But this has to be set against a long record of humanitarian aid - many of the families who sponsored immigrants, notably Vietnamese boat people, were Mennonites, and the religion has a tradition of supporting foreign communities with money and medicine.   It's not all peaches, in other words, but peaches exist, within reason. And Miriam's mother, Elvira, has a different perspective still. (She's a brilliant raconteur, and extremely supportive of the book, especially considering that its central event is the mother's desertion and she's had people ask if it's a true story. When she lives round the corner from both her daughters!) Having left Steinbach, Elvira is still a Mennonite and attends their church in Winnipeg. She gets the magazine, which has headlines such as Your Only Way To Heaven Is To Understand And Admit That You Are A Complete Failure. And yet, again, she is ambivalent about the community in which she spent her adult life. Or, rather, she is bemused at how little she misses it. She never visits; she finds this perplexing but not distressing.   But then, of course there would be multiple perspectives. Toews's work never claimed to be a definitive portrait of the right-thinking response to anything. It is a work of fiction and, while the peculiarities of the environment give it its flesh and structure, the beauty of it is all in the prose, which is so sensitively and delicately balanced that the most caustic humour and poignant act of love can coexist in the same line. It reminds me a bit of George Saunders's Pastoralia, to which Toews replied very warmly, ""Oh, he's brilliant. And very nice.""   ""Is he a friend of yours?""   ""No, but he returned an email my friend sent him. Which I thought was really nice of him.""   The impossibility of writing without humour consigned Toews for a long time to the comedy circuit. She won countless humorist prizes for her first two novels, which she's keen to point out she was very grateful for, before adding, ""The British are actually a lot more appreciative of the comic. In Canada, if you're perceived as a comic writer, there's a real snobbery and you can't be serious. You're not a big hitter.""   Her favourite authors are ""British men, mainly - Irvine Welsh, James Kelman, Patrick McCabe"". There's a lot of courtesy here, though; I wouldn't put it past her to be just saying that to make me feel welcome, or so that I would have read them and so not feel stupid. I mean, I'm sure she does like them, I just bet there are some Americans or Canadians or, who knows, a whole host of other nationals whom she likes as well.   Toews's next book is currently just a series of impressions, nowhere near finished, lacking a basic structure of any kind, she says, frowningly, as if she'd forgotten for a while that there was something she really ought to be getting on with and had suddenly remembered. ""I have a problem with beginnings ... and endings ... and middles. But I don't know what else I would do. I find it very, very difficult to write. It takes everything, it's physically and mentally and emotionally exhausting for me. And my neighbours. And my dog.""   It never shows, the exhaustion. The book is fascinating, and resonant, and inexorable - but then, it's like trapeze, isn't it? That's the way this stuff is supposed to work"
11,"DBC Pierre, Booker Prize-winner and author of Vernon God Little, has moved to Ireland. The first rule of interviewing people in Ireland, before ""Wear thermal pants"" and ""Remember some euros"", is this: if they're a writer, an artist or a composer, they're there for the tax break. It irks me when these literary bad boys (especially Michel Houellebecq, who used to call himself a sodding communist) uproot themselves just, it seems fair to assume, to avoid a basic system of sharing stuff that your average apolitical cabbie seems able to manage. It irks me still further when they won't admit it. ""No, no, no,"" says Dirty But Clean (that's what his initials stand for). ""No. In the first instance, it was because I was in south London, and with the advance from Vernon I thought I should make something of it. I did, slowly, pay back my creditors. But I had to move somewhere I could afford to buy a place, and not fritter the rest of it in Soho."" Not tax-related at all? ""No. Also, in Balham, the property boom spread from Clapham, and people started getting really uptight. The neighbours started getting really antsy."" Apparently, they complained when he shuffled about in the night. But did you have any friends in Ireland? ""Well, no."" The day he was leaving London was the first day they had parking restrictions on his street. ""I'd left the car with the front wheels over the line, and went off to sleep. I woke up, and of course the car was gone. They'd towed it and given it to the mafia that runs that car-towing scam, and I had to go down and pay a fuckload of money. So I got the car, and said, 'I'm out of here.' Got to the place where I now live, put the car maybe half a kilometre up the road, and took a photograph of it, intending to send it to the car parking mafia, with a letter saying, 'Come and get it now, you cunts.' Until finally I thought, 'This is silly. Why am I being like this?' I really had city fever. I needed to get to the countryside. It's odd, because I was raised in the city, but I needed to get out of it."" I still don't buy it, not a word, and I can't bear the Tory implications of having a go at a car pound, but I'm really having to force myself to bring it up, because the truth is DBC Pierre is the most ludicrously charming individual. He is exactly as charming as you'd have to be to do people out of tens of thousands of pounds (as he once did) without recourse to a shotgun. He reminds me of that speech in Pulp Fiction where Samuel L Jackson explains why pigs are filthy and dogs aren't. ""I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they are definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality; personality goes a long way."" ""So, by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?"" ""Well, we'd have to be talking one charming motherfucking pig."" DBC might be dirty, in other words, but he's too charming to be filthy. I know this isn't brain fever brought on by the landscape (which, in Leitrim, where he now lives for un-tax-related reasons, is daunting and lovely): people like this guy. He's sitting outside a shabby little bar with an unopened bottle of Martel. His face is pink with cold (you have to smoke outdoors in Ireland). I can't work out whether this is his weekly shop, and it includes only brandy. Or whether he's done the maths and figured that, for the amount of brandy he intends to drink right now, he might as well buy a whole bottle. Or whether it's brandy from home, and he couldn't leave it unattended because he had a delinquent staying with him. So it seems reasonable enough to ask, ""Why have you got that?"" ""They gave it to me."" ""Why?"" ""It's a present."" ""For what?"" ""For Christmas."" Never mind that it's January - they must love him. When DBC Pierre won the Booker Prize in 2003, there was something dodgy about him on every conceivable level. The Daily Telegraph headlined his victory, ""Reformed cocaine addict is &pound;50,000 Booker winner."" The Guardian reported, ""Repentant rogue wins over Booker Prize judges"" (more old-world charm to that, I feel). You can't throw a stick without hitting an ex-junkie in the literary world, but Pierre was much more than just a former cocaine addict: a con artist and fraudster, he'd appeared in court in Australia charged with almost every minor felony connected with cash scams. Besides all that, the book had come out of nowhere, the guy had no literary credentials - even that felt like a bit of a scam. He wasn't British, and wangled eligibility for the Booker on a technicality (he was born in Australia, in 1961, and grew up in Mexico). His name wasn't even Pierre; his real name is Peter Finlay. Even his author photograph lies: in it, he looks round and red and slightly distant, like a city boy who already knows you don't have enough money to be useful to him; in the flesh, he looks lean and enigmatic. Vernon God Little, Finlay/Pierre said at the time, and he confirms it now, was in many ways autobiographical. ""Erm ... Vernon was a lot about me,"" he says with a friendly smirk. ""It was a very easy sail to put up. I had lots of wind behind me."" The story, naturally, wasn't his story: his teen protagonist is best friend to a kid who goes loopy and kills his classmates, then himself. Vernon, scapegoat for a host of adult idiocies in the aftermath of the crime, copes with stuff and amuses himself by making things up. He lies, in the most abundant and devil-may-care manner, and ultimately gets himself into trouble as serious as, possibly even more serious than, if he'd been the killer himself. It's a combination of his own mendacity and other people's stupidity that finally does for Vernon, and I suppose that this is how Finlay sees his own life. ""Fact and fiction are a real problem for me. They've been a problem in my life, and they remain a problem still, in the way that we receive supposed facts, and the way that we distinguish them from fiction. You can watch whatever - pick any sitcom - one minute, and then the news, and then some bollocks, and then a documentary, and it's an act of concentration to distinguish them. What obsessed me is that novelists spend a lot of time trying to make their fiction resonate and sound real - to give it gravity, to give it a sense of reality. And that really interested me, because I find reality as it moves very whimsical and puerile and very simplistic. I wanted to spend no time at all on issues like plausibility. It's pointless to think, as you write, 'Nobody's going to believe that.' I watch the news and I don't believe that. It's horseshit. That's so obviously a con or a lie."" In conversation, and in his work, Finlay operates best when you don't try to pin him down. In the past, as he says, he famously had a problem telling the truth. Now it's more a problem for his audience - he's put his fraudulent days behind him, paid back everyone to whom he owed money (with the exception of two people he can't find), turned over a new leaf. Still, though, he's slippery: when you try to unpick the narrative of his life, it is full of missing years, missing details, curious omissions. We know, for instance, that he grew up in Mexico City, where his parents' substantial wealth was magnified to a point of hyper-reality by the poverty of their environs. His father was a scientist, working on genetically modified crops, until he was diagnosed with a brain tumour; Finlay was 16. Both parents went to New York for his father's treatment, leaving their son technically in the care of servants, but more accurately making 10 kinds of mayhem with his friends. He started taking drugs. When he was 19, his father died, bringing to a close his insane upbringing, which accounts for so much. It accounts for his crazy accent, which is totally consistent and totally impossible to locate in time and space - it's more English than American, like a public schoolboy with a slight mid-European drawl. It accounts for his freakish relationship with money. ""Where I grew up, money came into the house in envelopes. You never went to the bank. The maids would get paid, I'd get my pocket money, that would be it. I came out of there with no sense of civic duty. In Mexico, you dealt with things as they came to your face. There was no law, and there was nothing you couldn't get away with."" In his early 20s, Finlay had his residency withdrawn (for bringing a foreign car over the border) and went first to Europe, then to Australia. ""So I came to Australia and Britain, which actually had laws and statutes and shit, and that's what fucked me up. I came out of a melting pot into a bunch of cubicles. And it dismayed me. So you bank the cheque the day before the money's in the account. How can that be a crime? Then the money doesn't show up, so that becomes a crime. I spent a lot of my Australian visit in court. Literally every week."" Whatever his creditors say, I believe him. I believe him when he says he never intended to scam anyone; most of his court appearances were for bank offences and bad cheques. I believe him when he says that he was constantly being offered personal bankruptcy and he never took it, because that would have been an admission that he'd never intended to pay these people back in the first place. Rackety characters such as Finlay, with his scrapes and his debts and his near-misses with incarceration, often sound rather romantic, and I assumed he might have some kind of attachment to this period of his life, but of course he doesn't. ""It was a very painful time, incredibly painful. It kept me down for more than a decade."" By the time he got to England in the early 1990s, he had been through the mill, and worked his only nine-to-five job, in an advertising agency. ""It didn't last long. It was in the Caribbean. It was great, but then I would have had to live in the Caribbean for ever. You miss England, because it has a proper grounded feeling ... the smell of diesel in the air."" Sure, I would miss England, but why would he, when, if he were to call anywhere home, it would be Mexico or Australia? (This is a tiny point, but it does crop up regularly, the sense that he's describing himself in terms of the person he's speaking to, using whatever information about them he has, however scant. That's probably what it means to be a charmer, I suppose.) In London, Finlay started work on Vernon God Little (before that, the only thing he'd tried to write was a radio play). The fact that his adolescence was interrupted by his father's death accounts, I think, for his very close rendition in Vernon God Little of how a teenager might think, and speak, and see things. I think it self-evident that the bereavement halted some part of his development, but he heads this off, rather gently. ""There's a romantic answer to everything, where we're prey to these energies, and there's a psychological answer - you haven't moved past this or that. And both have validity. But it's not worth doing the chase. I've had therapy in the past, mainly because it was a requirement of court, and in the end I figured it was better not to understand, because that's the engine that drives you."" This mysterious engine has now driven him to write his second novel, Ludmila's Broken English, which is about ... oh, it would be daft to tell you what it's about. It does conjoined twins, and terrorism, and the sad, postwar limbo of the formerly Soviet Caucasus; it does sex and the absence of sex; it touches briefly on music and silence and short bursts of structurally incomprehensible violence - and it is great, and rollicking, and mischievously disrespectful to the literary establishment. Finlay has said before how charmed he always is by vernacular twists of speech. In Ludmila's Broken English, this is more evident than ever: in the conjoined twins, separated at the start of the book, you can hear his fondness for English verbal quirks - ""You silly sausage"", ""bloody 'ell"". But none of it sounds quite right, in so far as it doesn't really sound English. Finlay doesn't sound as if he's closely observed or rendered this language, but as if he's pinched what isn't his, and now he's bloody well going to enjoy it. When it comes to the Caucasians, he concocts the most explosively intricate and vivid register of scatological insult and imaginative excursions on the theme of brutality, most of it sexual. ""I'm really keen to be a good writer,"" he says. ""I thought I'd come away from the comfort zone of the first person, come away from the comfort zone of it being anything to do with me, write something that could have been written at any point over the past 100 years, just in terms of its structure, stand back and not get so emotionally involved with it."" It's true that the narrative engagement is less feverish than in Vernon, but one thing that strikes me is that, in deciding to move away from his own experience, Finlay produces something closer to himself. It's great fun to read because he understands so instinctively what carries you from one page to the next; but what makes it so much more than just a page-turner is the force of his anti-authoritarianism. There's no way this book could have been written ""at any point in the past 100 years"": structurally, it is crazily ill-disciplined, and takes a very modern delight in that. Using twins as his protagonists allows Finlay to have everything both ways: the two of them have all kinds of debates - on terrorism, on society - and Finlay never has to pin himself down. It often feels as if he is trying to decipher his own views through the conduit of twins, identical in every way, except that one is liberal, the other illiberal. ""Personally, on terrorism, as everything else, I'm probably very liberal at heart, but it's unresolved. But I say this to you as a liar - I can tell better lies than any of these fuckers who get up on television and say they're going to do this or that because of terrorism. They're such flimsy and transparent people, they're much greater psychotics than me."" (To clarify, I had called his self-confidence psychotic a minute earlier. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings, but think I may have done.) ""Greater in that they're successful with it, we buy it - and that is the thing that has probably changed in me."" He means his own life as a fantasist has made him more sceptical. ""Terrorism in itself, I feel the same about. I feel we've largely invited it. But I grew up in violence; I saw a lot of death and guns when I was growing up, and that kind of thing isn't such a big deal. What I fear are the societal changes that will happen around it, rather than being blown up by anyone. I'll be pissed off if I do get blown up, though, obviously. I won't take kindly to that. At all."" From Ludmila's Broken English, I get the sense that Finlay has a very idiosyncratic idea of sex. To go back to his twins, the chief respect in which they are opposite is that one has a consuming sex drive and the other has none at all. The one with none is by far the more intelligent, the more clear-sighted, the less confused, but also totally without hope. It is as though sex is this chimera that stands between all of us and despair. Is that really how he sees it? ""I don't know. Probably not. You're only the second or third person I've heard from that's read it."" Don't you show it to your friends? ""I don't know anyone who would like it. When I finished Vernon, in the mental journal we all have of peers and friends, I couldn't think of a single person that would like it. Plus, I don't print them till they're finished. I just have them on screen. So nobody can see it."" You could invite somebody over. ""But who?"" On the matter of relationships, it strikes me as deeply curious, for a person well into adulthood, that he is able to uproot himself to a place where he knows no one, and be content. ""Well, I've had long relationships. I'm not that much of an enigma, really. I'm a bit of a loner, but I'm very gregarious. I don't have any conviction or opinion that will stand above my ability to chuck them out and have a good yarn and a beer with somebody. Because I've been so wrong. You have to understand, I've been shown in my life that I've been so wrong. Everyone tells you to trust your instincts, and to big yourself up, and go for it, and I did that and I was wrong."" There's something about his delivery, something distant and playful, that makes you constantly wonder whether he's telling you the truth. I don't know if his penitence is real. I don't even know if it's true that he got into all this debt. His most famous debt, the one that attracted all the attention when he won the Booker, was to the American painter Robert Lenton. Finlay faked a letter in Spanish, which Lenton didn't understand, in order to finagle some money out of him for a property Finlay didn't possess. But the letters Lenton's family subsequently sent to the papers, I wouldn't put it past this Dirty Pierre to have written them himself, and somehow got them posted in Newfoundland as a jape. (Lenton's daughter-in-law wrote, ""Sheathed in his tuxedo of humility and self-awareness, Finlay still refuses to acknowledge what he did"", although Lenton himself said he had no axe to grind and had forgiven him.) Finlay says his third novel is seriously depraved, and he's just trying to finish it before the new atmosphere of moral rectitude starts making demands on the literary establishment - that, I believe. But when he tells me he's writing a children's book with animals in it, I can't ever see that appearing in print, and I couldn't say whether it's because I think he's joking, or lying. I do believe the great big scar on his head came from a car accident, but he says somebody told him it looked like a bullfighting wound, and if he'd told me that, I would have believed it, too. ""This is all reconstructed, this side of my face. If you look really close, my eye has been out. The skin is discoloured. It's off my back or my arse or something. I can get people to kiss me there, and they will never know they're kissing my arse."" He could tell me the Pope had kissed his arse, and I wouldn't know if he meant his regular arse, the arse-section of his face, the regular pope, a person called Pope he'd met on his many travels, or whether he was making the whole thing up. Reading his books, it is obvious that there is an honesty and authenticity in the way Finlay writes, and in the way he relates to the world, that renders his reliability when it comes to real events more or less irrelevant. Still, I wouldn't lend him any money."
9,"We buzzed at the door of the magnificent  htel particulier  in Gaillac, just facing the abbey, and few yards from the River Tarn. Madame Pinon, the patronne, came down to welcome us and guided us up the massive winding staircase, along stone-flagged corridors, past trompe d'oeil marble alcoves, by tantalising glimpses of large cool sitting rooms, the kind where Madame Bovary wished she had spent her days, up to our own rooms, which were filled with antique furniture and big, comfortable beds. Our room had a view of the river; the children's overlooked the square.  We'd just flown in to Toulouse from London after an early start at home, so I left the family to nap while I explored the town, much of which consists of similarly superb  htels particuliers. These were huge private houses in which several generations of one wealthy family might have lived on the separate floors: grandparents, two brothers and a nephew, say, all with their own wives and children.   I popped into the wine museum (Gaillac wines are good, and better value than the more famous names in the rest of France, if not perhaps quite as wonderful as the publicity suggests: ""Gaillac, enchanter of palates since the year 1000,"" they say.) Among the very best we found was made by a Scotsman, Alan Geddes, whose dessert wine is not only much better than a cheap Sauternes, but at Fr55 for a 50cl bottle, cheaper than a cheap Sauternes as well.) There is a tasting booth in the main  place , where willing helpers offered samples of any wine you choose.   Mme Pinon had recommended two restaurants and I made reservations at the Relais de la Portanelle, which was five minutes' walk from the B&amp;B, and looked slightly more child-friendly than the competition. Indeed our first-rate dinner, including drinks,    service and two  menus enfants, was excellent and came to 490 francs, around £50 all in.   Breakfast next day was on a terrace overlooking the abbey and the Place St Michel - fresh bread, hot flaky croissants, yoghurt, fruit, and plenty of excellent coffee (why are some French hotels so mean with coffee, quite as miserly as they would be with 60-year-old armagnac?) The whole visit was a delight, and since Madame charges a mere £25 for two people, including breakfast, a very affordable delight.   Next day, we took the motorway south for a short distance back towards Toulouse, then headed off onto D roads and finally bumpy lanes without any numbers at all, until we reached  la France profonde, that mysterious, sun-baked, sleepy place which exists    everywhere and yet remains frustratingly elusive. Just when you imagine you've found  la France profonde, you hear the noise from a cement plant, or sniff a municipal tip, or spot the preliminary levelling for a new autoroute.   But Madame Fieux's place in the tiny hamlet of Montpitol is as close as you're likely to get. A lake in the distance; a stand of oak trees; cool, shaded walks, the silence shattered only by the occasional bee - it would be hard to find a more peaceful place. She showed us outside and we exclaimed at the superb panoramic view and the pretty garden. ""Not a garden,"" she said firmly,  ""un parc.""   ""Comme Versailles,"" I said merrily, a compliment which she took as no more than the garden's due.   Moments later, we were lying on loungers, gazing out at what we could see of the view through the heat haze, and Mme Fieux arrived with a tray loaded with ice-cold beer, tonic, orange juice and Coke. Again, dinner was a short distance away - a 10-minute drive - and again the full meal for four, including one of the best Gaillac wines on the list, was just a fraction over £50. Breakfast was, if anything, even finer than the day before, and taken on the terrace in front of the house. Mme Fieux could not have been friendly. She charges a little more: 400 francs for a double room and breakfast.   We had found both places in Alastair Sawday's Special Places to Stay in France, one of a series which includes volumes covering Britain, plus Spain &amp; Portugal. These guides are quite open about charging for inclusion on the grounds that the books would be prohibitively expensive if they didn't. On the other hand, Sawday says, nowhere gets in if it isn't up to his standards, though presumably the most idyllic place in the world would be excluded if the owners didn't cough up.   I have to say that we have never had a failure. Looking through the guide is like reading the leaflet which   comes with a particularly nice box of chocolates - you want to experience the lot. In France, there are converted castles, ancient farmhouses, mills, cottages, a bishop's house, townhouses, forges, bastides, hunting lodges. Some are luxurious, stuffed with antique furniture, surrounded by fine formal gardens. Others are much simpler, and the prices can be as low as £18 for two people.   We stayed at three Sawdays in Britain, though it's a measure of the turnover in the B&amp;B trade that two of them have now stopped taking in visitors. A lot of people offer B&amp;B because they imagine it's a simple means of making extra money out of rooms they don't use, and an agreeable way to meet interesting folk. Which it is, up to a point, though after a while the sheer labour of making half a dozen cooked breakfasts in the morning while the children need to be taken to school, followed by heavy-duty skivvying in the bedrooms, plus a daily linen wash (or the cost of a professional laundry) and the many   extra expenses, put a considerable dent in that money supply. People who find that a year's hard work has netted them only around £3,000 may wonder whether it's worth going on.   Those who've done it tend to say that yes, most of the guests are agreeable, and some are a joy to welcome back, but it only takes one miserable couple who wake up the house coming home at 3am, or treat you like a particularly stupid chambermaid, or leave their room looking like a pigsty, to make you feel that your home has been unpleasantly invaded.   One of our best experiences was two years ago, in Wiltshire. Our room had a balcony overlooking the owners' great pride: a lovely flower and herb garden, with a lawn stretching down to a stream and a mill race. It was early summer, and we spent the day stretched out on the lawn, wrapped in the warm scent from the vegetation, listening to the water trickle by. Friends came to join us later and we sipped gin-and-tonics on the balcony while   watching the sun go down. Dinner was at a perfectly decent pub a half mile walk away and, no, I won't tell you where this Elysium is because they don't do B&amp;B any more. Luckily there are plenty of other, similarly nice, places which do.   This summer, I went to Adlestrop in Oxfordshire to write about the 85th anniversary of Edward Thomas's famous poem. (Incidentally, Anne Harvey's gorgeous book, Adlestrop Revisited, packed with essays, pictures,   research about the poem - and poems that pay tribute to the poem - is just published by Sutton Publishing at £12.99.) We had arranged to stay with John and Camilla Playfair at their Sawday-listed house in Aston Magna, just north of Morton-in-Marsh. John welcomed us as if we were his oldest friends down for the weekend.   We were shown to our suite, overlooking the swimming pool and the tennis courts, and my son and I settled down to watch the Cup Final. Meanwhile my wife and daughter took tea in the lounge and were given the guided tour, including the Japanese water garden the Playfairs made themselves.   Again friends joined us, and large gins were pressed on everyone. The Playfairs' daughter, an ex-student of Pru Leith, had cooked supper: a mountain of local asparagus, bought that morning and topped with balsamic vinegar and parmesan; chicken in honey with more local vegetables, then homemade praline and hazelnut icecream with a vast   bowl of strawberries. And a superb cheese board. We had brought our own wine, but the Playfairs, who'd spent the evening at a charity ball, returned in time to press port, brandy and stickies on us.   Next day, we couldn't face a full cooked breakfast, though it was willingly offered, and somehow made do with cereal, breads, toast, fresh fruit, and yoghurt. Before we left another cafetiere of coffee arrived and we were sent on our way to an excellent lunch at the Fox in Lower Oddington, a famous local pub where you need to arrive early, even on weekdays, because they don't take bookings.   The Playfairs charge £35 for a double room, which is slightly more than most B&amp;B's, but around half what you'd pay for a hotel room less than half as pleasant. For dinner they charged £48 for the six of us, but asked us to make the cheque out to the charity. It was quite the nicest, as well as the grandest B&amp;B we've ever stayed in.

6,"The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation by Philip Shenon Little, Brown £12.99, pp457  Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, this rich slice of investigative journalism turns into something still more substantial. We've got the headline points easily enough. We know that the Kean/Hamilton Commission, examining America's response to 9/11, was supposedly nobbled by an executive director in league with the White House. We know that Professor Philip Zelikow, the nobbler in question, had actually been part of the Republican transition team and a close collaborator of Condoleezza Rice. Worse, we know he's risen to bureaucratic glory since as State Department counsellor at Ms Rice's right hand. 'Independent' congressional inquiries don't come any dodgier than this. But that, as Shenon's account of the committee's turbulent history races along, also comes to seem a pretty constrained sensation. What's much more fascinating is his dissection of the politicking that dogged this commission and which will surely dog any heirs and successors when they try to take on associated debacles like Iraq. Indeed, from the Warren Commission (which investigated the killing of President Kennedy) to pallid British parallels, the lessons are eerily similar. First, in Capitol Hill terms, choose your chairman. Dr Kissinger, we presume? But he ducks out because his company has too many Saudi clients, and in comes Tom Kean, a courtly Republican former New Jersey governor turned university vice-chancellor. And a balancing Democratic deputy chairman? George Mitchell, of Belfast fame? But he's too busy. Enter ex-congressman Lee Hamilton from Indiana, a mild, consensual chap. Already the shape of things to come is predestined. If the big names won't play, the lesser names had best stick together as co-chairmen and make as few waves as possible. They pick Zelikow as staff supremo because, though choleric, he seems strong and persuasive. They are warned of their mistake. They press on. The Democrats on the commission reckon that the administration will be unhelpful going on hostile and want to subpoena their evidence from day one. The co-chairs don't agree. Delays and frustration ensue. Neither the funding nor the time is sufficient. Even getting security clearance for commission staff takes months. Writing any sort of report, let alone a wise one, becomes a formidable challenge. At which point, frankly, the alleged importance of Philip Zelikow begins to recede a little. He clearly doesn't want Rice involved. He clearly thinks that the CIA, led by a charming director with a shocking memory, should take most stick. Others, Shenon included, are inclined to dump more opprobrium on the FBI's doorstep. They knew about some of the skyjackers. They had them on a plate. But they were too lumpenly bureaucratic, too administratively arthritic, to get such news from bottom to top. Their old director didn't even have a computer in his office. But at least his replacement, as acting chief, co-operates fully and effusively, unlike George Tenet at the CIA. And thus the sheer pressure of a publication deadline turns the commission's fire away from the bureau. It's the agency that loses autonomy in the final report (as Messrs Bush, Rove and Rice duck for cover). Did Kean/Hamilton do a decent job? Not too bad, in the circumstances, but the huge virtue of Philip Shenon's study is to lay out those circumstances in full. Discover a problem, call for a commission - and this is probably what you get. This, also, may be as good as it gets. We're invited to side with Richard Clarke, the director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council, who Zelikow in transitional mode tried to demote. We're supposed to fit that into a pattern of Bush culpability and (proven) Cheney lies. And it's absolutely true that the Bush team, full of evasions and blanknesses, let 9/11 happen on their watch and could conceivably have prevented it. The difficulty (for us, as for Shenon, a fine, fair-minded New York Times reporter) is being quite certain how to find your own way through this Parkinsonian maze in which everybody, Clarke included, plays an expected role. His job is combating terrorism. He warns his masters about terrorist threats day after day. But he would, wouldn't he? Without such warnings, he wouldn't exist. And somewhere in the melee of messages from every delegated side, you glimpse the essential failure of 9/11. Not that nobody told Bush and Rice what might happen, but that everyone set them different priorities, some muttered, some shouted, and that they chose the wrong basket. Osama bin Laden is the greatest creator of jobs worldwide in the 21st century - wander into any airport and see - but the jobsworths couldn't catch him and haven't caught him yet. The might of the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency equalled incompetence. So, on this evidence, did al-Qaeda's blunderings. Human and organisational weakness ties hunters and hunted together. It's Shenon's great virtue that The Commission is a masters' thesis in human frailty, an open door to deeper understanding of threats so complex that one man and one answer can never be enough."
6,"The Bush Tragedy: The Unmaking of a President  by Jacob Weisberg  Bloomsbury £16.99, pp271 It is irresistible to think of Hollywood turning this scintillating thesis of book into a big-screen epic a few years down the road and watching the notional credits roll. Screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, Eugene O'Neill and Edna Ferber. Additional dialogue by Churchill and Arthur Miller, based on an unoriginal idea by Sophocles and Shakespeare. Starring Sean Penn as George W Bush, Clint Eastwood as Poppy Bush, Meryl Streep as Barbara and Russell Crowe as Karl Rove. Running time: roughly 57 years, from the day Prescott Bush became a US senator to the day next February when grandson George leaves the White House for ever. And there is an almost cinematic plot here, one that seeks to bathe modern politics in history and psychology. Here's Prescott, an uptight bear of an East Coast merchant banker, married to Dorothy from the Midwest Walker family. Her dad is a banker, too, but a reckless, carousing adventurer from the other end of the Bush moon. Prescott and Dorothy have five kids and a rigid family philosophy. Boys don't get spoonfed riches or favours. They go far away and try to make their own fortunes. Second son George Herbert Walker Bush does precisely that. He goes to war and becomes a real hero; then he goes to Texas and finds oil. But this temporarily exiled Kennebunkport Yankee wants to turn politician, just like dad. The family Bush has loads of clout. Poppy Bush becomes director of the CIA, ambassador to China, veep of the USA and then commander-in-chief from the Oval Office, hailing triumph in the Cold War before starting a hot one in Iraq. But Poppy and Barbie's eldest son George has a lot of the Walker in him. Dad and Mum give his boozing and lowbrow high jinks pretty short shrift. They think their second son Jeb, down there in Florida, will be the true standard-bearer of family values. Thus they piss off George W. He stops boozing, finds God and Laura - and also finds Rove, one of Poppy's unregarded backroom boys. Together they win Texas and then the White House, whereupon young George embarks on a determined programme of self-destruction - not seeking, as previously supposed, to honour his father and mother, completing their work, confirming their legacy. No way. Young George is going to stick it to old, quavering, thoughtful George. He's going to have clear, triumphal policies. He's going to blast that bastard Saddam, who once tried to blow up the Bushes, right off the face of the earth. Which is where tragedy enfolds Texas and the world. Books about George W have moved over the years from hagiography to mere slaghimoffgraphy, chronicling the supposed transition from titan to figure of fun. Weisberg, the editor of Slate magazine online, is a scholar, wit and acute observer. He's made a living out of several collections of Bushisms, volumes of dunderheaded verbal bloopers. Now he tries serious and is seriously brilliant. This portrait of a senior son scorned and utterly pig-headed arrives supported by many telling quotations from inside the family and solves otherwise baffling mysteries. Why invite Baker-Hamilton, that committee of wise, grey men, to tell you how to get out of Iraq, then tell them to take a running jump? Because Jim Baker was Poppy's fixer, doing Poppy's business. Because any surge is better than dripping around like Dad. You can explain a great deal in this fashion, via the passion of hearth and home. Add disaffected or disgruntled courtiers - Rove, with his master strategy for picking the Democratic party apart like a butterfly, wing from wing; Dick Cheney, with his growing obsession that executive action trumps constitutional balances every time - and there's a rational, truly tragic explanation of why the 43rd President has been such a bust, why Rove and George W leave nothing behind them but an electoral stink and snarl. Too easy, too pat? Sometimes. The Poppy Bush I once traipsed round Alabama with on the campaign trail is wry and surprisingly witty, but also unimposing: he waves limp hands and fluffs his perorations; audiences chatter and shuffle when he speaks. Can this flappy chappy really have ruled with a rod of (at least psychological) iron? He's an amiable cypher, the creation of others, not some dominant dynast. And once you loosen the ties that bind his sons to him, even by a half-turn, the plot itself comes to seem a trifle mechanistic. Was it, as Weisberg claims, a huge snub to Poppy when he wasn't invited on stage at the Philadelphia convention which anointed young George? Not at all, if you sat in the hall and watched: Dad and Mum and their two granddaughters had seats in the gallery everyone could see. They were a constant, proud reference point for the cameras. But, observed from a distance, they also set George W free. There is a feeling, from time to time, that Weisberg is whittling his theory down to too honed and simple a size. (It's strange for instance, how neither the weight of Saudi advice nor the depth of duff Mossad intelligence that preceded Iraqi invasion rates a mention). There are also a few literary bridges to Henry V (and Randolph and Winston Churchill ) too far. But none of that drains the fizz from a truly fizzy, original work of exploration. Weisberg can be cruel, giving young George too little credit for conviction under fire. (Choosing the surge doesn't look quite so idiotic now, as McCain surges in behind). Weisberg doesn't make much sense, too, quoting policy options and dense political texts you can't believe that the fount of all Bushisms could possibly read or register. But, overall, this tale of filial pain and revenge offers wince-making insights from page to page - plus the great boon of common sense. Bush's mob - Cheney, Rumsfeld et al - didn't lie about WMD, Weisberg concludes. They did think Saddam could destroy them. 'They tried to frame a man they thought was guilty - which is not quite the same thing as framing someone you know to be innocent.' So is George W guilty as charged? No: read this amateur psychiatrist's report. But don't pronounce him quite innocent, either."
6,"Cecil B DeMille and the Golden Calf<br />by Simon Louvish<br />(Faber) £25, pp400 It is November 1954 and Colonel Nasser has just seized power. So what, pray, are substantial sections of the Egyptian army doing now? Limbering up for Suez defensive duty? No, they're out in the Sinai desert driving chariots, the Pharaoh's faithful minions waiting for the Red Sea to part. Cecil B DeMille is here filming The Ten Commandments. Torrents of dollars flow into the colonel's new socialist coffers (though special marine effects are reserved for a Paramount studio tank back in LA). Maybe 30,000 extras fill the screen as Moses Heston, all jutting jaw and rippling pecs, leads the Exodus. If this is the great Cecil's last movie, then it's a masterpiece of hokum. And the master himself is out and about preaching most of those commandments from the heart (except the one about not committing adultery). You couldn't make it up. Indeed, only DeMille and assorted scriptwriters, some of them part of his honorary harem, would think of making it up. We do not, perhaps, manufacture moguls such as Cecil Blount DeMille any more. Only Spielberg, directing, producing, running his own little empire, comes close. Almost half a century after his death, DeMille's name is shorthand for spectacle, heaving bosoms and epic excess. He made more than 80 movies, start to finish, and almost all of them coined a profit. What more could anyone ask? Surely, a little shrewd critical assessment to mix with the hype, and Simon Louvish supplies exactly that, playing scholar as diligently as he tours the gossip circuit. He hasn't seen everything DeMille churned out after The Squaw Man in 1914, because too much of that is lost and probably gone forever, but he's seen everything there is left to see, especially from the early days when he directed 11 pictures in 1914 plus 14 in 1915, and he knows the artistry as well as the effort involved. There were only three directors who mattered in those early, tumultuous days - DW Griffith, Erich von Stroheim and DeMille - and DeMille wholly earned his place up there with the other legends. He might have come from a family of playwrights - dad, mum, brother William - but he didn't have their talent for the theatre. What he did have was a sense of adventure and inexhaustible energy. He went west to Hollywood almost by accident with his friend, Jesse Lasky. He stayed to dominate it with cowboys and Indians, worlds at war, biblical excursions, even social comedy. He might have helped shape the stereotype of a movie tycoon, but he was not stereotypical. He was a snarler, a driver, a monstrous ego, but he looked after a devoted repertory company of collaborators and mistresses until the day he died. He was a family man in thrall to his wife Constance and children both conceived and adopted, but he might have invented Californication inside his Culver City redoubt. He certainly invented celebrity chat shows (on radio). There's a lot to dislike about DeMille. His rages could part the Red Sea. As he aged, he drifted further and further right, laying out the red carpet for Joe McCarthy. He made film after film about early Judaism, but never seemed to cast an actual Jew in any of them. Sometimes, the sanctimony of his sub-biblical neoconservatism is choking. But he is also the embodiment of early Hollywood: daring, ambitious, crude and cultured, part monster, part commercial genius. Louvish does him proud and, in particular, rediscovers him as a giant of the silent era. Adding words couldn't kill his talent while he remembered how to fill a screen. How would he fare today as epic supplants epic? Probably not as well as he fared in the years before computers took over the action. DeMille didn't like fakery. His kitchen sinks were real. He believed in delivering the ultimate goods. But his stunning spectacles are still the ones we remember. Perhaps we should have let him invade Suez for us."
6,"Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W Bush by Robert Draper. Simon &amp; Schuster £18.99, pp480  Giving by Bill Clinton. Hutchinson £20, pp256 There are four standard phases to the chronicling of an American presidency. One, the glad-confident-morning phase perfected by Theodore H White, dishes up hope and expectation, dew-fresh. The second, around four years later, habitually trades in polemic, defensive or disillusioned. (Robert Draper counted at least 100 books in that category when he sat down to write.) Then, at the close, there's the final verdict, the valedictory, the stab at instant history (Draper's stock in trade), plus a postscript phase that might be called 'What Bill and George did next'. Dead Certain, Washington's hottest dinner-party book this autumn, is a turbocharged phase-three project. How do you sum up a President who'll sit in the Oval Office for 16 more months? Get him to do it for himself. Leaven your judgment through six hours of face-to-face interviews, then top them off with a couple of hundred of chats with his political nearest and dearest. In particular, get him to speculate what he'll do when nobody hails this particular chief any longer. 'I'm gonna build a fantastic Freedom Institute ... I want a place where young leaders: you know, the former Prime Minister of Mongolia, it'd be cool to pay him a stipend, have him come to live in Dallas and write and lecture.' Anything else, sir? 'Well, replenish the ol' coffers ... Clinton's making a lot of money'. (He is indeed, but that's a different story.) Robert Draper is the Washington correspondent of GQ magazine and might thus have been more naturally employed covering the last Clinton years. But he worked in Texas a decade ago, made friends with George W and Karl Rove and was obviously seen as a suitable scribe around court. And he got enough chat room with the men at the top to turn Bob Woodward green with envy. This isn't a particularly well-written account. ('His unmade bed of a life was starting to achieve coherence, thanks to a brunette librarian with catlike eyes named Laura Welch'). Nor is it well-constructed: one thing tends to plonk along after another, already made stale by repetition. But there are fresh facts and insights here and they do carry a punch. The Bush we meet in these pages is not the George W of parody. We see him make his own way, and fortune, in Texas oils, scant thanks to Poppy (Dad's more of rival than a spur). We see him fight hard for the nomination, win by a dubious whisker and become his own man, choosing Dick Cheney for Vice-President, not having him chosen for him. We watch him get into the office by 7.30am sharp and work like a beaver (with two hours' mandatory running or cycling factored in). We hear him take charge of meetings starting smack on time, dressing down a late Colin Powell, chewing off his Iraq lieutenants when they can't get the electricity back on, delivering erudite little lectures on Muslim extremism. He makes decent jokes, plenty of them, but this alternative Bush is no joke himself. He can even seem formidable. But his progress, like his tragedy, comes back to front. The first years in Washington are the good years, listening, careful years (with his vital aide Karen Hughes close by). He's personally staunch after 9/11. He's decisive and passably eloquent. And then it all goes wrong (after Ms Hughes goes back to Texas). There's his father's unfinished business with Saddam Hussein. There's also an increasing refusal to pause, ponder and adjust. This later Bush is a conviction politician who lacks real convictions, a cock-eyed, stubborn optimist. 'Are you an eight-year man?' he asked his staff after four years were gone, but his own sixth and seventh years have been cruelly revealing. Draper can't hide the mistakes of a rigid mindset, but at least he sets this President in a different context: as a substantial politician and operator and nobody's pawn. Don't blame somebody else for the blunders. Bush doesn't. He was responsible, he ruled this roost. But, equally, don't write him off too glibly as a bit of clown. There's nothing buffoonish about the way he shuffles his administration pack (goodbye Andy Card, with a successor already in waiting). And he doesn't blink easily. 'Mr President,' says his National Security Adviser, Steve Hadley, despondent over the latest Iraq policy review, 'you've got to run it.' To which Bush snaps back: 'I am running it.' Whatever the legacy 16 months hence, it will be his legacy. So to phase four and that 'Freedom Institute'. Old Presidents don't fade away. Jimmy Carter still stirs the Jewish lobby with a will. Poppy Bush was there at Bill Clinton's side in New Orleans. And Clinton himself toils in the gardens of redemption and calculation. Giving is a buy-one-thick-autobiography-and-get-a-slim-one-free sort of non-book, a series of homilies on charity and service (often by the Clinton Foundation, battling Aids and African ills) that often seems little more than a list of worthy causes. If you can't give money, give time. If you can't give a lot, like Bill Gates, give a little. This is 'how each of us can change the world' and scepticism inevitably arrives as part of the package. How long before the next election? Count the glowing tributes to Hillary and look for the games hubby's playing now. But don't let the cynicism grow too corrosive, either. Bill Clinton's call to linked arms silences most doubters with its weight of detail, especially when he talks about the 10.2 million Americans now working for a million charitable organisations in the United States. He is putting in the time and effort. He is replenishing the 'ol' coffers' and giving something back, too. Last year, Bush and Clinton bumped into each other by accident at the United Nations. 'Six years from now, you're not gonna see me hanging out in the UN lobby,' George tells Draper, 'with a semi-smirk.' But stranger things have happened. Sometimes - a Jimmy Carter memorial lecture - you can like your Presidents most when they're done and dusted and the best of phase four is still to come."
6,"Borrowed Time<br/>by Roy Hattersley<br/>Little, Brown £20, pp454 Draw up a list of the best 20th-century Prime Ministers we never had and Roy Hattersley is bound to be somewhere near the top. He was - and remains - a political heavyweight. Three years in some long-ago cabinet looking after prices and consumer protection seems poor reward for such talent. But Hattersley has made a far better rewarded second career for himself as writer. Borrowed Time is his 19th appearance between hard covers. This companion to his earlier book, The Edwardians, is a series of essays on the major events and social changes in Britain between the wars. It begins with the unfair peace of 1918, enforced by squabbling, short-term leaders; it ends with an inevitable lurch back into global conflict 21 years later. We had just two decades without carnage. How did we use them? We founded the BBC, placed the cinema above even football as our favourite entertainment. We watched Beaverbrook and Rothermere compete for power in ways that would leave Rupert Murdoch gasping. We heard a gentleman English cricket captain order his players to bowl high at Aussie bodies. Here are some of the many things that didn't reach a full stop in 1939; trends, innovations and rivalries that touch us still. Hattersley loves all sport and most art just as much as he loves social justice. He writes about them with the bounce of true enthusiasm. Maybe you remember Gordon Richards and Gracie Fields? They're here, along with Amy Johnson and JB Priestley. Their comings and goings are, in a way, the staff and stuff of life. Part-nostalgia, part-primer for new generations, they're the heart of this book. But a politician has to write about politics, too, and here the essay technique is rather less helpful. It worked well enough for The Edwardians because, in a way, nothing much happened through an era when Balfour could take extended Highland holidays away from Number 10 in houses without a phone. But the churn of Lloyd George, Baldwin, Bonar Law and Ramsay MacDonald is too confusing to serve out separately, especially jogging back and forth in time from chapter to chapter. A light reader won't follow the plot, a heavy student will want much more and too few connections are made. Hattersley is wonderfully placed to make those connections. He could, implicitly and explicitly, link the general strike to the miners' strike, set AJ Cook alongside Arthur Scargill. ('Cook was an orator, not a negotiator: nor was he a realist'). He could take the abdication crisis and run it through the wringer of our modern monarchy. (The Prince of Wales thought his father 'stuffy, boring and impossible to please'). He could give us more Attlee plus continuing Labour tradition and rather less of Herbert Morrison's squirmings. He could find a little John Major in Neville Chamberlain and entertain by illumination. But, rather disappointingly, he attempts no such adventures within a formula. Borrowed Time is also frozen in time so far as political resonances go. Perhaps Hattersley feels that compare and contrast isn't quite proper history; perhaps he would need a theme too broad for essay bites. Or perhaps his politics, like our politics, exists in a different time capsule of experiences. The names of many of the more minor ministers who pass through these pages seem deeply lost in irrelevance now. Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection? Roy Sydney George Hattersley. You mean that compulsive, prolific, exceptional chronicler of time when the Westminster music stopped? You mean you remember what he did next?"
5,"Never Had It So Good: A History of Britain from Suez to the Beatles<br />by Dominic Sandbrook<br />Little, Brown £20, pp823 At the Queen's coronation in June 1953, Dutch historian JH Huizinga looked at the happy crowds greeting the new monarch and 'grieved' for the British. They thought that 'history would not deal with them as it had dealt with other nations which had strutted their brief moment of power on the world stage ... the more sympathetic comprehension one had for the high hopes with which they embarked on the second Elizabethan era, the more acutely one realised what a painful era it would be, how rich in disillusionment, frustration and humiliation'. The first volume of Dominic Sandbrook's spectacular history of the Sixties is a chronicle of how the realisation of irreversible national decline hit the British after the Suez crisis. Alert readers will have noticed that Suez was in 1956, but Sandbrook breaks with precedent and yanks the Sixties out of the culture wars in which, according to taste, it was either the devil's decade or a time of liberation for the oppressed, and seeing it as a part of long, slow changes in British society. A second novelty, and for baby boomers an ominous one, is that he can't remember the Sixties. He wasn't born until 1974. Never Had It So Good is a sign that the period is slipping from memory into history, and young Sandbrook's great advantage is that he can see how the similarities between people who then saw each other as enemies were as striking as the differences. The supposedly socialist film director Lindsay Anderson sounded like Colonel Blimp reviewing a shabby working-class regiment when he lamented the backwardness of British proletarian life. Every return from sophisticated Europe was 'an ordeal. It isn't just the food, the sauce bottle on the cafe tables, and the chips with everything. It isn't even saying goodbye to wine, goodbye to restaurants. For coming back to Britain is like coming back to the nursery'. The middle-class leaders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament were as convinced that the British could continue to lead the lesser breeds as the most diehard empire loyalists. 'We thought that Great Britain was still a great power whose example [of unilaterally renouncing nuclear weapons] would affect the rest of the world,' wrote AJP Taylor when he looked back. 'Ironically, we were the last imperialists.' Sandbrook is as at ease discussing the treacherous way Harold Macmillan dealt with his colleagues as the passion for apocalyptic science fiction when the Cold War threatened to turn hot. He explains the vicious misogyny of the 'new wave' working-class films by pointing to how the consumer boom encouraged domesticity and the power of women, and shows how that consumerism meant most people didn't give a damn about the loss of empire. There are hundreds of killer quotes and anecdotes. Colin Wilson whose demented claims to be the 'major literary genius of our century' were taken seriously by literary London for a year or so, fell from grace when the father of his girlfriend burst into his flat with a horsewhip crying: 'Aha, Wilson, the game is up! We know what's in your filthy diary!' and forced Wilson to hand his mucky and grandiose ramblings to the Daily Mail. When Selwyn Lloyd was offered a post at the Foreign Office by Churchill, he replied: 'But, sir, there must be some mistake. Except in war, I have never visited any foreign country. I do not like foreigners. I have never spoken in any foreign-affairs debate in the House. I have never listened to one.' 'Young man, these all seem to me to be positive advantages,' growled Churchill in return. Sandbrook covers a vast amount of ground. But he does have a theme: 'The yearning for an alternative to the old-fashioned, complacent Conservatives who were thought to be running the country into the ground.' The revolt of the early Sixties against the old Tory order was social rather than political. The mood articulated by the casts of Beyond the Fringe and That Was the Week That Was or the staff of Private Eye wasn't a desire to change the system but to open it up. It takes a very closed ruling class to turn such natural Conservatives as Richard Ingrams into rebels. So tight and secretive was it that a journalist didn't realise that Sir William Haley was the editor of the Times and a former BBC director general, and went through a whole interview thinking he was Bill Haley, the rock'n'roll pioneer. As a scrupulous historian, Sandbrook avoids drawing modern parallels, but the reader can't avoid being struck by the cunning of history. With the old Tories gone, the Sixties were meant to end elitism and bring a meritocracy. Instead they cleared the road for a new elite which sustains itself in power by insisting it is against the establishment and an education system which makes it all but impossible for bright working-class children to get on. The book begins with the failure of Sir Anthony Eden's Suez adventure, which allowed all the tyrants in the Middle East to buttress their power by posing as anti-imperialists. Today, Tony Blair is accused of being the new Eden, although his Iraq adventure has shaken the foundations of Middle Eastern tyranny. It is a tribute to Sandbrook's literary skill that his scholarship is never oppressive. Alternately delightful and enlightening, he has produced a book which must have been an enormous labour to write but is a treat to read."
5,"The Triumph of the Political Class by Peter Oborne  Simon &amp; Schuster £18.99, pp390 During an interview in 2003, Gordon Brown took the trouble to argue with a long-dead academic, all but unknown outside conservative intellectual circles. 'There is a Namier school of history, which suggests that everything is less to do with ideas and popular concerns than with the manoeuvrings of elites,' he told the Times. 'I do not accept that ... politics is about ideas and ideals and is about the policies that reflect the concerns of people.' Lewis Namier (1888-1960) argued in his masterwork The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III that talk of great battles of principle between the Whigs and Tories of Hanoverian England was nonsense. Ministers were in politics for the money and to advance the interests of their cliques. MPs who boasted of their independence were forever seeking favours from the public purse. Ideology mattered so little that 'the political life of the period could be fully described without ever using a party denomination'. You can do the same today, argues Peter Oborne in this thought-provoking polemic. Members of the 21st-century 'political class' are as isolated and self-interested as their Georgian predecessors and Brown's outburst against the realism of Namier was nothing more than the rage of Caliban at seeing his face in the glass. Oborne is a muscular writer who values intellectual clarity and he works hard to explain that he does not regard the political class as a continuation of the old establishment. On the contrary, it despises the values of traditional institutions that once acted as restraints on the power of the state - the independence of the judiciary, the neutrality of the Civil Service and the accountability of ministers to the Commons. It takes a while to be convinced because, like the Prime Minister, the British tend to think of political parties, in a watered-down Marxist way, as manifestations of class interests fighting for different visions of how society should be run. Oborne neatly turns conventional wisdom on its head and argues that the modern elite is contemptuous of traditional constraints precisely because it has been taught by Marxist academics that the rule of law or the personal responsibility of politicians are just fictions that hide the power of the privileged. The modern political class thinks it can override these discreditable constitutional conventions because it has been elected, albeit by an ever-diminishing proportion of eligible voters. If you are young and ambitious and want to join, Oborne sketches out a career path. First, you must set yourself apart from your contemporaries at university by taking an interest in politics. You must join a think-tank or become researcher to an upwardly mobile MP on graduation. Before getting to the top, you will have eaten with, drunk with and slept with people exactly like you, not only in politics but in the media, PR and advertising, trades the old establishment despised, but you admire for their ability to manipulate the masses. You will talk a language the vast majority of your fellow citizens can't understand and be obsessed with the marketing of politics rather than its content. You will notice that once in power, you can get away with behaviour that would have stunned your predecessors. You can use your position to profit from lecture tours and negotiate discounts, as Cherie Blair did. You can try to find your mistress a job in the Civil Service, as Robin Cook did, or make love to your mistress in government offices on government time, as John Prescott did. When challenged, you will say that 'everyone in business behaves like this' when, in fact, they don't. Politics will be your career. You will have no experience of other trades and, paradoxically, be a worse politician for it. Because you've never managed a budget or a large institution or served in the armed forces, the likelihood is that you will waste vast amounts of public money and send British troops into battle unprepared. Oborne marshals his facts impressively. As a political commentator first on the Spectator and then on the Daily Mail, he has seen at first hand the subservience of lobby correspondents to New Labour and presents the reader with gruesome scenes of Alastair Campbell being cheered on by sycophants at lobby briefings. But although Oborne loathes the Westminster beat where he has spent his adult life, he can't escape from the narrow-mindedness of Westminster journalism and see the wider world beyond. He denounces politicians for their soundbites, but fails to mention that television news will broadcast only those politicians who deliver soundbites. He deplores ministers' criticisms of judges, but fails to understand how the Human Rights Act has given judges political power. And having condemned the effects of Marxist teaching on today's politicians, Oborne metamorphoses into a Tory version of Noam Chomsky as he wails that democracy is a facade and media independence a myth. Hysteria inevitably follows such a descent and he concludes by muttering that England is on the edge of fascism. Such blemishes detract from but do not destroy a powerful and troubling study. At his best, Oborne is a patriot who wants to protect the best of his country from smarmy men and women who know everything about power except how to use it wisely."
7,"Global Woman: Nannies, Maids and Sex Workers in the New Economy <br />edited by Barbara Ehrenreich and Arlie Russell Hochschild <br /> 336pp, Granta, £8.99  This is western feminism's dirty little secret. Behind the glorious image of the have-it-all woman in the Armani suit, with a Gucci briefcase on one arm and a baby tucked under the other, too often lies a tale of the oppression of another woman. Domestic servitude has only been escaped by passing it down to another cadre of oppressed women. Battalions of low-paid women - in America most of them foreign - have taken up the domestic duties, along with the dirty washing, discarded by professional women who have fled the home. Liberation for high-fliers breaking through glass ceilings is only possible because of a flotilla of unseen, unheard women who care for their children, clean their homes and cook their meals while they live liberated like men.  This is a book to tear at the heart and wrench with guilt many women who already feel they are juggling their lives on a knife-edge. Their own deep anxieties about their children and their high-pressured lives are all too often passed on to the women who work for them, making them exceptionally bad employers.   In America this is a story of the mass importation of a precious new raw material - care and love - from the third world. Take one typical case: Rowena Bautista left a village in the Philippines to work as a domestic in Washington DC - one of about 800,000 legal household workers (plus armies of illegals). In her basement room she has photos of four children, two of her own whom she has left behind and two of her American charges to whom she has to some extent transferred her love and care.   She left her own children in the care of their grandmother five years ago when the youngest, Clinton, was only three: she could find no work to provide for them. The children's grandmother is herself so hard-pressed that she works as a teacher from 7am to 9pm each day, so Rowena has hired a local woman to cook, clean and care for the family in her long absence. (In her turn, that woman   leaves her own child in the care of a very elderly grandmother.) Rowena hasn't managed to get home to the Philippines for the last two Christmases, but the family relies on the money she sends.   Rowena calls the American child she tends ""my baby"". She says: ""I give Noa what I can't give my own children."" Last time she saw her own son, he turned away from her, asking resentfully: ""Why did you come back?""   The distress and damage done to such abandoned children is well-documented in this collection of research. A series of essays edited by two of the great American writers on work, it exposes a deeply shocking underworld of globally exploited women. This is one of those moments when things that are known but unspoken are dragged out into the light of day. Chapter after chapter reveals how women's traditional roles, rejected by western women, are now being filled by wickedly treated other mothers. Their love is bought, they give everything to their charges and yet they are often sacked on a whim, never to see their child charges again.   Imported cleaners, cooks, old-age carers, nannies and housemaids are joined by mail-order brides for men who like the submissive ""old-fashioned"" values from the east. (That chapter is aptly called ""Highly Educated Overseas Brides and Low-Wage US Husbands"".) And there are the sex-workers and sex-slaves, some who knew what they were in for, others who were tricked or kidnapped. Horror stories abound, including child sex tourism.   Countries such as the Philippines have become economically dependent on the remittances women domestic workers send home. They may leave behind men whose skills are in less demand in the west: demoralised by unemployment, some husbands turn to drink and gambling, wasting all the hard-earned money their wives send, leaving the children worse off than if their mothers had stayed home.   This is a most brutal example of the force of globalisation, draining even love away from poor countries. It is the final depredation, exploiting the last resources the third world has left to sell - motherhood and sex.   Since this is an American book, I checked the official number of domestic workers in Britain: it is 154,000 and not rising, though a great many more certainly work in the black economy. There have been enough cases of diplomats   bringing in visa-slaves as domestics to make it clear that many of the same abuses happen here. In the UK the social injustice is mainly indigenous: professional women pass their un-wanted domestic work on to poorer British women at pitiful rates of pay. Only the richest 20% of working women can afford to buy childcare, paying very low wages to minders or nursery assistants. Well-paid nannies are confined to the topmost echelons.   What is to be done? Barbara Ehrenreich's ground-breaking book  Nickel and Dimed exposed the impossibility of living on the minimum wage in the US: one of her most memorable jobs was working for The Maids, a domestic cleaning service. Here, recalling that starvation drudgery, she offers a ferociously forensic dissection of everything wrong with a corrupted capitalism that has led to this exploitation of third-world women.   Hers is a devastating feminist critique, almost as savage about high-earning women who pass on their domestic duties as she is about the sexist world in which all domestic work is consigned to women in the first place. In the ""chore wars"" of 1970s feminism, she says, men won. They took on    almost no extra housework or childcare. ""Enter then the cleaning lady as  dea ex machina, restoring tranquility as well as order to the home,"" she writes. Marriage-guidance counsellors now recommend them as an alternative to squabbling.   In the US, this is a race as well as a class issue: maids are mainly black, reinforcing rich kids' views that black means servant: a little white girl in a supermarket trolley passing a little black girl exclaims: ""Oh, look Mommy, a baby maid!"" The mistress-maid relationship is fraught, and Ehrenreich describes how an ""overclass"" has become deskilled in any domestic knowledge, unable to cook or clean, with children who would ""suffocate in their own detritus"" without someone to pick up after them. She twists the knife in overprivileged women who have ""something better"" to do with their time in a society where the rich get richer and the poor poorer.   In Britain, this debate revolves around the state's failure to provide universal childcare with well-paid nursery assistants: there's nothing wrong with equal women working for good pay as respected childcare professionals. In the US, state provision is not even worth talking about.   But Ehrenreich's eloquent moral fury is primarily directed at a capitalism that exploits every last drop of blood of the weak, wherever they are in the world, whatever they have to sell, even a mother's love. Unregulated, out-of-control capitalism creates a long-hours culture in which women cannot compete and still be mothers. Above all, the fault is with men who still refuse to take an equal share in everything domestic - thinking, planning and doing. If they did, the nature of work would change.   This deeply disturbing book reaches right to the dark heart of society's worst dysfunctions, with stories to make you weep with outrage. If postfeminism means that it's all right for some other woman to be exploited instead of you, this should fire up some of that good old-time passion. Feminism always was a revolutionary project, and Ehrenreich bemoans a project left uncompleted: ""Sooner or later someone else will have to finish the job."
7,"Climbing the Bookshelves: The Autobiography by Shirley Williams 432pp, Virago, £20 Few politicians are loved or even liked, and even fewer of those are women, who are subjected to quite disproportionate venom. Shirley Williams was and is an exception. The warmth of her mellifluous voice can unfreeze the frostiest public meeting. Rumpled, unbrushed and late, she brings intensity and informality into any room. In TV studios or on conference platforms, she speaks human, which is a surprisingly rare political talent. Ken Clarke has it, Tony Blair and David Cameron have it, Denis Healey has it, but not many others. Likability, affability, apparent normality, sounding as if they mean what they say  this is political gold dust. Politics is littered with might-have-beens, victims of the multiple accidents and upsets that set unlikely winners on the throne and trip up an army of better prospects. In the late 1970s and 80s, Williams was seen as the mirror image of Margaret Thatcher, women being always set against one another. Thatcher once watched Williams as a minister under fire at the dispatch box. Afterwards, in the Lady Members Room, ironing a dress, she (Thatcher of course, Williams never looked ironed) said: ""You did well. After all, we can't let them get the better of us."" Sisterliness was not in Thatcher  but she understood women had to be 10 times better to survive. Comparing the two makes it easy to see why Williams was never quite a contender: she was too nice. Unlike Thatcher, she always backed other women and feminist causes, but as Harriet Harman or Hillary Clinton can attest, it doesn't make you popular. Williams's mother, the writer Vera Brittain, was remote and busy, so encouragement came from her father, the university lecturer and failed Labour candidate George Catlin. Winifred Holtby  beloved Auntie Winifred  great chronicler of Yorkshire municipal life, lived with them during Williams's Chelsea and New Forest childhood. The two Catlin children were shipped away for the war years to Minnesota, a long separation during which she thrived against the odds. Returning in time for the Attlee election, while still at school she plunged into the Labour League of Youth and was sent as a representative to the first postwar conference with German SPD youth. At Oxford she fell in love with Peter Parker (later to run British Rail), playing Cordelia to his Lear on an American tour directed by Tony Richardson. Many thought she might take the theatrical path: she could have been a Judi Dench with that voice. But forced to choose, she stuck with her politics, philosophy and economics open scholarship. Her Oxford Labour life coincided with those of Tony Benn, Tony Crosland and Bill Rodgers, the war having mixed generations. Then came a Fulbright year in America and a brief, disastrous stint at the Daily Mirror. After fighting a no-hope seat in 1954, she married Bernard Williams, the philosopher, whom she describes as ""in perpetual intellectual motion, like a dragonfly hovering above a sea of ideas"". But ""he was not easygoing. Nor was he faithful."" They had a child but divorced in 1970, which meant she lost government and husband in one bad year. ""I took my husband for granted"", she writes, but  recalling how she dashed home for her daughter's supper and bedtime, then back to the Commons for late votes, as one of just 29 women MPs  adds: ""There is no satisfactory solution until men share domestic burdens."" She had won Hitchin with Labour's victory in 1964  and lost her seat at the dismal end of Labour's era in 1979. Worst of her jobs was ""Canute's chair"", as secretary for prices and consumer protection with inflation at over 13%. First as junior to Crosland and later as education secretary, she was in the thick of Labour's rapid comprehensivisation of schools, for which she became notorious. Though she was not the originator of the policy, her passionate opposition to the grammars, which selected fewer than 25% of pupils and rejected the rest, made her an eternal hate figure of the Spectator right. Auberon Waugh was ceaseless in abuse and mockery of her as emblem of the ""nanny state"", which Labour women always are to men who had nannies. In 1981 came the great rift when she, David Owen, Roy Jenkins, Bill Rodgers and others finally broke with a Labour party staggering under Michael Foot's leadership and in thrall to Militant. ""For me leaving the Labour party was like pulling my own teeth one by one."" What if they hadn't left? In Labour circles the old debate still rages. She gives a crisp reminder of the destruction the now cuddly Benn wrought on Labour back then. When she won the Crosby byelection, upsetting a huge Tory majority, the new SDP went over 50% in national polls, but the bubble burst with Thatcher's Falklands recovery. Her descriptions of those tempestuous times are characteristically honest: this is not the usual self-serving, self-justifiying version of events. Don't expect the spicy one-sided malice of a Richard Crossman or an Alan Clark. What you get is what you might expect  a straight narrative, few secrets, no bitching but clear-eyed political analysis. ""Like many women of my generation, I thought of myself as not quite good enough for the very highest positions in politics,"" she writes at the end with some ruefulness. Compared with whom? But she is by nature not much given to self-revelation or introspection: mysteries remain, such as her barely explained Catholicism. You know her not much better, but you like her to the end. Polly Toynbee is co-author of Unjust Rewards: Ending the Greed That is Bankrupting Britain (Granta)."
0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by JK Rowling  608pp, Bloomsbury, &pound;17.99 There are still one or two questions left unanswered at the end of Harry Potter's last adventure. It cannot be giving anything away to reveal that we never discover how Eloise Midgen can be a martyr to acne at Hogwarts, a place where bones can be grown back and complex orthodontics effected with the wave of a wand. With JK Rowling it has generally been niggling little questions of internal logic that give the reader pause, rather than the mysteries of her grander scheme in which that prime specimen of embodied evil, Lord Voldemort, slowly acquires the power he needs to defeat Harry Potter, his only adequately qualified adversary. By book seven, if you are familiar with Rowling's vast, ever-expanding parallel universe, it seems only to be expected that this wizarding terrorist should, by now, be close to completing a fascist-style takeover of the UK (both material and magical sections), in the course of which non-wizards and half-wizards are being rounded up for questioning by ""pure bloods"" and sent off - if they survive their show trials - to a wizard-run concentration camp. Now that the 17-year-old Harry has abandoned school for his dreadful, extramural quest, only he can determine whether the lights will go out all over the democratic wizarding world. To anyone unacquainted with the epic so far, the latest tale will be incomprehensible. In earlier volumes, Rowling made heroic efforts to initiate new readers, but since this process would now require, at a minimum, a glossary, rule book and catalogue of magical objects, she seems to have given up the task as hopeless. But some regular readers may also be disconcerted by a tranche of Hogwarts in which there is neither Quidditch nor lessons. All the familiar Harry scenes have gone missing, from the inaugural, always comforting comedy inside No 4 Privet Drive and the annual bullying bout on the Hogwarts Express, to Mrs Weasley's Christmas jumpers and - more mercifully - Hagrid's inevitable adoption of some tiresome magical creature whose assistance will later prove critical. There was a time when you could set your clock by it. To go into detail about the questing and battles that have replaced the usual timetable would probably be unfair: even a week after publication there may still be one or two children as innocent of Harry's fate as the American crowds who gathered at the New York harbourfront in 1841 to ask disembarking passengers from England, ""Is Little Nell dead?"" But only Quidditch fans could complain about the outcome: Rowling has woven together clues, hints and characters from previous books into a prodigiously rewarding, suspenseful conclusion in which all the important questions, including the true nature of Severus Snape, the fates of Crabbe and Goyle, and the presence of the dark wizard Grindelwald on a Chocolate Frog card in book one, are punctiliously resolved. The author was surely right, on the eve of publication, to implore journalists not to spoil the surprise for a generation who have enjoyed something unique in children's literature (where the characters tend to stay the same age, like William Brown, or, if they do mature, to do so as hobbits, Romans or Aslan worshippers): a chance to grow up, in real time, with their heroes. But Rowling was duly accused of colluding with a ruthless marketing operation, which led to 2m copies of her book being sold within 24 hours of publication. Although her sales techniques do contrast sharply with arrangements in Harry Potter's Nintendo-free world, it is curious that Rowling should be so harshly judged for her engagement with the book trade. Didn't most eminent Victorian novelists fight just as greedily for their profits, become, in several cases, international celebrities, and see their better cliffhangers and denouements stimulate the nation into moments of collective delirium? But as her critics point out, Rowling is no Dickens. That the welfare of Harry Potter should, each year, become a question of national importance has only deepened a suspicion, in some quarters, that Rowling's writing is not merely mediocre but contaminated by her participation in a crass celebrity culture. In 2000, Harold Bloom despaired for her readers. ""In an arbitrarily chosen single page - page 4 - of the first Harry Potter book"", he objected, ""I count seven clich&eacute;s, all of the 'stretch his legs' variety"". If his computations had continued, Professor Bloom's clich&eacute; tally might by now have run into the thousands; the books have got so long and Rowling's style has remained unsophisticated, with an irrepressible tendency to show and tell. You feel that simply by cutting intra-paragraph repetition and the number of times she describes an angry Harry saying something angry angrily, Rowling and her editors might have saved 10,000 trees. But colossal energy and wit have gone into other things: writing at speed, almost before her readers' eyes, Rowling has willed into fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots. This is altogether a towering fictional edifice whose vividness and sheer scale are enough to compensate, for many of us, for any deficiencies in design. Anyone who, as a child, never wanted a favourite book to end, must envy the Potter cohort a magical world that has grown by hundreds of pages a year; a world whose arrangements Rowling has depicted in such sublime, almost manically generous detail, that for 10 years her readers could more or less live inside it. Equally enchanting for younger readers, Rowling appears genuinely to like and respect children, to cherish them, almost, for their moods, faltering courtships, naive political ideas, mistrust of adults and, in the new book, a vocabulary that includes the word ""toerag"". Only her teenagers can save their parents' generation from Voldemart's schemes for a master-race - in itself the consequence of the older wizards' conceit and their cruelty to supposedly inferior beings, the gnomes and house-elves. As well as saving adults, Harry the freedom fighter subjects them to homilies, in which he urges remorse, courage, good parenting: ""Parents"", Harry tells an errant father, ""shouldn't leave their kids unless - unless they've got to."" His, then, is a most instructive mission that might be as nauseating as anything in Heidi, were Rowling not free with deflating asides from various members of the Weasley family. ""Overkill, mate"", remarks Ron, just as Harry's bonding session with a mistreated elf teeters on the brink of mawk. It is a key element in Rowling's own myth that she plotted the entire Potter series before she started, and on its completion, you can see that the protagonists, the principal families and their allegiances, the design of Hogwarts public school, and the grand plan for a final confrontation between goodness and badness were, as alleged, always in place. But since book three there has been more and more evidence of (occasionally helpless) ad hoc-ery. Everything must have changed once it became clear to Rowling and her publishers that her readers - adults as well as children - would gobble up as much Potter as she could bear to produce. Hence such things as the tri-wizard tournament and an excursion to Downing Street to meet a Muggle prime minister whose original has also disappeared without trace. Even the newly arrived Hallows, some nifty plot accessories that allow for all kinds of crises, personal challenges and protracted revelations, point at a desperate struggle, once Rowling had arrived at the middle of the last book, to hold off the final act. By itself, the cheeky Hogwarts motto (Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus) that ornamented the title page of The Philosopher's Stone is enough to suggest that Rowling did not, back in 1997, plan to end her series with a protracted meditation on death, prefaced by a few lines from Aeschylus: ""Oh, the torment bred in the race, the grinding scream of death."" The Potterati, scanning the text for learned allusions (and there are plenty, from Dante and Orwell to Jesus Christ and Tinky Winky), may well see in its genocidal, dystopic shadows the intrusion of a real world that became, not long after Harry Potter arrived in it, a far more frightening place. But the book's resounding melancholy may derive from something simpler. Whatever happens in the last of these brilliant adventures may matter less, for the millions of children who grew up with Harry Potter, than the end of his companionship and with it, the end of their childhood. Which is a much more wholesome story than Peter Pan's, but sad, all the same."
0,"Snobs: A Novel <br />by Julian Fellowes <br />320pp, Weidenfeld, £12.99  Edith Lavery, the heroine of Snobs, has, like Thackeray's Becky Sharp, but one ambition: to find a wealthy husband who will give her a position in society. ""How else was she to enjoy the good things in life if she did not marry them?"" And even though her search for greatness is conducted during the 1990s, as opposed to the Napoleonic wars, in the world according to Julian Fellowes Edith's appraisal of her prospects makes perfect sense. Unearned greatness, to the snobs he fondly describes, is the very nicest kind of greatness, and it belongs exclusively to the aristocracy. Entry to the aristocracy can be achieved only through marriage. So, unlike Becky Sharp, Edith is something of a role model. Fellowes is married to a niece of Earl Kitchener.  After they are introduced by their mutual friend, the actor/ upper-class person who is the narrator of Snobs, Edith - daughter of a Jewish accountant - sets her sights on the heir to Broughton Hall. Lord Charles Broughton is so grand that even his hair is upper class: ""... that fair Rupert Brooke hair, crinkly curls at the nape of his neck, that is so characteristic of the English aristocrat"". To the acute annoyance of Lord Charles's mother, Edith gets her man. ""Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisified?"", writes Thackeray, after Becky Sharp has plummeted to earth. Not the new Lady Broughton. Her husband is afflicted by three disabilities which, no less than his hair, are so characteristic of the English aristocrat. He is dim, dull and comically hopeless at sexual intercourse. ""Charles, like all men of his type, had the greatest possible distaste for any of the mechanics of womanhood.""   Edith is bored. Not even the prospect of rewriting the guidebook can cheer her up. Before you can say serviette she has fallen for an actor in a costume drama and started out on her return journey to social oblivion. The exalted group that Fellowes likes to capitalise as the Gang, the Inner Circle or Society instantly cuts her dead. Edith discovers the agony of being denied entry to Annabel's. She is obliged to buy chain-store clothes, which cruelly expose the housemaid genes that made her marriage an unfortunate experiment in what the narrator terms ""miscegenation"". If there are few surprises among the humiliations subsequently meted out to this ""child of an arriviste"" - snubbed by those who sometime did suck up to her, stuck in a poky flat, tortured by the longing for the splendour she so lightly discarded - Edith's cautionary tale provides a serviceable pretext for what is really a doting guide to the English aristocracy.   For the novice climber, Fellowes's guide to the basics of social mountaineering should prove a godsend. It is illustrated with some cherishably nasty,  Gosford Park-style scenes of aristocratic point-scoring, and is far more illuminating than a copy of  Correct Form on the customs and affectations designed to ensure that Gang members can always be distinguished from everybody else.  Snobs is not too grand to answer the most basic questions. How should I word it? ""The upper classes only ever address an envelope to the female part of a couple."" How should I arrange a ""really smart"" wedding? ""It is out of the question that the company should do anything as middle class or sensible as sit down to eat."" And a smart case of depression? ""The very word counsellor sends a shudder of disgust down any truly well-bred spine."" There is just one important omission. Nowhere does Fellowes say what these truly well-bred people call the toilet.   Maybe because he is not just the husband of Lord Kitchener's niece but an actor as well, Fellowes is engagingly acute on ""the aristocracy's consciously created   image"" - ie, its absolute reliance on the correct sets, props, costumes and audience. ""The English upper classes"", he says, ""have a deep, subconscious need to read their difference in the artefacts about them."" Lord Charles, when we first spot him busily owning his estate on a hot summer day, is wearing ""tweeds and corduroys despite the weather and one of those tiresome brown felt derbies that Englishmen in the country imagine to be dashing"". The ""tiresome"" is one of many reminders that, even if the narrator is enough of an outsider to see the absurdities of his friends, posh will always be his first language.   So much so, that if well-bred Fellowes doesn't do something such as invent a plausible sequence of events, it is probably because making things up is common. Smart fiction does not go in for ostentatious plotting: the climactic scene in  Snobs depends on Lord Charles not ever being available on the telephone. Smart fiction has no need for show-offy characterisation: Lord Charles is ""like all his breed"", he has ""one of those English bodies"" and his sister is ""one of those children of the purple"". Similarly for the proles: Edith is ""one of those flawlessly dressed women"", her actor is ""one of those actors"", appearing in ""one of those made-for-television pieces"". Foreigners are simply ""this Levantine"", ""some dusky premier"", ""northerners"". As for Snobs, it is one of those books one imagines being sent up to Balmoral, come September, where it will be proclaimed divinely funny and quite amazingly true to life."
0,"Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour<br />by Kate Fox <br />424pp, Hodder, £20<br />  It was quite a consolation to finish Kate Fox's analysis of Englishness in the departure lounge of Heraklion airport, where, in what resembled some mass audition for Wifeswap, a few hundred English people were unselfconsciously squabbling and cursing and barging into one another. For Fox says we are not like that at all. ""Social dis-ease"", she decides, is the ""central core of Englishness"". She holds this congenital awkwardness responsible for everything from our ""obsession with privacy"" to our celebrated courtesy, famous reserve and infinite capacity for embarrassment. ""We do everything in moderation,"" she believes.  Fox's curiosity about English behaviour, which she attempts to reduce, in this prodigously long investigation, into key constituent parts, is matched only by her regret that we are not a more free and easy nationality. You gather that Fox and her fianc Henry (both prominent figures in her research findings) prefer the dashing and riotous to the stilted and cautious behaviour which, her report claims, continues to dominate English social proceedings. For instance, we say ""sorry"" when someone else bumps into us, and take too much notice of queueing while pretending not to. But then, as well as being almost deranged with embarrassment, we are also ""hypocrites"". We are, in fact, ""the most repressed and inhibited people on earth"". Which must make us even more repressed and inhibited than the Japanese royal family and the monks of Mount Athos.   Since Fox is a leading social anthropologist, we must believe her when she tells us that our rites of passage also leave a good deal to be desired. It ""seems a shame"", she says, ""that there is no special ritual to mark the completion of secondary education"". Maybe we're too mean to pay for them. Contemplating the cautious attitudes of young English people towards work and money, Fox professes herself ""disappointed"" to find them planning for the future and ""not much cheered"" to discover an early aversion to being in debt. This is not, you take it, Fox's recommended approach to being young, English and affluent. Where will it end, she frets, this ""worrying trend"" of ""risk aversion and obsession with safety""? I don't know. Hull? Somewhere in the opposite direction from that other English trend of remortgaging and devil-may-care credit-card spending?   If Fox's casual flourishes - ""but, hey ..."", girlish hyperbole, and reliance on the word ""umpteen"" - are unlikely to do much for her academic reputation, the chicklittish attempts to ingratiate suggest that it is not Bronislaw Malinowksi she wants to be, but the next Peter York (who did, at least, introduce us to the Sloane Ranger). Fox, on the other hand, is happy to expose the working-class habit of saying things like ""nuffink"" and ""serviette"" along with other mannerisms more succinctly summarised in Betjeman's ""How to Get on in Society"": ""Phone for the fishknives Norman ... "" Still, one day her exhaustive observations on these ""hidden"" rules may prove invaluable to visitors from another planet. They may not know that ""M&amp;S is a sort of department store"", or realise that ""some working class people ... still believe in starting the day with a 'cooked breakfast' ... this feast may often be eaten in a 'caff' rather than at home ...""   Fox has worked so hard to be charming and fun that she seems to lack the energy, or invention, that would be required to reconcile her theory of an inhibited and ""dis-eased"" nation with the evidence of increasingly unbuttoned, culturally diverse and unpredictable forms of Englishness. Or Europeanness. A good many of Fox's selected ""English"" traits - love of privacy, clubs, DIY and talking about the weather - seem remarkably similar to the French or German love of privacy, clubs, DIY and talking about the weather. But, as the author often reminds us, it's her book, and what interests her are ""the causes of good behaviour"". So what are these causes? ""To be honest, I don't know why the English are the way we are - and nor, if they are being honest, does anyone else."" Fanks for nuffink, as working-class people sometimes say, on finishing a generous but far from nutritious feast of ""social anthropology""."
0,"Snowdon: The Biography by Anne De Courcy 456pp, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, &pound;20 What has worked for Lord Snowdon all his life almost works in this hagiography. In a little world populated by England's most ghastly and dim, he again appears to enormous advantage; abrim with style (of a sort), charm (if you like that kind of thing) and energy (mainly for sex). It is worth remembering, of course, that in this context, the same would apply to the average tomcat. When, to his enormous satisfaction, the priapic photographer (then called Antony Armstrong-Jones) made it into the royal family, it was easy for this spoiled little pixie, with his extra-tight drainpipes and mesmerising bouffant, to be mistaken for a much-needed corrective to the snobbery, stupidity, and stolid sybaritism of the nation's top inbreds. Simply by being a society photographer, as opposed to a titled nothing, Snowdon was able to portray himself as an arty free spirit, almost an intellectual, under whose tonic tutelage, it was imagined, the Windsor troupe might evolve into a more acceptable, near-human subspecies. The success of this experiment can be quickly judged simply by looking at recent pictures of Prince Harry and his girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. One of the most interesting facts in Anne De Courcy's book is that Snowdon never reads. Another is that the most iconoclastic thing he ever did, as a royal, was to wear polo necks instead of ties; a level of democratic endeavour that proved eminently acceptable to his in-laws, who soon discovered that they preferred the dashing, yet reliably subservient, Tony to foul-tempered Princess Margaret. It helped that in all the key matters relating to status, the exploitation of servants, and unembarrassed grovelling, arty Armstrong-Jones was everything they might have hoped from the son of Lady Anne Rosse, or ""Tugboat Annie"" - so called ""because she goes from peer to peer"". Tugboat Jr quite eclipsed her, as he pranced between Queen and Queen Mother, enchanting both ladies to the point that, even after the divorce from Margaret, whom he treated abominably, they pined for his company at Balmoral. But, as De Courcy stresses, the decades of marital feuding and hate notes (""you look like a Jewish manicurist"") had started as a genuine romance. Meaning that Snowdon, who liked to keep several women on the go, may have confined himself to no more than one simultaneous affair, or at most, two, while he was courting the unsuspecting Margaret. Let us hope this provides some consolation to the British servicemen whose pay was docked by sixpence apiece in 1960 in order to provide the pair with a wedding present: ""a small marble-topped commode"", De Courcy reports. The exact nature of the qualities that captivated Princess Margaret, her family, Snowdon's legions of ill-treated lovers and, most recently, the author of this dazzled tribute, remains, even after 400 pages, obscure. Loyal De Courcy passes on reports of an extremely large penis, but that can hardly account for Snowdon's effect on Prince Philip. Or, later, on Christopher Frayling, rector of the Royal College of Art, who said Snowdon was ""the best provost we ever had"". Was it wit? None is recorded here. Young Snowdon's speciality was nasty practical jokes, such as putting dead fish in girls' beds. It was the grown-up Snowdon's, too: ""they would sortie out to the houses of neighbours they knew to be out or away"", De Courcy hilariously reports, of the earl and his chums, ""and rearrange all the furniture"". Looks, then? As irresistible as Snowdon may have been in the 50s and 60s, and even the 70s and 80s, it hardly accounts for the posh old shagger's continuing appeal, not only to the author of this homage, but, incredibly, to an attractive young journalist, Melanie Cable-Alexander (by whom he fathered a child), and, more recently, to Marjorie Wallace, the mental health campaigner who may now be remembered, above all, for her ungovernable passion for a past-it prankster. What do they talk about, over lunch at the Caprice? Much as one would like to imagine the lovebirds exchanging insights on photography, ornithological matters or disabled access, there is little evidence, from the taped conversations that became this book, that the activities which have given substance to his reputation actually interest the earl anything like as much as gossip, sexual intercourse and money. Even quite small amounts of money. There is mention, at one point, of ""postage"". A section about Snowdon's child by Cable-Alexander (one of two children whose paternity he at first questioned) specifies the fearful sums demanded by the little chap's prep school, ""from &pound;2,375 a term"". And that comes on top, Snowdon emphasises, presumably in a bid for sympathy, of ""gas, electricity and telephone services, bills from Berry Bros, council tax of &pound;1,377 ... "" Although De Courcy tries valiantly to generate admiration for various artistic and charitable triumphs, for Snowdon's photographs of ""slum children"", and his campaigns on behalf of disabled people, her efforts are continually nullified; not by her obvious partiality, but by yet more evidence of Snowdon's awfulness, as volunteered to her, exclusively, by himself. There are reasons, De Courcy shows, why Snowdon should have emerged so deceitful, manipulative and cruel; so mean, boastful and silly. His father sounds silly too. His mother, Tugboat, once she'd divorced and remarried, more or less ignored him until he bagged Margaret. He had polio as a child, leaving him with a dodgy leg. Then again, you'd think that half a century of adulation, plus a family, experience and a bit of maturity would eventually even things out. On the contrary. It is only, one suspects, because he is using a wheelchair that Snowdon does not, even now, creep out of a night to plant dead fish or rearrange people's furniture."
0,"Rhythms of Life: The Biological Clocks that Control the Daily Lives of Every Living Thing  <br />by Russell Foster and Leon Kreitzman <br />292pp, Profile, £20  When Margaret Thatcher was in power, her ability to get by on four hours' sleep was widely taken, even by those who didn't much care for her, to be illustrative of the woman's prodigious determination to stay in charge. So much so that there remains the faintest suspicion that any leaders, such as Bush and Blair, who like a good eight hours, are slacking in their duty to stay up, watching over us.  Russell Foster and Leon Kreitzman's illuminating study of biological clocks suggests that in Thatcher's case, we should have been more alarmed than impressed by her working hours, because ""our cognitive abilities change rythmically over a 24-hour period"". Even the intensity of toothache, the probability of an asthma or gout attack, and the strength of a handshake will fluctuate according to the time of day. The variations are not insignificant. Poor visibility is not the only reason why so many catastrophic accidents, including Chernobyl, Bhopal and the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, have occurred at night. For workers on the night   shift, the authors point out, the risk of injury is ""over 20% higher than on the day shift"".   ""Depending on the task,"" they report, ""the performance change between the daily high point can be equivalent to the effect on performance of drinking the legal limit of alcohol. The best time for doing a given task depends on the nature of the task.""   It is not entirely surprising to discover that the best time for complex problem solving and logical reasoning is around noon. On the other hand: ""Tasks that rely more on physical coordination, such as athletic events, are performed best in the early evening."" What is the best time for working out the poll tax? Or deciding whether or not to privatise the railways? Even in the absence of extensive research, one feels fairly confident that the answer to both questions is not two o'clock in the morning.   Such extreme defiance of the night is the more perverse when you consider that most of us already live in a world where, as the authors baldly put it, the imposed 24/7 structure ""is in conflict with our basic biology"". We are ""beset with all manner of artificial timing cues"". Such as alarm clocks. Or, going back a bit, sundials. Until these were invented in brainy Mesopotamia (now Iraq), 5,000 years ago, men and women lived by what the authors call ""natural time"". (Up to a point, surely: didn't cavemen ever stay up late, finishing off their paintings?) The old day/ night routine may have been a bit restrictive, but it was obviously much more relaxed. Half a century after sundials had been introduced in Greece, the Roman playwright Plautus had a character grumbling about the tyranny of time-keeping - ""the town's so full of these confounded dials"".   What annoyed this character, in the second century BC, was having the dial, rather than his own, fluctuating appetite, dictate mealtimes. Today, the tension between internal and external clocks, the consequences of living - in the west, at any rate - in a relentlessly illuminated world in which the body's own circadian rhythms (which still respond to natural changes in day length) conflict with the requirements of an imposed, arbitrarily scheduled working day or night, is yet more pronounced. It is making us ill.   About 3% of people in the UK, for example, are thought to be afflicted by seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a depressive illness brought on by reduced daylight, or by having to keep on going in reduced daylight. But anyone who has suffered from jetlag has experienced the jangling consequences of this conflict between internal and external clocks for themselves. British Airways warns sufferers that their ""decision-making ability"" may be downgraded by as much as 50%, and attention by 75% - which is something to think about the next time Mr Blair flies off on one of his rounds of non-stop international statesmanship.   If the lessons of chronobiology - the study of biological rhythms - are disregarded in the planning of almost all human activities except war and manned space missions, it is possibly because, as the authors relate, rival scientists have been unable to agree whether this subject is a branch of evolutionary biology, or a separate discipline with implications for the study of growth, ageing and medicine. The first group's unworldly preoccupation with the mechanics of the subject has even earned them the disparaging nickname ""clockwatchers"". Although Foster and Kreitzman are thought-provoking and occasionally droll on    the human determination to outwit or ignore the endogenous clock, their anecdotes about jetlag and supersoldiers, owls and larks, are primarily there, you suspect, to sugar the pill for lay readers. The bulk of Rhythms of Life is a serious and at times austere summary of the clockwatchers' research into the origins of rhythmic behaviour, right down to the recent discovery that even bacteria possess their own biological clocks.   It is courtesy of these clockwatchers that we now know the location of a central mammalian clock, which drives an individual creature's daily rhythms. In the middle of the last century, an obsessive physiologist, Curtis Richter, decided it must be in there somewhere, and tracked it down through an awesomely gruesome process of elimination: ""Richter removed adrenals, gonads, pituitary, thyroid, pineal, pancreas. He gave his rats electroshock therapy, induced convulsions and prolonged anaesthesia, and... even got them blind drunk. Still they were rhythmic."" Eventually, he got to the brain, and - eureka! - the rhythms went wonky. The clock was finally located in a cluster of cells towards the front of the brain. The interaction of day length and this internal biological clock tells creatures when to migrate, spawn, mate and hiber nate. And the evolutionary selection pressure to get this timing right - if, for example, deer are born too early they will die - has resulted in some extraordinarily precise responses. ""At higher latitudes, a difference in day length of only eight to 10 minutes will trigger in many species the reproductive, migratory and hibernatory processes.""   The authors anticipate that parts of their summary will delight only those to whom phrases such as ""dPER in its free form is phosphorylated by DBT but not when it is bound to dTIM"" are as clear as day (they recommend skipping rather than giving up when the going gets really tough). But much of their book is lucid enough to leave one in no doubt that the advance of the 24/7 society is something to be resisted very vigorously. Rather oddly, after all their tales of disaster and depression, Foster and Kreitzman seem more inclined to capitulate, suggesting that a handy pill might help us, in the manner of Mrs Thatcher, to ""gain time by reducing the amount we sleep"". And maybe they're right: there will be plenty of time for sleeping later. The Grim Reaper, incidentally, turns out to be a lark: you are most likely to die in the early morning."
2,"ï»¿Bill Clinton had barely been unleashed upon America, when the mythology started to grow. In 1992 the Republicans insisted he was nothing more than the ""failed governor of a small southern state"", but Americans had a feeling he would soon be running their country so they wanted to know more. They gobbled up every morsel, from the story of Gennifer with a G to the legend that the young governor could eat an apple in a single bite. On the press bus we were no different. We heard that the candidate didn't snooze during the long-haul flights or late-night drives through the rural heartland. We heard he stayed awake, gulping coffee or Diet Coke, playing cards - or simply talking. Talking, talking, talking. We heard that one journalist, a young reporter from Newsweek who had been with the campaign since the very start in Little Rock in 1991, had become part of the family: he would sit up at the front of the lead bus, playing hearts with the man who would be president. They may not have admitted it, but every journalist who heard that felt a stab of envy. Everyone wanted to sit, hang out and shoot the breeze with Bill Clinton. Now comes a surrogate for that experience. My Life is not a great book, in places it's not even that good - but when you read it, you can't help but feel you're in the company, one on one, of the man himself. It's his voice you hear on the page, for good and sometimes ill. The fact that it's 957 pages long only adds to the effect: it's as if you've been caught on a train from Boston to San Francisco and ended up sitting opposite the last president of the United States. He's got all the time in the world and he's in the mood to talk. It helps that the style is folksy and conversational. The prologue sets the tone when Clinton reveals that, fresh out of law school, he bought a self-help book that encouraged the reader to list his chief life goals. ""I wanted to be a good man, have a good marriage and children, have good friends, make a successful political life, and write a great book."" Clinton then ticks off how he did and how he ""kept score"". Finally he writes: ""As for the great book, who knows? It sure is a good story."" That's the style throughout, warm and approachable - just like the Clinton persona itself. And it is quite true that the book resembles both the man and his presidency. There are flashes of brilliance, just as there were some dazzling fireworks in the Clinton years: from the handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn to the beating back and outsmarting of Newt Gingrich's Republican revolution of 1994. Clinton the author shows off his talent best when he summarises the political dilemmas of rivals, foreign leaders or himself with concise acuity. (This was always a great Clinton skill: low-level congressmen would come away from an encounter with the president impressed and ever so slightly humiliated, as he would rattle off the latest polling data from, or political strife in, their district in distant Indiana or faraway Maine.) The narrative is engaging, too, just as the rollercoaster ride of those eight Clinton years in the White House was compelling. The accounts of high-wire diplomacy in the Middle East or Northern Ireland, the eyeball-to-eyeball brinkmanship against Gingrich, the entire Monica episode - they are all riveting. As long as you train your eye to skim over the paragraphs on the minutiae of US domestic policy, your interest will be held. But there are deep flaws, just as there were in his presidency. The first is common to both: indiscipline. His administration was often faulted for failing to focus on one or two large goals, pursuing them vigorously. Instead, especially after the congressional defeat of his plan for comprehensive healthcare in 1994 and the Republican ascendancy, Clinton chased a host of small-bore issues - what one commentator at the time mocked as ""teeny, tiny politics"". My Life can be like that, too. It does not structure itself around one or two all-encompassing themes. It is instead doggedly chronological. The US critics who have mocked the book as a ""diary dump"" are right: whole sections seem to have been written by a man flicking through past appointment books, jotting down whatever he can remember. The unhappy results are pages consisting of non-sequiturs: I vetoed a bill on seat belts; later I met the prime minister of Latvia; that evening I apologised to Hillary. I parody, but only slightly. The other structural problem also mirrors a Clinton trait. This fat tome could easily have been split into two books. The first is a rather charming recollection of an Arkansas boyhood, filled with choice southern characters such as Vernon the science teacher or Uncle Buddy the storyteller. The quality of the writing is better here - helped, perhaps, by the absence of appointment diaries to dump on the page. The second book within is the presidential memoir. It begins late: Clinton is not even elected until page 444. Yet it's fitting that these two books go together. For one thing, so much of Clinton's later actions is explained by the nature of his upbringing. (The child in an alcoholic household with an abusive stepfather, constantly playing peacemaker, constantly craving affection. It doesn't take Freud ...) But housing two radically different lives between one set of covers makes a deeper sense. For, as Clinton himself writes often, he learned early to lead ""parallel lives"", one tormented by ""demons"" on the inside, the other marked by great success on the outside. That's the nature of the man and it was the nature of his presidency. It's only right that the book should follow the same pattern. Where an editor might have helped is in curbing the habits of the politician. Too much space is wasted in tributes to colleagues or thanks to foreign counterparts; at its worst, My Life can read like the longest Oscar speech in history. It's hardly a surprise: patting backs is a campaigner's reflex. But there is a more interesting explanation. For My Life is not only a bid to restore Clinton's own reputation - chiefly by pointing up his achievement in securing a decade of relative peace and prosperity - but also the second wave of a double literary offensive aimed at propelling Hillary Clinton to the White House. The first wave was Hillary's own memoir, Living History, but this picks up where that left off. The former president exonerates his wife for the healthcare debacle, blaming himself, and never misses an opportunity to praise her skills as an advocate for children, a strategist or judge of character. On these pages, she is not the ""feminazi"" imagined by the US right. She is Saint Hillary. This might be the simple, political calculation that explains why My Life lacks large quantities of the basic staple of most political memoir: revelations of behind-the-scenes powerplays. He tells us that his staff were split on the 1994 granting of a US visa to Gerry Adams, for example, but reveals nothing that we didn't already know - even at the time. He gives little colour, describes no rows. It's as if Clinton, a politician to his marrow, just cannot bear to offend anyone too badly. He needs to stay friendly with folks, just in case. The exception is his excoriation of Kenneth Starr, the witchfinder-general who, Clinton writes, was determined to drive him from office. The case against Starr is powerful - though it may be too complex, too legalistic, to be clear to the non-anorak reader - yet it somehow undermines My Life. The book strives to show how Clinton has battled his demons, learning forgiveness from some of the greatest men in the world (starting with Nelson Mandela). But the Starr passages reveal that Clinton is still angry and determined to get even - via the political career of his wife if necessary. Once the train has pulled into San Francisco, and the 957th page has been read, what do you think of this man? That he was surely the most intellectually well-equipped occupant of the Oval Office since Thomas Jefferson; that he was a master politician, even if he could not be a great president; and that he had an intense lust for life. And you realise, just from hearing about it afterwards, that it must have been a hell of a ride."
4,"God Is Not Great: The Case Against Religion  by Christopher Hitchens  Atlantic Books £17.99, pp320  For such a rabid God-hater, Christopher Hitchens has a very pious background. If not a binge-worshipper, he was a serial congregant, grazing on a buffet of faiths. Hitchens has been 'an Anglican, educated at a Methodist school, converted by marriage to Greek Orthodoxy ... and remarried by a rabbi'. Unlike one of his rationalist heroes, John Stuart Mill, who wrote of his rare status as someone 'who has not thrown off religious belief but never had it', Hitchens has had to jettison a jumble bag of faiths. He does so with relish. Religion, in God Is Not Great, is 'violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism and tribalism and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry'. Guilty of misogyny, child abuse and fraud on a monumental scale, it is 'a plagiarism of a plagiarism, of a hearsay of a hearsay, of an illusion of an illusion'. On this foundation, an anti-God industry has set out its groaning bookstall. After Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris, Hitchens is the latest fire-and-brimstone atheist. Having sharpened his ire on targets such as Mother Teresa, whom he once denounced as a fanatic, he now takes on an opponent he may consider to be more his own size. Even the most diehard non-believer may balk slightly at the notion of Hitchens as an alternative deity. Not that he sets himself up as such. But even his title, the negative of Allahuh Akhbar, the legend Saddam inscribed on the Iraqi flag, implies a certain greatness in the author. This is Hitch versus God, slugged out to the bloody death. Hitchens's opponents have applied to him the blanket criticism levelled at the anti-theist genre: these people are theological ignoramuses who know and understand nothing of the religions they mock and seek to destroy. This seems a lazy criticism of Hitchens. In addition to dabbling in many faiths, he bases his arguments on a sometimes forensic analysis of the Koran, which he dismisses as borrowed from 'both Jewish and Christian myths' and the Old and New Testaments. (The latter, in his irrefutable analysis, is full of contradictions, illiteracies and late addenda which undermine all literal credibility.) On the evidence of this book, Hitchens has spent too much time around religion, not too little. Like an ex-smoker who grows to loathe the habit more than those who have not tasted nicotine, he abominates God with the zealotry implicit in dictatorial faith. Anyone who has grown up in the shadow of hellfire evangelism will recognise some answering echo here. This is a papal bull for the non-believer. How, Hitchens wonders, can people be so solipsistic, so selfish and so credulous? The early fathers of faith were living in a time of 'human pre-history', when no one had any idea of what was going on and God provided as good a backstory as any. Now that Darwin has explained our origins and Einstein has charted the beginnings of the cosmos, the excuses for blind faith have evaporated. Yet the intelligent and thoughtful remain unshaken in their credo and creationism seems a rising influence on both sides of the Atlantic. Why this paradox has arisen remains largely unaddressed. Hitchens is right in much of what he says. Religion is a charter for war and human suffering. It is enmeshed with child abuse and massacre. From the abortion-clinic picketer to the suicide bomber, its disciples are the deadly and the deluded. They include the bishops preaching wickedly that the Aids virus can leak through microscopic holes in condoms and the Muslim conservatives who, in Hitchens's reportage of Calcutta, denounced polio droplets as a Western plot to induce impotence and diarrhoea. Why would any wise and rational human build his or her life round such mad cults? This question is never really answered. Hitchens does not get to grips with the power of a blind trust that, far from being snuffed out, seems more unquenchable than ever now that all the lies and deceptions of organised religion have been exposed by science. Nor does he examine what, beyond rank stupidity, drives communities and states back to primitive belief. The enlightenment left many gaps. Church attendance might be dwindling, but its art, music and architecture still make many ungodly Britons cultural Christians. Secular society has still not devised rites of passage to welcome people in to the world and usher them out of it. Like Hitchens, people still get their marriages honoured and their children baptised in the name of a hollow God. Science and reason have all the answers, but the spiritual solace they lack is also missing in an encyclical whose many qualities include no shred of tolerance or doubt. Hitchens's book will be manna to the converted, but his explicit aim is to win believers to his cause. I doubt that he will reclaim a single soul."
4,"In a Paris courtroom, art has gone on trial. Novelist Michel Houellebecq, who stands accused by Muslim groups of inciting racial hatred, is defending his right to call Islam a 'stupid' religion. The rowdy hearing has so far been disrupted by invasions of free-speech protesters and far-Right activists. The intellectual and political classes are divided. It is all very French.  Technically, M. Houellebecq's own work is not in the frame, since the incendiary remarks attributed to him were part of an interview in the literary magazine, Lire. However, contempt for monotheistic religions in general, and Islam in particular, is a spinal theme of his new novel,  Platform, which has just entered the British bestseller lists.   The Paris mosque is arguing that 'freedom of expression stops at the point at which it does damage'. If that view prevails, M. Houellebecq may be looking at a year in jail and his book, which deals with love, sex tourism and terror, could face the shredder. The broader danger is that no fiction, The Famous Five apart, may be safe from the censors' scissors.   Enter the directors of three of France's major publishers, warning of mounting suppression. 'Literature's calling is not to appease but to worry and offend,' they tell  Le Monde. 'Nothing human, or inhuman for that matter, is off limits to literature.'   This view, so robustly challenged by Ayatollah Khomeini in the case of the Salman Rushdie fatwa, is being eroded in France. Earlier this month, the publisher Gallimard bowed to legal threats and decided not to resupply bookshops with Rose Bonbon by Nicolas Jones-Gorlin, the story of a murderous paedophile. A similar novel by Louis Skorecki also faces a mauling from children's rights defenders.   Disgraceful, say the three publishing directors. Nabokov, Genet, Roth and Burroughs would have never made it to the bookstands if the Mary Whitehouse tendency had been allowed to thrive. True, but the directors are also being disingenuous. Censorship sells. Penguin's triumph in the Lady Chatterley prosecution shifted 200,000 copies in a day. Censorship glorifies. No one would otherwise be mentioning M. Jones-Gorlin in the same breath as Dostoevsky.   In English chattering circles, where Michel Houellebecq is already lionised, anyone lacking a copy of  Platform (ideally well-thumbed and in French) will be galloping to Waterstone's. M. Houellebecq, like Piat d'Or wine and golden delicious apples, is an exporter's dream. But is he any more palatable?   Atomised, his last novel, was quoted at a million scrubbed-pine dinner tables as the authority on everything from why we have children to the fragmented society. Unless it was just about sex. Platform, though received less rapturously, is admired for its analysis of globalisation and its prescience in forecasting 11 September. Unless it's just about Islam-bashing. And sex.   The British don't quite get M. Houellebecq. Is he a Camus for our times or the Peter Stringfellow of belles-lettres? There are signs, in publishers' minds, of a preference for the latter. The French paperback of  Atomised has a head-and-shoulders portrait of a greasy haired male smoker, while the British cover shows a woman wearing only knickers. Flammarion's Platform is bound in plain buttermilk card: Heinemann's version, imaginatively, shows a woman wearing only knickers.   Such packaging is a metaphor for vacuity. Britain has not much to add to the French debate on blasphemy and the polemical novel. Our cause clbre, The Satanic Verses, is so elderly that the rancour between Salman Rushdie and his media critics long ago eclipsed a dead ayatollah's wrath. In the realm of fiction and politics, the only story of last week was David Willetts claiming Bridget Jones was a Tory.   The bestseller lists, despite exceptions like Nick Hornby and Zadie Smith, reflect none of the broad overview of society provided, in North America, by DeLillo, Franzen and a swathe of women, including Jane Smiley, Carol Shields, Anne Tyler and Alison Lurie. For textbooks on how we live now, we are stuck with Trollope and Trainspotting, plus chick lit and some edgy crime fiction.   M. Houellebecq is keen to expose the supposed phoniness of the modern novelists, in particular, John Grisham and Frederick Forsyth, both more popular with browsers in French provincial bookshops than the offerings of the great controversialist. Neither M. Houellebecq, in his slating of Islam, nor the authors involved in the paedophile scandal have touched any national pulse.   What they have done, successfully, is to pick at society's scabs. The real scandal is not the offensiveness of modern fiction but its lack of controversy and bite. How weird, for example, that paedophilia, a subject that paralyses and obsesses British society, has received no particular fictional analysis since Lolita.   M. Houellebecq's stance on Islam is different. The repugnant views of a novelist pitched somewhere between a communist past and the politics of Pim Fortuyn may whip up trouble as well as outrage. Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the moderate Muslim Council of Great Britain, has been warning the Government of a rise in irrational hatred and fear. In that climate,  Platform, certain to sell widely here, may be seen by some as offensive, even incendiary.   Others will take the correct view that novelists are always entitled to their views, however shocking, and that suppression is the greater evil. There is a place for regulation in the arts; in TV programmes seen by children, for example. There is, occasionally, an argument for banning books. The withdrawal of Michael Barrymore's biography seemed reasonable, since he would have profited from events he described unsatisfactorily to an inquest. But the point about fiction is that it contains, by definition, no objective reality.   Censorship, insidious and arbitrary, implies that people who read novels are too stupid to make up their own minds. Should Goethe's work have been shredded on the grounds that reading about the travails of the young Werther drove impressionable citizens to suicide? Should Agatha Christie have been pulped lest old ladies slipped cyanide capsules in one another's Harveys Bristol Cream?   To deny the novelist absolute freedom of speech would be mad. Equally, it would be folly to imagine that liberty equals power. The prejudices aired in  Platform may be noisome, but they are unlikely to constitute any threat to public order. The Home Secretary's loose talk of Bradford rioters as 'maniacs' and of communities being 'swamped' by asylum-seekers will do more to offend those of other races and religions than anything produced by M. Houellebecq.   Even in France, the novelist has limited influence. In Britain, politics and fiction have never seemed so disconnected. Society's shifts, for good or bad, are rarely incubated in a Booker short list.   Once novels mapped society. Interpretations of  1984 and Brave New World  remain the Ikea of political thought, quickly assembled to furnish any empty space, from a Francis Fukuyama thesis on genetics to a commentator's anti-Bush tirade. Where are the new gurus? M. Houellebecq's critique of clashing of civilisations, however misguided and banal, is a reminder of how wide the gulf between literature and politics has become. For that, at least, he should be thanked."
3,"ï»¿It would be a dreadful mistake to suppose that George W Bush was the first American president who has failed to capture the hearts and minds of liberal-left British opinion. In fact, over the past half century, such disrespect towards the man in the White House has been far more the norm than the exception. We may think we love Bill Clinton now, and we may yearn for him to be miraculously - and unconstitutionally - restored to the presidency, but my God, we patronised him something rotten when he was actually there. Our appetite for tittle-tattle about Clinton's sex life and speculation about his marriage was endless, but too many of us glazed over when it came to the boring old political strategies and policies that were at the real heart of his heroic - yes, heroic - attempt to pick progressive politics up off the mat in the wake of the new right's transatlantic counter-revolution in the 1980s. This failure to take Clinton seriously was characteristic of too much of the liberal left's trivialised disdain towards real politics. It was not much different from our attitude towards most of his immediate predecessors: we were sniffy towards the elder Bush, we never got it about Reagan, we mocked Carter, laughed at Ford, despised Nixon (sometimes even we get something right) and saw only the bad side of Lyndon Johnson, arguably the greatest American politician of the past half century. We see America as a country inhabited by mad people and ruled by buffoons. Our default position was and is condescension, and it says far more about us than it does about them. John F Kennedy was the last American president who was respected by the British liberal left while he was actually in office. Even as an 11-year-old in 1961, I can still very clearly remember the sheer excitement that swept across the Atlantic as Kennedy took his place in the White House. What a speech he gave at that inaugural back in January 1961! What a model of political oratory it still remains. And it wasn't just impressionable Yorkshire schoolboys who were caught up by the heady sense that Kennedy projected of politics as the noblest of all human callings. In the Kennedy years Washington itself was seized with an enthusiasm for public service of which neither America nor Britain has ever since seen the like, which one still lives in the hope of one day seeing again, and which brought the pudgy 16-year-old William Jefferson Clinton to Washington for a handshake and a justly poignant photograph with Kennedy in the Rose Garden in the president's last summer. All of this stemmed directly from Kennedy himself, and later from his brother Bobby too, and it is this idealism - not the glamour and Camelot and Marilyn Monroe and the rest of it - that remains at the heart of the legend. Yet, 40 years to the day since he was gunned down in Dallas, a date which for some of us can never pass without the tears that well again as I write these words, we have managed to turn even Kennedy into just another celeb with feet of clay. Today it is the philandering, the mafia connections and all the other hypocrisies of what Seymour Hersh called the dark side of Camelot that too many of us think of first. Barely pausing after completing an admirable two-volume biography of LBJ, Robert Dallek has now turned to the man who put Johnson on the Democratic ticket in 1960. There must be more books about the Kennedys than about any other family in American history, and many people will wonder whether there is anything new to say. The good news is that there is, and while nothing will quite supersede the reverential tomes written by people such as Schlesinger and Sorensen who were actually there, Dallek has produced easily the best and most objective modern account of JFK. Dallek's unique selling point is that he has had access to previously unreleased records in the Kennedy Library in Boston which detail the full misery of the president's health problems - as well as the immense efforts to which he went to conceal them. How one responds to the mass of detail about Kennedy's ailments, operations, hospitalisations and medications will depend in part on whether one sees Kennedy more as a scoundrel who lied to the voters about ailments that would make him unelectable today, or more as a dreadfully afflicted man who overcame his indignities to rise to the highest seat of power. On November 22, though, it is appropriate to record that were it not for a back brace, which held him erect, his head would not have provided such a clear target for the third shot that ended his life. If Dallek perhaps goes out of his way to underplay the genuine sense of newness and excitement that Kennedy ignited in so many countries as well as his own, he nevertheless provides a very balanced account of the famous Thousand Days, stressing the very limited domestic achievements of the presidency and the distinctly mixed record in foreign affairs. What would have happened had Kennedy lived is, of course, both a fascinating and pointless topic for discussion. That he would have comfortably defeated Barry Goldwater in 1964 seems likely, in which case he would have brought many liberals to the Senate and Congress on his coat-tails, and might have pushed through the same kind of civil rights reforms that Johnson, elected on a landslide in the wake of the assassination, was able to achieve. On Cuba, suggests Dallek, Kennedy was on a radical learning curve. The Bay of Pigs was a disgraceful episode, urged on - topically, in the post-Iraq context - by advisers and exiles who exaggerated the readiness of Cubans to rise up against Castro and in support of a US invasion. At the time of his death, Dallek suggests, Kennedy could have been moving towards a rapprochement with Cuba that might have had major long-term consequences for US foreign and domestic policy alike. The great unknowable, of course, is how Kennedy might have handled Vietnam, which was the defining political experience of Bill Clinton's generation and which therefore forms the backdrop to a large section of Nigel Hamilton's biography. Hamilton's is an ambitious undertaking, as it takes Clinton only to the threshold of the presidency that will form the subject matter of volume two (and who knows what a future volume three may yet contain?). Even so, this first volume is in sensitive territory throughout, since Clinton's background and early career were and perhaps still are a political battlefield, largely because conservatives chose to take their stand against his challenge on the man himself rather than on what he stood for. No other presidential candidate in history has had to fight such a cultural war about the kind of person he is. His contemporary, George W Bush, has had an unbelievably easy ride over his own early career (including his avoidance of the Vietnam draft) by comparison. But Hamilton, who has also written a successful book on the young JFK, is right to give a very prominent place to the Arkansas issue in the Clinton story. When conservatives rage against ""that man"" it is not just the libertinism or even the liberalism that provokes them. It is the fact that he comes from a small, poor state that almost the entire political establishment looks down on. It would be wonderfully ironic if Wesley Clark were to unseat Bush next November, since Arkansas would then have provided two of the last three presidents. Clinton is a man of paradoxes, and Hamilton delves deep into all of them. To some, Clinton is a serious and brilliant figure who understands the transformational character of modern times better than almost any other world leader of his era. To others, he is a man without principle or scruple whose primary and perhaps only importance is as a figure of gossip and entertainment. On the one hand, there are those who see Clinton as he sees himself, as a moderniser who reshaped his party and the role of government in changed times, and whose pivotal importance will only grow with time. On the other, there are those who see him as an emblematic politician of an essentially depoliticised era, in which the presidency is of diminished and diminishing importance. Perhaps the single most difficult question facing all those who try to sum up the Clinton years is the one that Hamilton will reach only at the end of his next volume. Did he reinvent and thus save the American progressive political tradition which he inherited from Bobby Kennedy, among others? Or is his achievement essentially opportunist, sacrificing progressive ideas and aspirations in favour of the desire to stay in office at any cost in a generally conservative country? The conventional view of Clinton is that he is a bad man but was a good president. Rather similar to the general verdict these days on John Kennedy, in fact. In both cases there are few who can agree on exactly how these two contrasting judgments can be meshed together, even now."
1,"Step Across this Line<br />by Salman Rushdie<br />Jonathan Cape £20, pp468 In a sense, we have forgotten Salman Rushdie. What happened to him takes a receding place in history. Long before the 9/11 terrorist onslaught against America, he was putting his own experience of Imam Khomeini's terrorist  fatwa against himself into perspective. 'One small, intellectually impoverished, pathetically violent assault on the values of [European] civilisation,' he called it in 1997, on the eighth anniversary of its being proclaimed. That solitary hell through which Rushdie lived has perhaps been burned out of popular memory by the vastly greater holocaust of 2001. Yet there is every reason to remember it as a facet - a foretaste, a warning - of the totalitarian Islamic fundamentalism now on the screen of political leaders throughout the free and not-so-free world. If the fatwa had to happen, it couldn't have been issued against a more desirable writer than Rushdie: desirable, that is, in his resilience, enviable in his mordant resistance, admirable in his courage, unquenchable in the eloquence of his defence of values the mullahs thought they had God's blessing to extinguish. Khomeini, for his own purposes, chose the wrong man. And besides, the  fatwa remained unfulfilled. Rushdie lived. He was terrified at first, being suddenly forced to lead a life of uncommon furtiveness and fear. But he seized the moment to show what had happened was not, at any rate, small. At the core of this collection of a decade's essays and journalism, quite rightly, are pieces recalling the events and insisting on the issues that transformed him from quite famous author into global celebrity. This is why Rushdie should never be forgotten. Freedom of speech, seamless and untrammelled, is what he fought for, beyond himself. And it was a hard fight, especially in Britain, his adopted country, where  The Satanic Verses, the casus belli for Iran's theological thugs, was written. Britain was better at protecting Rushdie than valuing him. Our security services and Special Branch are often called unsurpassed in the secret tasks they undertake, and their beneficiary, a writer not a royal, was unstinting in his gratitude. But other arms of the British state could not get to grips with what was really at stake. Ministers shrank from meetings, still less any kind of emotional engagement. Diplomats were regularly instructed not to consort with this Typhoid Mary of the diplomatic dance. John Major suddenly cancelled a long worked-for encounter in case it put an Iranian trade deal in jeopardy. This is the British political temperament: pragmatic, cautious, occupationally suspicious of intellectuals. When Tony Blair took a high moral tone in defence of Kosovo Albanians, and did actually go to their military rescue, Rushdie scorned him for his British inability to reach beyond 'decency' into an imaginative involvement with the Serbian massacres. A tough judgment. Political leaders sometimes deserve credit for acting well, even behind unpoetic words. But it's shaming to remember that it was the provincial premier of Ontario, not the Prime Minister of Britain, who first jumped on to a platform in solidarity with the beleaguered author, and Nordic, Czech and Portuguese leaders who showed the deepest European commitment to the axioms of John Stuart Mill. Like all collections of journalism, the Rushdie volume contains some material that doesn't quite justify being preserved in this way. There are some pretty minor pieces and what seem to me some rather strained excursions into soccer and rock music. Inevitably, too, with his unique personal story having worked its deforming effect on his reputation, a hostile critic might take issue with Rushdie's love of fame. He adores being received by mass audiences. He is worshipped wherever he goes. His ambivalence while being photographed by Richard Avedon seems a shade unconvincing. But what else to expect? As the antidote to unusual punishment suffered for a decade, celebrity is a justifiable reward for exile. What's striking, in the end, is not Rushdie's egotism but the lack of it. This, we remember, is a writer not a politician. He is the most assiduous reader of other people's work, a true and tireless man of literature paying close attention to the output of his international contemporaries. He tells us why he loved the work of Angela Carter, finely takes issue with JM Coetzee's  Disgrace, and, in one of his more important pieces, takes apart George Steiner's pessimism about the future of the novel. He's a total believer in the power of the word. Another curse of the  fatwa was to define him as a man of anger. To many people, that may be all there is to him. But what emerges from reading him in the round are sincerity and generosity, virtues seldom found in modern literary journalism. The other message, however, cannot be repeated too often. There were those, especially in Britain, who regarded what happened in 1989 as somehow being his fault. He, not his would-be assassins, became the villain, soaking up taxpayer's money - a charge he knocks down, pound by pound, in a useful footnote - and declining to show adequate admiration for the Conservative government of the time. Islamic fundamentalism was assaulting one author, but also every other author who might dare show contempt for that kind of Islam. The attack was on civilisation itself. As Rushdie is brave enough to assert, trying to disengage the events of 9/11 from Islam is an exercise in fanciful dishonesty. He takes that timid conceit apart. He is a calm, meditative and unswerving liberal on all important matters, whose own uncomfortable fate pre-figured the worse to come, and now illuminates it."
1,"Maggie<br />by Brenda Maddox<br />Hodder &amp; Stoughton £20, pp288 The personality of Margaret Thatcher is one of the best-known artefacts in the whole of recent British political history. It's years since there was any mystery about either her formation or her private character or, for that matter, about her marriage to the saintly Denis. Her ambition as a child, her priggishness as a teenager, her funless life in the chemistry labs at Oxford, her solemn declaration from an early age that she would become an MP, her earnest tooling round the Home Counties for a safe seat: all this is well known, as, even more so, is the impact her character had on her public life. What was long ago interesting has become, by reverent repetition, a deeply wearisome story.  So, why another biography by a well-respected author, offering 'the personal story of a public figure and a marriage at the heart of it'? The answer is a television series and the commercial explanation is therefore not to be ridiculed. The hard heads at ITV would not be giving four prime-time hours to films about Maggie that go over the familiar ground unless they believed there was one more tranche of box-office millions to be squeezed out. Perhaps I am over-estimating the boredom threshold of the British public.   To judge from Thursday's opener, the films, elegantly made, will have their interest. Some prodigious research has found bits and pieces of footage from the Grantham school-days. Familiar contemporaries have once again done a turn for the questing cameras, which dredge them dry of little insights. The object of Maddox's book seems to be to ensure that none of these is left on the cutting-room floor, even though they change absolutely nothing in the old picture.   Her broader technique, honestly and thoroughly documented, is to drain dry the published works of every other biographer and witness, beginning with the Lady herself, to build a picture of the personality as described therein. Naturally, therefore, there is nothing significant we did not know, though some cameos break through, of which my favourite pictures her on a skiing holiday with her young children, when she preferred the aprs-ski and assumed the all too credible role of club bore.   'Her favourite occupation was sitting at the bar after dinner with a liqueur and debating with anybody who would sit with her,' says a rare new witness. The drinking, indeed, becomes a cumulative feature. As Prime Minister, she always insisted on mixing the cocktails herself, and preferred whisky to gin through the night. And then there's the hair, my dear. An unceasing preoccupation that Maddox returns to again and again, to emphasise, not incorrectly, Thatcher's intense self-consciousness as a woman. But here, I think, in her determination to   press a feminine rationale for the book, Maddox overlooks a crucial layer of the meaning of Maggie.   It is true enough that this leader wanted to deploy every female quality at its most alluring. It is even truer that the Tory men who served close to her did not get over the culture shock of this   woman supplanting them. The jokes about Hilda, like the resentment at the virago, never stopped coming out. But the great British public, I believe, was different. Sure, they saw her as a woman, and many admired her for that.   The larger political fact was genderless. Her severity, her refusal to ingratiate, her lack of empathy, her sometimes terrible decisions, soon transcended everything. After the first few years, her politics, not her sex, were what entirely mattered.   The overstretched thesis appears in another way, in Maddox's apparent insistence that MT could not abide other women taking the limelight; a jealousy, she implies, that reached up to the Queen herself. I do not think this is so. She may have resented things she heard the Queen had been saying about the rigours of Thatcherism, but her awe before monarchy was inextinguishable. A minor royal once told me of increasingly mirthful scenes after the annual ritual at the Cenotaph, when she could be relied on to curtsey ever lower as the years went by, not only to the Queen but to many of her relations.   Maddox sketches in the big stories of the prime ministerial life, but essentially the book, like the ITV commitment to a four-part series, is tribute to a tendency that should be regretted. The obsession with the Thatcher personality has become a national disorder. While exposing nothing, it reflects once more the British disease of preoccupation with the past. Thatcher has joined the Tower of London and the roast beef of old England as a piece of the heritage industry, to be granted iconic inspection from time to time and even sanctified, as if we could never see her like again.   There is, I fear, more to come. Somewhere, her official biographer, Charles Moore, is finding time and researchers to labour over the formal record of the life, even after John Campbell has produced his own two meticulous volumes. Moore's work, written by an unflinching admirer, will be a book nobody needs. There will doubtless be papers and documents augmenting the already valuable quarrying material to be found in the Thatcher memoirs. But the stance, one may fairly predict, will be just this side of sycophancy.The icon will be immortalised, the character revered. As in life, so in death, Thatcher will not be granted the verdict of detached evaluation.   It is remarkable that, 12 years after she left power, no such work exists. There is no comprehensive account, historical and analytical, of what the Thatcher years did to Britain and the world. Where are the professors, where the large academic minds, doing justice to what can fairly be called an age? Or are they, too, mesmerised by a mere personality we need to get away from?"
