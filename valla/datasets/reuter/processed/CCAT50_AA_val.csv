23,"Australian oil and gas companies are being snapped up by foreign companies with an eye for undervalued stocks, but analysts said the sector faces a bright future with higher oil prices and a deregulated gas market.
During 1996, there has been about A$2.5 billion worth of takeovers announced in Australia's shrinking oil and gas sector and another A$600 million worth of asset sales as some non-oil and gas players quit the local oil and gas market.  
Analysts said local oil groups with low share prices and overseas assets have struck the eye of hungry foreign companies.
""Overseas people appreciate the value of oil and gas assets, particularly in southeast Asia, but I don't think the market is fully valuing these assets through the share prices,"" Timothy Savage, an oil and gas analyst at Hartley Poynton, told Reuters.
Mobil Corp's A$1.78 billion tilt for Ampolex Ltd in February was the largest bid made this year in the sector. British oil producers are also keen on local oil firms.  
Crusader Ltd was taken over mid-year by Clyde Petroleum Plc, while in the past month Premier Oil Plc has made a bid for Discovery Petroleum NL and Cairn Energy Plc has made a offer for Command Petroleum Ltd.
BT Securities oil and gas analyst Stuart Baker said most of the Australian oil groups that have attracted predator attention have been producers with oil assets offshore.
""It is no coincidence at all that the companies that have disappeared have been always companies that have endeavoured to build an overseas presence, and they have all without exception been taken over,"" Baker told Reuters.  
Analysts said the rise in the oil price this year had not been a reason for the corporate activity. NYMEX oil futures prices have risen almost 50 percent over the past five months to current levels of about US$25.50 a barrel.
""Takeovers have been a feature of this sector for years and it doesn't seem to matter if the oil price is up or down,"" Baker said.
Baker said oil companies making the bids have a double positive effect from the oil price rise with increased cash flow and a boost in share prices making it easier for companies to raise equity and debt.
Analysts said rationalisation might continue in the sector for some time, but most of the short-term activity had occured.
""I think it is possibly going to clam down now,"" one Sydney-based oil analyst said.
Analysts said remaining potential targets in the oil and gas sector were Cultus Petroleum Ltd and Petroz NL, which have assets in the prospective Timor Sea area.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Santos Ltd were unlikely bid targets, analysts said. Woodside, which accounts for nearly 50 percent of the A$12 billion sector, is controlled by oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
Santos is seen to have a restrictive share ownership structure making it difficult for takeovers, analysts said.
Santos has also been keen on purchases, buying A$250 million worth of oil assets this year from groups quitting the sector.
Analysts said the takeover activity has raised the focus on the sector, particularly in gas exploration and development.
They said reforms in the local gas industry has opened up opportunities for gas supplies to major mines in remote areas and the set up of co-generation projects around the country.
""There is a lot of money coming over here and finding their way into all sorts of corners of the industry. So it looks like it is going to be a fairly buoyant period again, irrespective of whether we have further takeovers ahead,"" Baker said.
Australia's oil and gas index hit a record high of 1459.5 on Tuesday, but fell slightly to close at 1432.9 on Wednesday.

23,"Australia's information technology and telecommunication industry (IT&amp;T) on Tuesday welcomed a decision by Asia-Pacific leaders that would lead to a substantial reduction in tariffs.
""It is certainly welcome, as the telecommunications area has some very strong barriers in many markets,"" said Fleur Bayley, export manager of the Australian Informational Industry Association (AIIA).  
Bayley told Reuters that Australia has no trade barriers on IT&amp;T equipment, whereas local companies have to compete in markets that have high tariff barriers.
The meeting in the Philippines of 18 leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies endorsed a United States plan to free the annual US$500 billion global trade in computers, memory chips and telecommunications equipment.
However, most IT&amp;T observers wanted more details about the tariff plan before they could assess its implications for the Australian sector.  
One computer industry analyst said the APEC plan is likely to benefit Australian IT&amp;T exports, but is unlikely to stimulate growth of technology imports into Australia.
""One would have thought with the relative maturity of our market that exports could increase faster than imports,"" the analyst said.
He said there could be a mild boost in demand from home users of computers, but it is unlikely to affect the demand in the corporate market.  
But another analyst said most of Australia IT&amp;T exports are from multinational corporations with operations in Australia and these companies are the ones that are most likely to benefit.
Australia exported more than A$2.5 billion in IT&amp;T goods in the 12 months to September this year but imported around A$9.6 billion worth of IT&amp;T goods over the same period.
U.S. computer giant International Business Machines Corp lBM exports about A$500 million of its computers from Australia to Asia, making it the country's single largest technology exporter.  
French telecommunictaions equipment maker Alcatel Alsthom is another multinational with large export volumes from Australia.
AIIA's Bayley said the association has a target of A$10 billion in IT&amp;T exports by the year 2000.
A decade ago, Australia's IT&amp;T exports were negligible.

23,"Canadian gold giant Placer Dome Inc on Tuesday agreed to a deal with Papua New Guinean (PNG) miner Highlands Gold Ltd that gives Placer control of the giant PNG Porgera gold mine and ends a bitter feud between the two miners.
The deal also keeps the Highlands group as a listed company free to develop base metal and gold projects in the resource rich South Pacific nation.
Under the complex plan the Vancouver-based miner would pay Highlands A$316.1 million (US$249.7 million) to buy Highlands' 25 percent stake in the Porgera mine, which is estimated to have produced 850,000 ounces of gold in calendar 1996.
Placer had previously offered Highlands A$276.8 million for its Porgera stake after building up a 40-percent stake in Highlands through a hostile takeover bid.
""We are pleased that Placer has accepted our offer,"" Highlands managing director Ian Goddard said in a statement.
The restructuring plan involves all shares in Highlands other than those held by Placer being cancelled and holders receiving a capital return of 65 cents cash per share and one share in Highlands Pacific.
""It's good for Placer Dome because it gets what it really wanted, it's good for Highlands shareholders because they get more than 75 cents, they get 65 cents cash plus they have the share in the new company,"" one source close to the deal said.
Highlands will spin-off a new company, Highlands Pacific Ltd, which would hold the Ramu nickel/cobalt and Frieda-Nena copper/gold projects as well as its exploration porfolio in PNG and Indonesia.
""There has been strong institutional interest in our proposal, which unlocks the value of Ramu, Frieda-Nena and Highlands' extensive exploration interests,"" Goddard said.
Under the restructure of the Highlands group about A$160 million would be raised through a mixture of new equity and the planned sale by Placer Dome of the shareholding it would inherit in Highlands Pacific.
The new equity issue in Highlands Pacific would be at 30 cents per share, Highlands Gold said. The newly-formed company would have a market capitalisation of about A$250 million when it lists on the Australian Stock Exchange in March.
Placer Dome already has effective control over the 25 percent stake in Porgera through its Australian offshoot Placer Pacific Ltd, which the Canadian miner plans to buy-out the remaining 24.6 percent stake in the Australian miner.
Placer Dome's orginal bid of 75 cents per Highlands share launched on November 28, 1996 was rejected by the PNG miner, which valued Highlands at A$423 million. Highlands had also threaten Placer with court action over its initial bid.
Investors welcomed the new deal.
In early afternoon trade Highlands shares were two cents up at 81 cents on active trade of about 14 million. While fellow Porgera partner Orogen Minerals Ltd touched a record high of A$3.05 on the news. Orogen holds 15 percent of Porgera.

23,"Rupert Murdoch's global media group, The News Corp Ltd, on Tuesday reported an 8.1-percent fall in net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97, in stark contrast to market expectations of a healthy rise.
But analysts said Murdoch's forecast last month at News Corp's annual meeting that the group would achieve a profit lift of 20 percent for the year to June 30, 1997 was still possible.
The film, television, publishing and newspaper conglomerate reported net profits of A$283 million (US$223 million) for the three months ended September 30, down from A$308 million a year earlier.
Analysts had forecast net profit before abnormal items would be around A$320-330 million, up around 15 percent.
Net profit before abnormals came in at A$285 million.
The poor result caused News Corp shares to fall sharply and dragged the whole Australian share market lower.
The share price fall wiped over A$300 million of the group's market capitalisation. The stock closed 18 cents or 2.52 percent lower at A$6.95 with over 4.7 million shares traded.
The weaker profit was a result of poorer returns in U.S. TV, Australian newspapers and book publishing, News Corp said.
""This is not as people were expecting type of result. It was a very flat result,"" one Sydney-based media analyst said.
News Corp could still report a 20 percent rise in net profits for the 1996/97 year as it was only the U.S. television business that was clearly below forecast, analysts' said. They said this forecast by Murdoch was in U.S. dollar terms.
In U.S. dollar terms, News Corp operating income was seven percent higher in the first quarter.
""Basically, what News has said is 'the first quarter was a bit disappointing but you are still going to get your growth for the year',"" one Melbourne-based analysts said after taking part in an analysts' conference telephone call with News Corp.
News Corp said its profit was mainly bolstered by the worldwide box office success of the science fiction movie Independence Day and its British newspapers and book publishing.
Independence Day, a film about invading aliens who launch an attack against the Earth from huge space ships, has grossed more than US$670 million worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film in box office history.
British newspaper operations enjoyed strong growth with an 18-percent gain in operating profits in the three months to September, News Corp said. The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times newspapers all posted gains in both advertising and circulation revenues in the first quarter.
""Additionally, the group has benefitted from reduced newsprint costs,"" the company said.
""Offsetting these gains were weaker results in U.S. television, Australian newspapers and book publishing, which lacked results from the educational division which was sold in March 1996,"" it said.
News also said continued losses for its Asian satellite broadcaster, STAR TV, were in line with expectations.
The fall in profit in Australian dollar terms also reflected the stronger local currency against the U.S. dollar as about 75 percent of News Corp's revenue is in U.S. dollars.
The first quarter profit drop follows a profit dip for News Corp in the 1995/96 year, when it reported a six-percent fall in pre-abnormals net profit to A$1.26 billion.

The analyst said he would likely cut his full year forecasts for News Corp from the current A$1.545 billion (excluding abnormals and before preference dividends). ""I can see myself shaving that back to about the A$1,500 (million) mark,"" he said.
However, asked if News Corp could meet Murdoch's forecasts, the analyst replied: ""I think so, because the rest of the result was perfectly in line with what we were going for, so they will have to work hard and if things go right for them they can.""

""It seems it's just a knee-jerk reaction to the first quarter, which looks like it was A$40 million below what the market was looking for,"" a Sydney broker said.
The analyst said the fall in Australian dollar terms also reflected the stronger local currency against the U.S. dollar as about 75 percent of News Corp's revenue is in U.S. dollars.
In U.S. dollar terms, News Corp operating income was seven percent higher in the first quarter.
The film, television, publishing and newspaper conglomerate reported a six percent fall in pre-abnormals net profit to A$1.26 million for the year to June 30, 1996.

23,"Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born mogul who turned his father's newspaper business into a global media empire, is publicly grooming the next generation to succeed him.
But the 65-year-old who has transformed the industry worldwide still has a few more ambitions to achieve before he passes on the baton to his heirs and settles into retirement.
Instead of rolling up their shirtsleeves and getting inked up on the printing presses as Rupert did, his eldest son Lachlan and daughter Elisabeth will be dealing with the latest in digital technology and multi-channel television satellites.
With the dawning of the digital age, television is the business that Murdoch sees fuelling the next stage of growth of the News Corporation Ltd conglomerate built from the small beginnings of his father Keith's Adelaide newspaper.
The TV business already produces the most revenue of News Corp's five main operations -- newspapers, magazines, films and book publishing. News Corp recorded total revenues of A$13.0 billion (US$10.27 billion) in the year to June 30, 1996.
NEWS CORP, A FAMILY BUSINESS
Lachlan, 25, and Elisabeth, 28, are already familiar with the television business. Elizabeth owned and operated two TV stations in California before selling them earlier this year to join British Sky Broadcasting Plc (BSkyB).
Murdoch's other son, James, and daughter Prudence are not involved in Dad's business, but his wife Anna is on the board of ""News"", which is about 32-percent owned by the Murdoch family.
""Obviously he is lining up people to help,"" said a Melbourne based media analyst.
At 65, Murdoch has passed News Corp's own retirement age but with the business just entering a new phase of expansion he is not about to leave yet.
""News Corp is still being formed, that is why there is not much chance of him walking away tomorrow,"" said the Melbourne analyst, referring to News Corp expansion in satellite and cable TV.
The analyst said either Elisabeth or Lachlan would probably work in News Corp's U.S. business, before they could take over.
At the start of October, Elisabeth was appointed head of programming at BSkyB, which is 40-percent owned by News Corp. The British-based satellite TV operation nearly sank News Corp in debt six years ago, but has become a river of cash.
A week before his sister's promotion, Lachlan was appointed managing director of News Ltd, the Australian arm of News Corp.
""Lachlan's job is to get pay TV up and running (in Australia),"" said one Sydney analyst of News Ltd's 50-percent interest in Foxtel, a cable TV network launched last year.
Murdoch has placed both his children under the tutorage of two of his loyal lieutenants, BSkyB managing director Sam Chisholm and News Ltd chairman Ken Cowley.
Most Murdoch watchers see Lachlan as the favourite to step into his father's shoes because of his appointment to the key 12-strong executive committee of News Corp, which is separate from the company's board of directors.
""You can't consider Elisabeth a real contender for the top job until she gets on that board,"" the Sydney media analyst said. He added that she would have to take Chisholm's job at BSky to get onto the executive committee.
""That is not going to happen for a while, whereas Lachlan has got the job of managing director of Australia and he is on the executive committee -- so that tells you who is the favourite right now,"" the analyst said.
Lachlan's growing confidence was evident recently at News Corp's annual meeting in Adelaide, where the Princeton graduate and rock climbing enthusiast firmly guided his father away from an impromptu press conference after the annual meeting.
The previous year the young Murdoch stayed firmly in the background as his father spoke about all.
""We have to go, I'm sorry,"" Lachlan told reporters firmly, ushering his father away once the questioning turned to the thorny matter of Australian media ownership rules.
EXPANSION THE NEW MURDOCH WAY
Since he inherited his father Keith's newspaper stable in 1952, Murdoch built his media empire by raising large slabs of debt -- often to the annoyance of his shareholders.
But in a move welcomed by analysts, Murdoch has said News Corp's future growth is likely to be based on a more conservative financing strategy.
""We now have US$2.5 billion in the bank and we intend to leave it there,"" Murdoch told News Corp's annual meeting.
This is a far cry from the dark days of late 1990 and January 1991, when Murdoch had to beg his bankers to get them to reschedule US$7.6 billion in debt after News Corp said it would be insolvent if the refinacing package was not completed.
Murdoch said News Corp's multi-billion dollar plans for pay television networks in the United States, Asia, Japan, Latin America and Australia would be financed from cash flow.
Analysts say Murdoch is unlikely to leave until he has widened News Corp's world television network reach and increased the company's reservoir of programming content.
""I think geographically he is almost there. There are only three areas he doesn't have exposure to, they are Canada, Africa and Eastern Europe,"" said one analyst.
""I don't think he is very interested in Eastern Europe, Canada is very difficult for foreigners from what I understand. But, I think there is a chance at some stage that Africa might be in his sights,"" the analyst added.
Murdoch will have to build up News Corp's programming further, particularly in film, analysts said. They said News is strong in sports and now news following the launch of the 24-hour a day Fox News channel launched on October 7.
""Sports, movies and news are the focus, but it wouldn't surprise me that he would have something to do with music as well at some stage,"" said a Melbourne-based analyst. ""If you think about the sort of content you can take from one country to another, sports is obviously one, then news and film and the other one to my mind would be music."" (A$1 = $0.79)

23,"U.S.-owned express freight carrier United Parcel Service (UPS) could start flying its own planes to Australia if growth in the Australian market continued at the current rate, a senior company official said on Friday.
UPS, which started serving Australia in 1991, currently uses commercial airlines to carry packages in and out of the country, UPS general manager Australia Terry Hales said in an interview.
""If things continue the way they are I could see very quickly the realisation of that ..."", Hales said.
""It is certainly not beyond the terms of possibility at all. I would say that we have a plan that it would happen in the next five years,"" he said.
UPS does not use its own planes, which currently total 300 worldwide, to fly to Australia as there was not enough export business from Australia, he said.
""We don't fly planes into Australia. The market is not yet large enough to warrant bringing in an airplane every day full up and then turn them around and fly them back,"" Hales said.
""We have no problems filling them up coming in. Going out is another matter on a regular basis,"" he said.
Hales said Australia imports four times as much air freight as it exports. However, he said UPS projects large export growth, albeit from a low base in Australia.
""Our volume of revenue forecasts are in the region of 34 percent (growth) in calendar 1997,"" he said.
The import business is seen growing at a more modest pace.
""We still feel fairly bullish that we will still grow in the (import) market, probably seven or eight percent which is reasonable for the business,"" he said.
UPS uses Australia as a service centre rather than a hub for the Asia Pacific. Hales said UPS was spending US$400 million on its Asia Pacific hub terminal in Taiwan, which was chosen due to its proximity to other Asian nations and the United States.
""When you sit down and work out the best location to service the customers, in our case we came out with Taiwan as the best location for the Asia Pacific,"" Hales said.
However, he did not rule out Australia becoming an Asian Pacific hub in the future.
UPS currently uses Honolulu as a connection point for freight bound for Australia.
Cargo is transferred to a Qantas Airways Ltd flight to carry it the rest of the way to Australia.
But this could change in the future if growth continued at the current pace, Hales said.
Atlanta-based UPS is privately owned.

23,"Media mogul Rupert Murdoch said on Tuesday he intended to use sports broadcasting rights as a ""battering ram"" for dominance of pay television markets in Asia and throughout the world.
He said the purchase of those rights would also buy his way into the world's sporting establishment.
""Sport absolutely overpowers film and everything else in the entertainment genre,"" Murdoch told shareholders at the annual meeting of News Corp, his global media group.
""We have the long-term rights in most countries to major sporting events and we will be doing in Asia what we intend to do elsewhere in the world, that is, use sports as a ""battering ram"" and a lead offering in all our pay television operations,"" said Murdoch, News' chairman and chief executive.
News Corp has spent big money on acquiring sports programming rights worldwide over the last five years and has set up sports programme distribution deals with some of the industry's biggest players in the past 12 months.
Murdoch's global media and entertainment group set up a worldwide sports programming joint venture with U.S. cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc (TCI) and Liberty Media of the United States in January.
Two weeks ago, News Corp formed an Asian sports programming joint venture with its former competitor Walt Disney Inc's sports broadcaster ESPN.
""Sport will remain very important and we will be investing and acquiring long-term rights and becoming part of the world sports establishment,"" said Murdoch, News' chairman and chief executive.
""Football, of all sports, is number one,"" said Murdoch, who sails as a sporting pastime.
News Corp has spent millions on football programming rights over the past few years. It has bought the rights for the National Football League (NFL) in the U.S. and Premier League soccer in the United Kingdom and is setting up its rebel rugby league competitions in Australia and Europe.
""We expect the next three World Cups will have a significant place on our platforms,"" said Murdoch referring to the soccer and Rugby Union world cups.
Murdoch received a boost to his Australian sports broadcasting plans two weeks ago, when the Australian Federal Court overturned a Court ruling in March that banned the launch of News' rebel rugby league competition, Super League. News Corp's Australian offshoot has spent A$273 million (US$216 million) on setting up Super League.
""There has been an unfortunate hold-up, but it (Super League) is going to be a wonderful asset to have now that we are free to get that competition under way,"" said Murdoch, who is Australian-born, but now holds U.S. citizenship.
The group's sports programmes are broadcast through its vast television operations, which reach accross the United States and into parts of Latin America.
In Europe, News Corp's main TV interest is through its 40-percent stake in British Sky Broadcasting Plc (BSkyB), which announced sharply-increased pre-tax profits of 257 million pounds sterling (US$406 million) for the year to June 30.
News Corp operating profits for the same period were A$1.26 billion. Television, which contributed A$549 million, was the most profitable sector.
In Asia, News' satellite TV operator STAR TV broadcasts throughout Asia from Saudi Arabia to Japan. In Australia, News Corp has a 50-percent stake in the Foxtel cable TV joint venture and a 15-percent stake in TV broadcaster Seven Network Ltd.

23,"Australia's second largest bank Westpac Banking Group renewed its interest in Asia on Wednesday through an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank, 3-1/2 years after its sold a swag of its Asian units.
The move signals Westpac is ready to expand in Asia again after largely withdrawing from the region to focus on Australia and New Zealand during the last Australian recession.
Under the alliance Westpac and Standard Chartered would share banking services for medium-to-large scale corporate customers in their respective dominant markets of Australia and New Zealand and Asia.
Westpac chief executive Bob Joss said in a statement that the initiative was of major importance to Westpac.
""It is a good strategic fit for our future growth,"" he said. Standard Chartered group chief executive Malcolm Williamson said his bank was committed to ""ensuring this new relationship with Westpac is of significant long-term benefit to both companies"".
The venture would focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China in about six months, said David Morgan, group executive of Westpac's Institutional and International Banking.
""Initially the main purpose of this relationship is to provide select Asian banking services to Westpac's medium to large customers -- including cash management services, local Asian currency lending, local transaction facilities and trade finance facilities,"" the banks said in a joint statement.
The banks expect quick success from the alliance.
""We expect it to be a fairly rapidly growing revenue stream,"" Morgan told Reuters.
Westpac reported a A$16 million (US$12.8 million) profit in the year to September 30, 1996 from its Asian operations compared with A$10 million in 1994/95.
But, Morgan said he could not say how much revenue the alliance would produce in its first year of business or how much Westpac had invested in the venture, which started on Wednesday.
""We have made a substantial investment already, but it is going to be a continuing investment as we expand our capabilities across Asia,"" Morgan said.
The move was a cheap way of getting into Asia by Westpac, banking analysts said. ""It gives them access to markets in a fairly cost effective way,"" said Graham Maloney, banking analyst at brokers Macquarie Equities. ""It's a good thing. It gives them exposure to an area that is very fast growing.""
Westpac has banking licences is some Asian countries, but its activities are limited, Westpac's Morgan said.
Traders welcomed news of the alliance pushing Westpac shares up two cents to A$7.36, while the overall market was lower.
The link with Westpac follows Standard Chartered's Asian pact formed with the U.S. First Chicago NBD Corp last week.
""They (Standard Chartered) are obviously looking around the region for alliances,"" one Melbourne-based analyst said.
Westpac's alliance with Standard Chartered also comes ahead of an inquiry into Australia's finance and banking industry, which could see further deregulation and some mega-mergers.
The inquiry's final report is due next March.
Last month, speculation mounted that Standard Chartered was looking at a merger with another Australian bank, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), but this was denied by Melbourne-based ANZ. (AUD=US$0.80)

23,"Australian government-owned airport operator Federal Airports Corp (FAC) sees some life after the planned privatisation of its 22 airports, chief executive officer Barry Murphy said.
""We will eventually go out of existence if all 22 airports that we currently own and operate are eventually disposed of to other owners,"" Murphy told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""One thing we do hope will survive is our service group called the FAC Airport Consultancy, which we are trying to build into a viable business for the long run,"" Murphy said.
Murphy said FAC Airport Consultancy would be a group of 20 or 30 people, with specialist knowledge of the aviation industry and property management.
""We hope to sell those services at arm's length to the remaining airports and to new airport owners,"" Murphy said.
The Australian government has 10 consortiums shortlisted for bidding in its first sale phase which consists of 50-year leases for Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. These are expected to sold in early 1997.
The sale of Adelaide lease was supposed to be part of the first phase, but was delayed for an upgrade.
The remaining 18 airports, including Sydney and the yet-to-be-built second airport at Sydney, will be sold in one or more future tranches.
""By the year 2000 I would imagine that they would have all gone with the possible exception of Sydney, if that is held back because of the Olympics,"" Murphy said.
Sydney will host the 2000 Olympics Games.
Murphy said the sale timetable was uncertain and the whole process was quite unsettling for FAC staff, as one of the major problems for the corporation was staff leaving to join the various consortiums.
Former FAC chief executive Jack Moffatt is the acting chief executive of Australian Airports Ltd, a consortium bidding for Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.
In late November, FAC reported a 14.5 percent rise in net profit to A$78.1 million in the year to June 30, 1996 on a 14.6-percent rise in revenue to A$579.3 million, while passenger volume at the airports grew 7.3 percent.
""Passenger growth seems to be holding up quite well and we are expecting a continuing strong performance in that area...and we are hopeful that kind of growth rate will continue,"" Murphy said.
""We are confident that revenue growth would follow similar growth.""
Murphy said the FAC would try to minimise capital expenditure ahead of its privatisation, although Sydney airport may need to be upgraded. ""We do expect significant work at Sydney to cater for terminal growth within in the two years.""
Sydney is Australia's busiest airport.
Murphy said the FAC had been in talks with freight operators with a view to expand freight facilities at some of Australias airports.
""It is apparent now that freight is attracting more interest,"" Murphy said. However, he added any expansion of freight facilities was unlikely to involve major sums of money.

27,"China has missed a golden opportunity to export corn and earn millions of dollars, and now has up to a million tonnes of the grain rotting in silos in the country's north, Far East traders said on Tuesday.
""This year is going to be a major disaster,"" a Hong Kong trader said.
""All that corn sitting in Dalian is just rotting,"" he said, adding his estimate that 500,000 to one million tonnes of corn was stored in northern silos in anticipation of exports.
Corn, grown predominantly in China's far northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, began moving to northern ports, particularly Dalian, around May, traders said.
""People had geared up for a huge export programme and I think the traditional northeast suppliers anticipated two million tonnes being permissioned for export,"" a trader in Singapore said.
Concern about national food security and the impact on domestic prices that exports would have in an atmosphere of acute inflationary paranoia had kept China out of the world corn market, trading sources said.
Corn and rice exports were banned in December 1994 after stocks fell to frighteningly low levels in a country where the governing Communist Party bases much of its ruling mandate on availability and affordability of staple foods.
Imports soon began, totalling 5.18 million tonnes in 1995. Corn imports in the first five months of 1996 were 400,000 tonnes, customs figures show.
Expectations began building in April that China's central grain authorities would allow corn exports to take advantage of high world prices and also to ease a local surplus and push up softening domestic prices. Prices had dropped below $120 a tonne in some areas.
Word at the time from traders involved in negotiations with China's central grain reserve on what nature the exports should take -- barter or cash -- was that the corn would be sold mostly to Japan and South Korea at around $180 a tonne.
""There was a stage when they could have got $180, and from the inverse they could have picked up $20 a tonne selling FOB (free on board) and picking up from the U.S. six months later,"" the Singapore trader said. ""They missed a big opportunity.""
A few hundred thousand tonnes of Chinese corn was sold to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, or bartered for equipment supplied by Japanese food processing corporations as part of joint-venture deals, industry sources said.
China's government, however, remained adamant that the export ban had not been lifted.
Officials of the newly-established Jilin Grain Group, set up by the Jilin provincial government and opened for business on Monday, told Reuters the province had its biggest stockpile in history, some three million tonnes.
The company was applying for the right to import and export corn ""in order to solve the problem of huge corn stockpiles,"" an official of the company said.
Official figures put 1995 corn production at 101 million tonnes. Output in 1996 has been projected by media to hit 112 million tonnes. Annual demand is 100-115 million tonnes.
Traders and grain industry sources have said China's total corn reserves are up to 30 million tonnes.
Traders said that while owners of the corn stocked at northern ports such as Dalian, Yingkou and Qinghuangdao had lost money on transport, storage and deterioration, the grain was now slowly being absorbed back into the domestic market.

27,"Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses, confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate, probably belongs to China's strategic state reserve, industry sources said on Friday.
Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where some of the strategic stockpile was stored, they said.  
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) in June and July.
It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve, administered directly by the central government's State Planning Commission, owned the copper.
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise.  
But one source, the head of a Hong Kong trading house, said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not.
""If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou, it will be sitting there for years,"" he said.
""Once it arrives in Yingkou, it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission, which has to give permission for any more movement; it is out of the hands of traders,"" he said.
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months, with traders unsure not only of who owns it, but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it.  
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price.
CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve, running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously.  
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$2,700 a tonne, and then paid somewhere between $2,200 and $2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year.
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit, which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs.
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market.  
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics (BME) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes, ""whoever they are, is the most important short-term fundamental"" in an already tight world market.
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp, with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals.
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement.  
Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses. They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases.
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market.
But these concerns were irrelevant, a Singapore trader said, despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year.  
As with many commodities, ""there is a desire (by the Chinese government) to keep a stockpile of the metal,"" he said. ""You don't keep it to help industry, you keep it in case of emergency.""

27,"Chile, the world's biggest copper exporter, hopes to forge close trade and technical support ties with China, the world's biggest copper importer, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mariano Fernandez said.
""There is Chinese interest in participating in some mining projects in Chile, and we have an interest in participating in service and technology in copper mining in China,"" Fernandez told Reuters in a recent interview.
Of Chile's total 1995 mining exports worth US$7.85 billion, $280 million was earned from selling copper to China, he said.
""It is not only potential ... this is reality,"" he said. ""If we look ahead, there are some forecasts that in five years we will produce almost one-third of the world's total copper.
""But looking at 1.2 billion (Chinese) people and the rush for development in China, we should not exclude China as a very important client for Chilean copper.""
Chile, with 25 percent of world copper reserves, mined 2.512 million tonnes of the red metal in 1995, far ahead of its closest rival the United States, with 1.8 million, and fifth placed China with 435,000 tonnes, Chilean figures show.
Copper accounted for 36.4 percent of Chile's total exports in 1995 of $16.5 billion, the figures show.
China's 1996 demand for copper has been officially put at one million tonnes.
Its copper imports for 1996 were expected to be 200,000 tonnes, the president of China Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corp, Wu Jianchang, said in May.
Trade and industry sources have speculated recently about China's interest in buying copper properties in Chile, along similar lines to recent investment by major Chinese corporations in Peru's iron ore industry.
But one source with a major regional producer said the high price of Chilean copper mines, combined with a cash squeeze in China and the poor international reputation of Chinese buyers, would keep Chilean producers reluctant to forge long-term ties.
""I don't see China guaranteeing long-term supply contracts,"" the industry executive, based in Hong Kong, said.
""It is not the way they work because if the prices fall, they are then very reluctant to pay,"" he said. He was referring to the practice of some Chinese importers of refusing to pay for commodities if the price falls between order and delivery.
Fernandez did not elaborate on the details of cooperation Chile was hoping for with China. ""We are at the beginning (of discussions),"" he said.
He was in Hong Kong after a four-day trip to Beijing where he met with senior Chinese officials, including Minister for Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen and Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi.
The purpose of his visit was to lay the groundwork for a visit to Chile on November 6 and 7 by Chinese Premier Li Peng, he said.
Fernandez said he asked Chinese officials to consider recognising Chile as free of Mediterranean fruit fly, as Japan had already done, and free of foot-and-mouth disease.
""The Chilean dream is to sell one apple, one bunch of grapes and one bottle of wine a year to every Chinese person,"" he said.
"
27,"Casualties are starting to mount as Chinese buyers of soybeans and soybean meal default or cancel contracts in the wake of falling international prices, Asian trading sources said on Thursday.
""We have stopped doing Chinese business for now,"" said a trader in Hong Kong with a major international house.
""We're waiting for the market to stabilise and are staying away from the possibility of defaults,"" he said.
Traders in Hong Kong, Singapore and China reported hearing of Chinese soymeal buyers delaying finance arrangements for orders in an attempt to force sellers to lower their prices.
Another Hong Kong source reported that Chinese buyers had defaulted on three to four cargoes, each of 50,000 tonnes, since last week when international prices began to fall.
""They are defaulting because PRC buyers delayed opening LCs (letters of credit) in the hope of squeezing another two or three dollars from their sellers,"" he said.
Traders have said these tactics are next to useless as physical soymeal for prompt delivery is tight, and would command a premium that would wipe out any extra profit.
Since entering the international trading arena earlier this decade, Chinese traders have earned themselves a reputation for dubious practices when it comes to paying for their orders.
In some cases, traders have reported, a Chinese buyer will default on or cancel an order for a commodity if the price falls after the order is placed and before it is delivered.
The Chinese company will then attempt to replace the commodity at the cheaper rate.
As a result, when prices of a commodity that is a hot item in China begin to fall, some international traders simply exit the market.
Others insist on deposits, and others grade Chinese traders according to their record of paying up and charge higher premiums accordingly.
Soybean meal has been the hot Chinese commodity of 1996, traders said, with arrivals from South America around 1.2 million tonnes since February.
Traders said maximum Chinese orders of U.S. meal in the past two weeks were 300,000 tonnes.
One trader claiming to have done 400,000 tonnes of beans and meal business in the past two weeks said he had letters of credit from his buyers for 350,000 tonnes.
His sales would show up in U.S. Department of Agriculture figures this week, he said.
The price of soybean meal on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has been on a rollercoaster ride since late September, and initially dipped while China was on holiday from September 30 to October 3 celebrating National Day.
On October 4, Chinese buyers scooped up more than 600,000 tonnes of beans and meal, mostly of U.S. origin, some South American, paying $300 to $310 a tonne, traders said.
But last Friday, prices started to fall again, by Tuesday coming off another $10 or so a tonne -- and word of Chinese cancellations and defaults began to circle.
Reports from Chicago on Wednesday described the market as perplexed over rumours China had bought or cancelled export orders for U.S. and Latin American soybeans and soymeal.
CBOT October soymeal closed at $236.30 a tonne, after Tuesday's $235.30.
"
27,"Copper stored in Shanghai warehouses -- the murky ownership of which has cast a pall of concern over the world market -- is being offered in small lots to European trading houses, industry sources said on Thursday.
The copper is been offered for sale at a high premium in order to set a benchmark price for its eventual sale to China's strategic stockpile, one Chinese trader said.  
Traders said that estimates of copper reserves brought into China in recent months range between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes. A European trader in Beijing said he had been offered copper by the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) at around $2,100 a tonne -- a level reflecting the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price plus a premium of $130.
CNIEC has declined to comment on the market talk.
The copper was said to be owned by Chinese trading firms which had shipped it to Shanghai in the expectation that the central stockpile would buy this amount to square its position on metal previously lent to the market, before the end of 1996.  
""They are hoping that it is the right tonnage in the right place, but as far as we know, the stockpile has so far not confirmed they will buy it,"" a Chinese trader with a state-owned Chinese firm, said.
Traders said last week the copper probably belonged to China's state reserve, which lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper, through CNIEC, onto the LME between April and June 1995.
In March this year, CNIEC's former president Fang Dachang said China was likely to take it back in the fourth quarter.  
But when copper began to move back to China in June and July, from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, Singapore and Long Beach, California traders assumed the central reserve was taking the copper back earlier than planned.
Not so, said the Chinese trader, though he added: ""Who owns it is anyone's guess.""
The metal was taken from LME warehouses at about $2,400 a tonne, a Hong Kong trader said, with the price set before three month LME copper prices slid below $1,800 on news in June of $1.8 billion in copper trading losses by Japan's Sumitomo Corp.  
Three month copper was indicated at $1,942/45 a tonne in late LME trade on Wednesday.
""It (the copper) has been sitting there for a couple of months, so someone has to pick up the loss,"" a trader said.
""Whether the stockpile takes this tonnage from this owner, or if they buy it themselves and arrange another shipment themselves, is up to them,"" the Chinese trader said.
""But it depends on the price. If they (the stockpile) can get a premium lower than $100, maybe they will take it. They won't pay $150, or $120, especially on this sort of tonnage.""  
A trader in Shanghai said CNIEC would ""dearly love someone to take the whole lot, but that is unrealistic"".
But the Chinese source said: ""This copper can only be taken by the stockpile"" because no other buyer could afford it.
China levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax on copper imports, which traders said made it prohibitively expensive.
Freight, warehousing and other costs would put the Shanghai copper in the same cost bracket as copper shipped to the region from LME warehouses in Europe or the Americas if the premiums being asked were paid, traders said.  
""The whole market is still being manipulated by somebody,"" a Chinese source said. ""The game is not over.""  
Other traders, in Asia and in Europe, have told Reuters that CNIEC had offered them copper in a series of secret meetings held in major Chinese cities since June.
About 40,000 tonnes was said by traders in China to have been shipped already to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where the strategic stockpile has some warehouses. This has not been confirmed.
Another 20,000 tonnes of copper was stored in Shanghai Metal Exchange warehouses in the eastern port city, and the remainder of the metal was in other Shanghai stores, traders said.

27,"Shanghai-born tycoon Tung Chee-hwa claimed victory for himself and for the Chinese nation on Wednesday when he won the race for Hong Kong's future leader.
""For the past 100 years, Hong Kong has been a colony. Now we are in charge of ourselves. I believe most Hong Kong people have confidence in the future,"" said Tung.
""Some people still have worries, but I want to remind them that people walk the road together, success lies with the people and comes from their efforts,"" he said.
""I believe everyone should be clear that we want a better Hong Kong, a better future,"" Tung said.
Tung was elected by the Selection Committee, a panel of 400 members handpicked by Beijing, to be Hong Kong's Chief Executive once the colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.
In a short, prepared victory speech, Tung, 59, stressed pragmatism and stability and downplayed democracy.
While noting Hong Kong's rule of law, spirit of freedom and strong civil service, Tung said it was important to secure a smooth transition for the colony from British to Chinese rule.
""I believe we can do better than before, based on the one country-two systems policy and under the protection of the Basic Law,"" Tung said.
He was referring to Beijing's policy for letting Hong Kong's capitalist system continue after it comes under the communist government's jurisidiction, and to its post-1997 constitution.
That Tung would be the man to take on Hong Kong's leadership yoke after the departure of the last British governor, Chris Patten, had been widely seen as a foregone conclusion.
The shipping magnate heads a family empire that was bailed out of financial difficulties by China a decade ago.
In the first round of voting by the 400-member Selection Committee, Tung took 206 votes. On Wednesday, he won 320 votes.
His speech was delivered at Hong Kong's Convention Centre immediately after his victory was declared by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who said Tung had become Hong Kong's most democratically elected leader to date.
The voting process, long criticised as undemocratic and unrepresentative of Hong Kong's six million people, was a step forward on the colony's road to democracy, Tung said.
""People may have differing opinions about the pace of democratic change in Hong Kong, but today, under the Basic Law, I believe we are making the first step towards democracy and this is most suitable for Hong Kong's situation,"" Tung said.
""This is a good start,"" he said. ""Today we elect our own chief executive and in the future, we will follow the Basic Law and the actual situation of our society, step by step, to push democracy forward,"" he said.
He called on Hong Kong's political parties not to politicise issues but to work together for the sake of their country and for all Chinese people.
Demonstrations were part of Hong Kong culture, he said, but people should instead sit down and discuss their grievances.
Tung emphasised public welfare reform and called for a long-term re-examination of education, welfare for the elderly and industry policy.
He was leaving for Shenzhen, a Chinese special economic zone on Hong Kong's border, later on Wednesday, where he was expected to receive China's official blessing as Hong Kong's next leader.

27,"China's zinc industry is fast succumbing to the rigours of reform, as mines and smelters find that surviving without government grace is difficult and the ways of the world are tough, Far East traders said on Monday.
Withdrawal of government subsidies, combined with tight credit, expensive infrastructure and utilties, and over-manned mines and smelters mean the industry is struggling to compete.
Chinese zinc exports have slowed as Chinese sellers are unwilling to lower their prices to world levels, traders said.
""The Chinese are asking high premiums -- LME (London Metal Exchange) plus US$70 to Hong Kong and Taiwan,"" one said.
Three month LME zinc was quoted at $1,036/$1,038 a tonne in early trade on Monday up slightly from Friday's $1,033 close.
Many Asian customers bought zinc heavily in late 1995 and still have stock to consume before they look to China, a Hong Kong trader said.
Nor is China importing much zinc, as a 10 percent import duty and a value-added tax of 17 percent made it too expensive for cash-starved smelters, traders said.
July customs figures show China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys dropped to 117,293 tonnes in the first seven months of 1996, down 7.1 percent on the same year-ago period.
The January-May export figure of 86,494 tonnes was down 25.5 percent on the corresponding period in 1995.
An executive with an Australian firm said the problems faced by the Chinese industry would take a long time to resolve.
Expansions planned some years ago had not been costed on world terms, he said, but on the local supply of raw materials that were sold at a set price.
So when mine depletion and rising demand became evident and forced China to look outside for raw materials, ""they found it was very expensive, much more expensive than they expected.""
As China's economy has grown at about 10 percent a year, zinc consumption is maintaining a growth rate of about eight percent, the Commodities Research Unit (CRU) said in a report.
Zinc output has risen faster than consumption and enabled China to become a net exporter of about 200,000 tonnes of slab in 1995 -- after being an importer 10 years earlier of 200,000 tonnes, CRU figures show.
U.K.-based CRU put China's 1994 mine output at 949,000 tonnes of zinc.
China's influence on the world market is expected to continue, despite reduced exports, an analyst at Billiton Metals in London said in July.
China's refined zinc exports in 1995 totalled 164,000 tonnes, compared with 222,000 tonnes in 1994, the analyst, Karen Norton said. London brokers T Hoare &amp; Co put China's average yearly exports in the previous five years at 70,000 tonnes.
The Chinese government is gradually withdrawing subsidies to mines and smelters in line with requirements for membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), trading sources said.
""The zinc price is down, but the Chinese are getting a double whammy with subsidies disappearing,"" the Australian source said.
""They can't lay people off, but they have to make money -- so what can they do?"" he said.
""The real issue is that the smelters have to become competitive, and this means redundancies... So even though they are free to run the smelters as free enterprises, it would be a brave man to be the first to stick his hand up and say he is going to lay off a couple of thousand workers.""
Capacity in China will remain under-utilised, while expansion elsewhere will further pressure the industry.
""The Chinese will have to compete, and their competitors will be leaner and meaner,"" the Australian source said.

27,"Asian traders raised their eyebrows on Monday at reports that China had bought hundreds of thousands of tonnes of soybean oil, saying authorities had issued import licences for only a fraction of that.
""Total quota issued (for soybean oil imports) were a little over 100,000 tonnes,"" a trader in Shanghai said.
""People with quota are not in a hurry to import,"" he said, because c&amp;f (cost and freight) prices to China were still too high for local buyers.
A Chinese trader in Hong Kong concurred, saying high domestic stocks and a near-record domestic rapeseed crop of eight million tonnes meant there was as yet no demand in China for imported vegetable oil.
Rumours swept the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on Friday that China may have bought 173,000 to 200,000 tonnes of South American soybean oil in the previous few days.
Argentine soybean oil was trading on Thursday at US$500 a tonne FOB (free on board) for October delivery while U.S. soybean oil was $510 a tonne, sources in the U.S. said.
Asian traders said these levels were still a good $40 away from prices Chinese buyers would be willing to pay.
But an official of Beijing's food trading arm China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp (COFCO) told Reuters China had not yet issued new soybean oil quota or import licences for 1996.
Quotas for 1995 had expired at the end of June, she said. Palm oil import quotas had been issued in July, she said, but declined to give more details.
China could come into the market for vegetable oil late in 1996 or early in 1997 to make sure there was enough in stock for Chinese New Year in February, traders said.
A Chinese source said 140,000 tonnes of soyoil import licences were issued by central authorities in August.
He said 50,000 tonnes of soyoil had already been imported on that quota, and 40,000 tonnes of quota had been allocated to Tibet so licences could be sold there for cash.
Authorities in Tibet, contacted by telephone, said they were unaware of this.
One trading house source in the region reported a busy day on the telephone on Monday, fielding Chinese inquiries for soybean oil. He thought perhaps this was an indication quota had been issued.
Relevant officials with the Ministry of Agriculture could not be immediately reached for comment.
An executive with an international marketing organisation who met Shanghai grain bureau officials last week said they had no indication of when import quotas for vegetable oil would be issued.
""They said they were going to apply for licences, but they had no idea when they were likely to be issued,"" she said by telephone.
Prices quoted last Thursday by the National Grains and Oils Information Centre in Shanghai put grade one soybean oil in northeastern Jilin province at 7,000 yuan ($843) a tonne, and grade two in Tianjin at 7,200 yuan ($867) a tonne.
Freight information from Brazil details 18,000 tonnes of vegetable oil due to be loaded for China in early October. No other details were available.
Soyoil imported into China without an import licence carries a 120 percent import tax. Importers with licences must pay 13 percent import duty and a 13 percent value-added tax on top of that.

27,"China has banned imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears the meat carries a fowl plague, a U.S. embassy official in Beijing said Wednesday.
The ban threatens an export market worth about $500 million a year.
""China has placed a ban on imports of all poultry and poultry products from 10 states,"" the official said.
Chinese authorities had voiced fears the poultry products carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, he said.
The states affected are Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Utah Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.
The U.S. embassy official, who asked not to be identified, said there seemed to be some confusion on the part of Chinese quarantine officials over the difference between HPAI and avian influenza, or AI.
""HPAI has not been found in the U.S. since 1984 and we believe there has been some confusion about the type of AI virus found in the United States and noted by China,"" he said.
A U.S. quarantine official based in China told Reuters last week that the virus could not be transmitted to people who ate the meat of infected birds.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products. It is the only market for U.S. chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tons transshipped through Hong Kong alone, worth $445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Every day 30 23-ton containers of U.S. chicken feet crossed the border from Hong Kong into China, according to the council's spokeswoman, Sarah Li.
The AI virus could be found worldwide, particularly in wild fowl, the embassy official said, and had not been isolated from commercial poultry flocks in the United States.
Another U.S. official told Reuters the AI virus may have been detected in ostriches imported from the United States as breeding stock on Chinese ostrich farms.
""Ostrich raising in China has become very popular and a lot of the breeding stock is brought in from the U.S.,"" the marketing official said.
""We heard that some of the ostrich breeding stock had been found to have AI,"" said the official, who requested anonymity.
News of the ban surfaced last week and was confirmed by Chinese quarantine officials to the U.S. embassy on Friday.
Officials of China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing met Tuesday in an effort to resolve the issue, the embassy official said.
""It was a frank, candid and open meeting -- they listened to us and agreed that we should talk more about it, which we will as soon as possible,"" the official said.
""Basically, we said we think there's been a misunderstanding, but they said what if it (the AI virus) mutates? We said it didn't and they rejected that,"" he said.
Officials of the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were to travel from the United States to meet their Chinese counterparts, but no date had been fixed.

8,"Japanese car giant Nissan Motor Co is expected to make a decision on whether to go ahead with building a new medium-sized vehicle for the European market in spring 1997, according to the head of its UK operations.
Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor UK and vice-president of Nissan Europe, said in an interview with Reuters he would be presenting his plan to the Nissan board in Tokyo next spring.
But he added that the investment size, design details and production were yet to be thrashed out. Gibson said it was still an open verdict on whether the plan would go ahead.
Speaking from the British Internaitonal Motor Show in Birmingham, he said the new car would be between its small Micra and larger Primera, based on the Almeira model which is currently manufactured in Japan and shipped to Europe.
""If we build the car in Europe, the design and develoment is purely for a model destined for Europe, not one that has to include a number of viewpoints for world export.""
""We will do it from scratch if it goes ahead,"" said Gibson.
But he added that if the decision is given the go-ahead next year it would mean moving up to 100,000 units of capacity from Japan into Europe.
""The question is what opportunities are there for Japan to use that excess capacity for something else?""
Gibson said this was part of the equation in the decision but refused to outline what options the Japan headquarters were looking at in terms of ""new models and new markets.""
If Nissan does decide to build the new model in Europe it would be manufactured in the UK or Spain.
Gibson was circumspect about the cost of developing and putting the new model on sale, saying ""I can't see it happening for less than 200 million (stg). But that's the absolute minimum.
He refused to cite a top end figure, but separately spoke of the general industry cost of building and marketing a new vehicle, estimating it at between one and three billion stg.
On Nissan's European sales for 1996, Gibson said there would be a modest rise, predicting three percent sales growth for 1997.

8,"The story of Sea Launch sounds like the daring fiction of a Bond movie -- with corporate giants from Russia, the U.S., Norway and Ukraine joining forces to build the ultimate in space technology, firing satellite rockets into space from the Pacific Ocean.
The cost is 350 million pounds ($583.2 million), funded by a consortium of four firms, joining the East and West in a deal which claims it can undercut the cost of land-based launchers including the French-led Ariane, recently embarrassed by a rocket explosion, and Nasa of the U.S..
The lead Sea Launch investor is Boeing Commercial Space Co of the U.S., holding 40 percent, with  RSC-Energia of Russia taking a 25 percent slice, Norway's Kvaerner with 20 percent and  NPO-Yuzhnoye of the Ukraine holding 15 percent.
At a sneak preview in Norway on Thursday, Svein Johnsen, Sea Launch project manager from Kvaerner joked with Russian reporters that countries which had once built technology with the conflict in mind, were now united in their quest for profit.
""In the name of detente,"" he said.
Norway's Kvaerner is the prime contractor, building the mobile sea-borne rocket launch platform and the command ship.
It rescued the Ocean Odyssey oil rig which exploded in a fireball just after the 1988 Piper Alpha rig disaster.
Odyssey has since been stripped and reconstructed to become the floating rocket launcher which will operate under remote control from a specially built command ship.
The platform is nearing completion at Stavanger in Norway, with the command ship under construction and ready for launch next month at Govan in Scotland.
The first rocket launch will happen in June 1998. The rig and command ship will travel from the base in Long Island, California and travel to a site in the Pacific Ocean for blast off.
Satellites and rockets will be assembled on the ship for transfer to the platform which will be evacuated before lift-off.
The command ship will press the control button for firing the rocket at a distance of two or three miles. The 10,600 ton ship has the added protection of blast-proof safety glass at a cost of 2,000 pounds a pane.
The Russians will provide the Zenit rockets, chosen because they can be assembled horizontally on board the command ship.
Boeing will provide project management, marketing services and run the operation for lift-off.
Asked about the risk of explosion Johnsen says ""The risk of explosion is very much related to this business. But we think that risk is very low. There are in-built safety features and it's a very sound operation from an insurance point of view.""
Ignition to release of the rocket takes 4.6 seconds, with emissions from the rocket on take-off channelled sideways.
""If the emissions didn't go sideways, the pressure could shift the platform,"" he said, which weighs 23,000 tons.
Confidence in the system, a world-first, has been demonstrated by a rash of early contracts.
Hughes Space and Communications International Inc of Los Angeles, California has 10 launches signed. Space Systems/Lorel, also from California has five booked.
The groups involved have refused to comment on how much they will charge per launch or on potential profits, with Kvaerner's Johnson only stating that its slice will be ""A good return on our investment.""
It will be able to fire six to eight rockets a year. The idea was originally conceived by Boeing which had intended to fire satellites from a supertanker.
But the danger involved made the platform idea more appealing, allowing evacuation before blast off. ($ = 0.600 British Pounds)

8,"Environmental warfare has broken out across the British construction industry, striking some of the biggest corporations as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- in their profit margins.
Described by one British company as ""eco-terrorism,"" it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s.
Famous names like Tarmac Plc, Costain Group Plc and ARC, a unit of the conglomerate Hanson Plc, have all been targeted.
Activist groups are no longer seen by British companies as harmless, badly organised groups of students and hippies.
""You only have to see them in action at protests,"" said David Harding, a spokesman for ARC, a unit of Hanson which supplies construction materials.
""They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment, they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation.""
One road protester, using the code name Steady Eddie, told the construction journal Building earlier this year: ""If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare, we will aim to drive them out of business.""
In addition to financial threats, companies say that ""terror"" tactics are used by the activists.
Costain's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass, which runs through a conservation area, has led to violent protests delaying building. There have also been bomb threats, staff intimidation and picketing of Chief Executive Alan Lovell's home.
A Costain spokesman told Reuters: ""We've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive's house. But it's when it gets to the (employee) families -- that it goes across the line.""
Tactics used by some underground groups, including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves, which distributes leaflets with instructions on homemade explosives, are now the subject of a police investigation.
Larger activist groups include Earth First, The Land is Ours, Alarm UK and Road Alert.
The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 highway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire.
But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road-building programme and stopping out-of-town superstores, which they say create more traffic and pollution and damage local communities.
The government has slashed its road-building spending, but it has been seen primarily as economic rather than environmental, although protests may have contributed to the decision.
Graham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, said, ""I don't think many firms involved in tendering (bidding) for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project.
""But they are more alert than they were three-four years ago. There's no doubt it's a big issue now.""
He says the damage comes in two forms: ""Tangible -- in the form of extra costs, additional security, threats to staff and the more intangible -- damage caused by negative publicity.""
Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract.
""I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss.""
ARC says it's not just contractors in the front line that are affected but also suppliers like itself.
Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass.
""It was called the 'First Battle of the Newbury bypass',"" said ARC's Harding.
""We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site. Hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) of damage was done in one day. Plus, there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future.""
Simon Brown, analyst at investment bank UBS, said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk.
""When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link (through Twyford Down) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis.""
Harding says others have done the same. ""As a result of eco-terrorism, we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security.""
For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins, overcapacity and stagnant demand, eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector's tale of woe.

8,"Britain's biggest builder Taylor Woodrow has finally got something to celebrate in 1996, its 75th anniversary year, reversing 1995's share slide to outpace the market and assuring investors that year results remain on track.
Colin Parsons, Taylor's chairman, told Reuters in an interview that the second half performance so far has been ""exactly as we indicated in the half year statement,"" when he described the outlook as ""encouraging.""
Taylor's shares hit a high of 183 pence in September after those results, with profits up 81 percent at 25.4 million pounds ($42.37 million).
The shares have since edged off that five-year peak to 156 pence, but are still outperforming the Financial Times All Share index by 30 percent and the building and construction sector by 18 percent, according to Reuters Securities 3000 data.
The group has clawed its way back from a share price nadir of 53 pence in July 1991, in the depths of the building recession when the group's results slumped to a 66 million pounds loss.
Taylor Woodrow is probably most famous for its international contracting activities, with involvement in high-profile projects from the Channel Tunnel to the building of a light railway in Malaysia.
But contracting offers the lowest growth potential in future. Instead revenue growth will stem from housing and land development, property and the Greenham Trading unit in that order, with contracting lagging last.
Commenting on current trading,, Parsons said contracting remained very tough, citing in particular the expense of operating in the British Private Finance Initiative (PFI) market - aiming to get private money into public infrastructure projects.
""PFI remains a very expensive business - too expensive for an industry operating on a zero percent margin basis,"" he said.
The industry has often complained about the high bidding costs - sometimes running to millions of pounds and delays from red-tape adding to costs further. Parsons also says ""It's not a question of allocating capital but whether we want to carry the risks associated with it.""
Parsons says that does not mean Taylor Woodrow will bail out, but it will be selective. He adds that ""overseas business is encouraging,"" however, offering higher-margin business.
Taylor Woodrow remains committed to its four-business strategy, with Parsons comparing it to ""sitting on a chair instead of relying on the uncomfortable shooting stick of having one business. When the wind blows you know where you are on a chair.""
He has refuted suggestions that it may bail out of constracting. But admits that money for acquisitions will be targeted at the other businesses.
Commenting on trading since the first half, Parsons said the UK housing market recovery ""...has now spread into the new home market and is doing well in the second half. The first half was much slower.""
""In Canada housing had a dreadful year in the worst market for 40 years, I believe.""
""Australia seems to be one of the worst markets in living memory. It shows no improvement but it's happening at the same time as a relatively strong Australian economy.
He added ""It will be well into next year before we see any improvement."" The California and Florida markets were reported to be doing well, however.
The outlook for the group's results have brightened, with analysts' forecasts for pretax profits in the year ending 31 December 1996 seen at between 63 and 67 million, a rise of 41 percent on 1995 figures. For the year ending 1997, the forecasts range from 70 to 80 million, a rise of 16 percent.
Simon Brown, analyst at UBS said Taylor's performance turnaround was partly down to ""swift and aggressive action to downsize contracting activities"" into a single operation spanning Africa, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Europe.
""It's closed non-profit making areas and is now investing in areas where it can get a good return,"" he said. The residual contracting business remained a sound business.
UBS has the shares on hold. ""It will move ahead but it will not outperform sharply,"" he said. ($1=.5994 Pound)

8,"Debt-laden Eurotunnel is awaiting the outcome of insurer investigations into the costs of the major fire aboard a freight train last week.
Lead insurer Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP) said on Tuesday it was ""impossible to quantify yet the cost of the damage.""
""Up to now, there is no reliable estimate of the amount of damage caused by the fire on November 18 in the south tunnel,"" it said, adding its maximum residual risk was 75 million francs ($14.4 million).
Eurotunnel said in a statement earlier that it will hold a press conference to update the situation on Wednesday.
The beleaguered tunnel operator also said the investigating judge had finished his inspection of the scene of the blaze, but insurers and company engineers were continuing to investigate.
The latest statements were made amid rife speculation on the cost of the fire, including unconfirmed reports of total insured costs of as much as 200 million pounds ($334 million).
Current restrictions caused by fire damage are costing the group a million pounds in lost revenue every day.
Eurotunnel was also hit this week by reports of possible claims from companies operating the Eurostar high-speed train service which runs through the tunnel.
Eurostar's British owners, the London and Continental Railways consortium, said there were provisions in its contract with Eurotunnel for reduced access charges if the tunnel was partially or fully closed.
Eurotunnel's spokeswoman said reduced access meant Eurostar (and possibly its French and Belgian counterparts) could see ""a reduction to their payment.""
She reiterated that Eurotunnel is fully insured.
""The insurance should cover loss of business, the rolling stock, damage to the tunnel, compensation,"" she said.
The company declined to comment further at this stage.
One source close to Eurotunnel said last week that the cost of fire damage alone to freight and to the tunnel could run to tens of millions of pounds.
""The cost will be millions (of pounds) and could get into double figures, if you consider the damage to the 15 wagons and a locomotive, plus severe tunnel damage,"" said the source.
The cost of replacing a whole train was estimated at around 25 million pounds.
A senior source close to Eurotunnel insurers told Reuters on Tuesday that the cost of replacing rolling stock could be ""in the range of mid- to late-teens (of millions of pounds).""
Adding to uncertainty surrounding insurance cover was the possibility that any payout could be affected by suggestions that the train was on fire before entering the tunnel.
However, analysts seem confident the costs would be covered.
But some said the level of losses caused by the fire were belittled by the scale of Eurotunnel's total debts.
""In relation to Eurotunnel's other financial problem of 8.8 billion (pounds) in debt anything else is incidental, even if the fire cost is 200 million at worst,"" one analyst said.
Since the fire, Eurotunnel's shares have fallen from a close of 91-1/2 pence on November 18 before the fire broke out to 77-1/2 by the close on Tuesday. ($1=5.190 French Franc) ($1=.5990 Pound)

8,"Eurotunnel Plc, the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator, said on Tuesday that its traffic will be cut to one third of normal levels after a fire swept through one of its main tunnels on Monday night, injuring eight people.
Services have been terminated until the tunnel affected is cleared. A Eurotunnel spokesman in London said there was no fixed time for when services would resume or how long reduced capacity will operate once the tunnel is opened.
News of the fire and worries about the extent of damage and a resultant safety review hit Eurotunnel's shares in both London and Paris.
The fire is the latest issue to dog Eurotunnel's performance which has been plagued by negotiations to rejig nine billion pounds ($15 billion) in debt.
In London, Eurotunnel shares fell 3-1/2 pence to 88 pence while in Paris the stock was down around two percent at 7.68 francs per share. But trading in its debt was barely changed.
Commenting on the initial impact on traffic, a Eurotunnel spokesman in London said, ""We will operate at one third of normal capacity and we will give priority to Eurostar (passenger) trains. But there will still be space for shuttle trains as well.""
He did not say how many Eurostar or Le Shuttle trains would be cancelled as a result.
The Tunnel's operations were closed after a fire engulfed part of one of two tunnels, near to Calais where parties from France and Britain had been holding a safety conference.
The Eurotunnel spokesman said it did not yet know the full extent of damage to rolling stock or the tunnel itself or how much it could cost, but admitted it was a ""very ferocious fire.""
""It's quite messy down there. There will be damage to the overhead powerline cables, the heat will have buckled the steel rails and the carriages involved would be very badly damaged and may need to be replaced,"" he said.
The cost of a new train is 25 million pounds, but Eurotunnel did not think an entire train would need replacing. But Eurotunnel faces costs in repairing tunnel and rolling stock damage and may face compensation costs, possibly involving paying for customers to travel by ferry or air.
The company said at this stage that it does not know the cause of the fire. But unconfirmed media reports say the fire began in a truck carrying inflammable polystyrene.
The heavy goods vehicle shuttles are known to have partially open sides -- the safety of which had been questioned by the British fire brigade some years before.
Mike Frattini, fire officer and spokesman for the Kent Fire Brigade which helped put out the tunnel fire, said earlier: ""Our chief officer warned the safety committee (for the tunnel) five years ago.""
Fire fighters could raise this objection again as part of the investigation which will go to the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel Safety Authority.
If the current goods carriages are deemed to be hazardous in light of the accident there could be a call for changes, incurring further costs to Eurotunnel.
Eurotunnel's spokesman refused to comment on whether changes will need to be made to carriages, adding that ""It is a key question.""
The fire comes just before Christmas when the tunnel was expected to see a surge in holiday sales. But pre-holiday publicity now consists of media reports of choking people emerging from smoke and ""blow-torch""-like heat.
Asked whether this would dampen customer demand, Eurotunnel said ""We hope not. But what's happened has happened and how the fire was handled should renew confidence in our safety procedures,"" said the press officer.
One analyst at Natwest Securities said there should be little further impact on shares or consumer confidence.
Shares in cross-channel ferry operator P&amp;O were five pence higher at 602-1/2p.

8,"Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, fresh from its demerger from Hanson Plc in October, said on Monday it was capable of cutting back debt levels and investing in further export growth as a dual policy.
Gareth Davis, chief executive, told Reuters in an interview that the two could be achieved ""in parallel"" because of the group's strong cash generation.
In particular, Davis said Imperial was in talks with a Japanese company about entering the Japanese market for the first time. He also said the group would keep open the option of a share buyback in the future.
Imperial inherited around 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of debt as its legacy from the Hanson family break-up. But Davis said this did not hamper the group's plans to seek distribution deals or joint ventures in the overseas cigarette markets and possibly examine small acquisition deals in the fragmented cigar market.
He added that, if an important larger-sized acquisition opportunity arose, he would be prepared to raise debt levels, but for the moment ""the priority is to get it down. Our situation, our ability to generate cash means we can do things in parallel - pay down debt and pay for acquisitions...Bolt-on acquisitions are more likely in the cigar area"", he added.
On the Japanese market in particular, Davis told Reuters ""We are looking to do something in Japan. We are actively considering this. In one way or another we will establish a presence in that market,"" admitting that talks were under way with one party.
But he sought to reassure shareholders that Imperial would not squander its sound financial inheritance in its bid to catch up in the overseas field. ""In our international expansion plans I would not dream of being a balance sheet wrecker,"" he said. If Imperial failed to find the right deals, it would be prepared to conside other options to return value, he said.
If a possible acquisition fails to offer sufficient rates of return ""we would say: what would a share buyback do to enhance shareholder value, rather than a potential acquisition?""
""A buyback is something we'd never rule out. Given our cash flow characteristics people tend to say ""What are you going to do with all that cash.'""
Imperial reports its first set of results since the Hanson demerger on December 5 when it will give a trading update of the first few months since its split.
Davis said he expected the British market to continue to decline at around two percent next year.
But the international business, accounting for 17 percent of profits in the first eight months of the year, is expected to show continued rapid growth.
""I would be very disappointed if it wasn't 25 percent by 2000."" The last two years have seen overseas sales double, but Davis drew the line at hitting his target by 1997.
""That would be overstating it (our confidence). But the signs are the business is showing strong growth.""
Despite his caution, Davis has said that the company has already clinched a deal with unions to add a third shift from May 1997 which has the potential to raise capacity at its Nottingham factory  by one third.
Imperial says if a number of overseas deals start feeding through it will be ready to meet the surge in demand.
The third shift could, in theory, raise Imperial's total cigarette production to 53 billion from the existing 37 billion mark. ($1=.6069 Pound)

8,"British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group on Friday clinched a British rail franchise and said it planned to spend an extra 250 million pounds ($420 million) on new trains and increased services.
He won control of the CrossCountry serice, which covers more than 130 stations and is based in the central British city of Birmingham.
The company, which has 842 staff and earned passenger revenues worth 108 million pounds ($181.3 million) in the year to March, is part of the national rail network that is in the process of being privatised.
""Virgin believes that it can be built into one of the prime rail franchises serving several markets...Exciting times are ahead,"" Branson told a London news briefing.
Will Whitehorn, director of Virgin Rail, told Reuters: ""Our key plan is to buy a new fleet, spending 250 million pounds on new rolling stock, agreed as part of the bid.""
The order will be placed next year, with the first deliveries due in 2002. Under financial terms, the government subsidy in the first year of the 15 year franchise will be 112.9 million pounds.
The 112.9 million subsidy has been cut from the 1996/97 level of 127 million pounds and will average at 36.4 million over the life of the franchise term.
Whitehorn said the subsidy will be eroded over the 15 year term and in the final year Virgin Rail will make a 10 million pound payment to the government.
Sir George Young, transport secretary said: ""This deal is final proof of the renaissance which is sweeping through Britain's railway industry...Virgin will take a loss-making nationalised company and transform it within 15 years into a profitable enterprise.""
Virgin will refurbish the company's HST 125 diesel trains and has pledged to increase train miles by 14 percent between May 1998 and 2002.
The services will be rebranded under the Virgin name and cover destinations across England, Scotland and Wales.
This is the first rail franchise to be awarded to Virgin Rail which also bid unsuccessfully for the Gatwick Express route.
But Virgin is on the shortlist for the West Coast rail franchise and has a bid in for the Thameslink service in London.
Of 25 rail franchises covering passenger services across Britain, the government has sold 14 to the private sector as part of its privatisation of the network.
The Virgin empire, which spans everything from its airline, music and financial services to its own-label cola, already has a major rail business.
It is a partner in the London and Continental Railways (LCR) consortium which owns the Eurostar passenger service that links London with Paris and Brussels through the Channel Tunnel.
A serious fire in the tunnel last week has temporarily halted services, but Whitehorn declined to comment on the financial impact on the company.
LCR has said that it needs to raise Eurostar's passenger traffic to fund construction of the planned Channel Tunnel Rail Link between London and the tunnel. ($1=.5956 Pound)

8,"Drugs giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc bought the remaining 50 percent of its Japanese joint venture Nippon Glaxo for 354 million pounds ($596 million) on Thursday in its quest for growth in the world's second biggest market.
Analysts in London said they had long expected the buy-out of Japanese partner Shin Nihon Jitsugyo Co Ltd, which will also get a 7.7 million pounds (1.38 billion) payout in lieu of the 1996 dividend.
Nippon Glaxo develops, produces and markets prescription medicines across Japan and has net assets of 30.7 billion yen ($275.3 million), as valued on June 30. Its post-tax profit for the six months to June 30 was 2.5 billion yen.
After setting up a series of Japanese joint ventures since the early 1980s, Glaxo has moved to take them over in a bid to carve a share in Japan's lucrative marketplace, second only to the U.S. in terms of profitability and sales to the group.
Seven percent of Glaxo Wellcome's profits stem from Japan, which represents 20 percent of the world market itself.
One London-based pharmaceuticals analyst said: ""The deal will be slightly earnings enhancing as it's financed by debt and Japanese interest rates are low at half a percent.""
The move to take over ventures in Japan would allow the group to accelerate growth plans by launching new products there, including its new respiratory treatments for asthma and the new herpes treatment Valtrex which replaces Zovirax.
Another analyst agreed that Japan offered a notable expansion opportunity, saying: ""It's obviously one of the leading growth markets for Glaxo.""
But shares in Glaxo showed little response, falling a modest 3.5 pence to 950 in London.
Under the deal, Hiroshi Konishi, president of Nippon Glaxo, and Akira Konishi, vice-president and general manager, will give up these positions but remain members of Nippon Glaxo's board, Glaxo Wellcome said.
Nippon Glaxo had net assets at June 30 of 30.7 billion yen, or 180 million pounds. Its profits after tax for the six months ended June 30 were 2.5 billion yen.

8,"Imperial Tobacco Plc, fresh from its split from Hanson Plc, has admitted that its former parent group did receive a takeover approach prior to the demerger but rejected it because the price was too low.
Imperial's chief executive Gareth Davis told Reuters in an interview this week: ""A phone call was made to Grosvenor Place (Hanson's headquarters) but they were talking silly prices."" He confirmed that the interested party was a tobacco firm, but refused to comment on recent speculation that B.A.T. Industries Plc was a potential buyer.

2,"Former Barings executive Ron Baker plans to bring a counter-claim in a lawsuit against him by Dutch bank ING Barings for repayment of a loan he is alleged to have received, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday.
""He (Baker) plans to bring in his own counter-claim into those proceedings and they will be heard together unless some sort of arrangement is reached beforehand,"" Lindsay Hill, a partner at London law firm Fox Williams said.
ING Barings last month confirmed it was suing Baker for 113,000 pounds ($185,800), representing a 100,000 pound loan allegedly given to Baker when he was at Barings, plus interest.
British merchant bank Barings collapsed in February 1995 amid losses of around $1.4 billion run up by the unauthorised derivatives trades of Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson. It was rescued by ING which formed ING Barings as its investment banking arm.
Leeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore for his part in the bank's downfall.
But the saga looks set to run on for some time, with writs filed by administrators of the bank against the former auditors and subsequent third party proceedings being issued against former bosses, including Baker.
Hill said Baker would contest the ING Barings case against him and his counter-claim would be for an unpaid bonus.
""He believes that the monies that he was promised by way of bonus remain due and are outstanding so yes, they will come into the equation in terms of resolving the dispute with ING Barings,"" Hill said.
Baker would not be the first to attempt to force ING Barings to pay a bonus which had apparently been promised before the collapse of Barings itself and ING's takeover.
But Hill said the decision by a London industrial tribunal on Thursday to reject a claim by another former Barings executive for an allegedly unpaid bonus had no implications for Baker's case.
""It's a different case, it's for different sums of money and the circumstances are not the same,"" Hill said.
Mary Walz, who was global head of equity financial products at Barings Investment Bank, had her 500,000 pound claim, which she said she was told was ""set in stone"" by her former Barings bosses, thrown out by the tribunal.
Hill declined to say how much Baker's counter-claim would be for but said the sum was ""substantial"".

2,"Financial services and property group Liberty International vowed on Thursday to change the way the British pensions market works with the launch of a new user-friendly subsidiary.
""The market is poised for change, requiring a fresh approach, and our company will provide this by demystifying pensions for everybody - both individuals and the companies for which they work,"" Liberty chairman Donald Gordon said.
Liberty has set up its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, and will target retail pensions and money purchase pension schemes -- pensions where the benefit is linked to the amount an individual has put in.
Liberty, 69 percent owned by South Africa's Liberty Life, has enrolled the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme, which will pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions.
Liberty's Gordon said the move into the British pensions market was an extension of a worldwide shift from defined benefit -- where an individual's pension is related to his final salary -- to defined contribution principles.
This would have ""a most profound influence on business practice and retirement savings in the future"". In Britain there is also ""an urgent and growing need for quality privatised retirement savings which require a radical change in approach and funding techniques"", Gordon added.
A rapidly ageing population and low birth rate were combining to increase this need, Gordon said.
Liberty also announced it had teamed up with fund management group Hermes to form Hermes Liberty International Pensions. This will offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager.
BT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture ""critical mass from the outset"" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Gordon said.
He said Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help the group to provide quality and competitively priced pension services. Hermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds.
""Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that's a very good marriage,"" Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said.
""It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us.""
He said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.
As well as selling pensions directly by telephone, Liberty also plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said. ($1=.6395 Pound)

2,"Embattled British property company Greycoat had the immediate threat of a shareholder call for its break-up removed on Thursday, but the firm still faced an unwanted merger proposal from a smaller rival.
Greycoat welcomed an overwhelming vote against the breakup resolution put forward by the UK Active Value Fund (UKAV) and chief executive Peter Thornton said he hoped the group could now get on with its normal business.
""It has cost us a lot of money and a lot of wasted effort and time. What we would like to do is get on with running a property company,"" Thornton said in an interview.
He was speaking after the vote by Greycoat shareholders on UKAV's call for the sale of all Greycoat's 500 million pound ($811.6 million) assets. Among Greycoat sharholders, 95 percent of those who voted, representing 55 percent of the share capital, voted against the sale.
Shares in Greycoat closed unchanged at 163.5 pence, compared with a year high of 168 pence and a low of 130 pence.
UKAV, which is advised by South African Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers, said on Wednesday it would abstain at the reconvened extraordinary general meeting.
It argued it had already achieved one of its main aims, the sale of Greycoat's largest asset, Embankment Place, on the River Thames in central London.
It now thought a merger proposal from Moorfield Estates had ""considerable merit and could better serve the interests of Greycoat shareholders"".
Thornton welcomed the fact that one uncertain element surrrounding the group was over, adding Greycoat had yet to receive the answers needed about the Moorfield merger proposal.
""We still haven't received answers to our 30-odd questions,"" he said of the Moorfield approach, adding Greycoat was not prepared to embark on a due diligence exercise or open its books to Moorfield without more concrete details of the firm's plans.
Moorfield has suggested demerging Greycoat's largest assets, but Thornton said it had yet to convince him it had proposals that would work.
Moorfield shares were also unchanged at 30.5 pence, compared with a year high of 34 pence and a low of 24 pence.
Thornton said relations with potential purchasers had been established but there were fairly few buyers in the world able to pay more than 200 million pounds ($324.6 million).
But he said he could not quantify how much losing the opportunity of an ""off market"" sale might shave off the sale price. ($1=.6161 Pound)

2,"British property group MEPC said on Thursday it was pleased with a rise in pretax profits for the year but admitted disappointment at a fall in its net asset value (NAV) to 450 pence per share from 457 pence.
""We feel very confident about the whole of the profit statement. The only slight disappointment is on the NAV side,"" James Tuckey, MEPC's chief executive, said in an interview.
Earlier MEPC announced a 14 percent increase in pretax profit for the year to 140 million stg from 122.6 million stg. Earnings per share rose nine percent to 22.9 pence.  
Tuckey said the NAV fall reflected a marginal fall in values both in Britain and elsewhere but said the NAV drop was less than the relevant indices.
""We feel that the performance of our UK portfolio, which accounts for 70 percent of the group, is indeed where we would have expected it to be,"" he added.
He pointed out the valuation date was August 31 and there had been activity and evidence of an improvement in the market since then. ""If we redid the valuation for December 1, we would probably get a different answer,"" he said.  
Tuckey said the other factor which had brought the NAV down was a significant 31 million stg write-down on the valuation of MEPC's Northridge Mall in Los Angeles. This had been equivalent to 7.5 pence per share.
""We are convinced this is a temporary write-down because the centre is still getting back on its feet after the earthquake some three years ago. We are quite confident we will get that value back in the next two to three years as the centre re-establishes itself,"" Tuckey said.
""We felt that we wanted to share as much information as we could with shareholders,"" he added.  
MEPC's decision to give a target NAV of 690 pence per share for 2001 reflected its repositioning of its portfolio.
""We're sticking our necks out...The portfolio is very very different to what it was three years ago and what we're trying to do is give shareholders some feel of where we think the performance is going to be in five years time,"" Tuckey said.
""We believe we need to share with our stakeholders what it is we are trying to achieve.""
Tuckey said the full impact of the change of strategy in MEPC's portfolio would take time but there would be progress towards the firm's targets each year.  
He said there was a much firmer tone to the markets, particularly in the UK over the last few months. Apart from Northridge, the rest of the U.S. portfolio had performed ""extremely well"".
MEPC plans to keep the lion's share of its portfolio in the UK, with the remainder in the U.S. and Australia. It has wound down its European portfolio and has no plans to go back into continental Europe in the immediate future.
Tuckey said the group was keen to make acquisitions, with the proceeds of its European disposals, but that there was a shortage of good stock available, particularly in the UK.  
While MEPC has resolved to increase the dividend paid to shareholders, Tuckey said he could not predict when it would be increased although he pointed out that dividend cover had improved to 1.15 times from 1.05 a year before.
""It depends on the forward look, on how the markets are feeling,"" he said. The market was competitive and good stock was hard to find but Tuckey said he welcomed the prospect of changes to the way the market functioned with more liquidity likely.
""I think there are changes afoot and they are changes for the good because what they will allow is greater liquidity for the sector, possibly through derivatives or the property investment trusts that have been talked about,"" he said, adding that MEPC would be involved in any such developments.

2,"Shares in Cable &amp; Wireless (C&amp;W) advanced on Tuesday after investors welcomed news of a deal with NYNEX of the United States and Bell Canada International to create Britain's largest cable operator.
""This was a bold strategic stroke by the (C&amp;W) chief executive,"" said Chris McFadden, analyst at Merrill Lynch.
The deal, which took only five weeks to complete, brings together C&amp;W's Mercury, British cable company Videotron, Bell Cablemedia and NYNEX CableComms, eclipsing Telewest as Britain's biggest cable operator.
It sent C&amp;W shares soaring, peaking at 476.5 pence before easing back to close up 25.5 at 466.5 pence.
The move is a landmark deal for C&amp;W chief executive Richard Brown, appointed five months ago, and follows the collapse of merger talks earlier this year between C&amp;W and its great rival British Telecommunications Plc.
""The logic is irrefutable...the advantages of scope and size are undoubtedly there,"" said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst John Tysoe.
BT said it welcomed the consolidation in the sector and analysts said the move could strengthen the telecoms giant's calls for it to be allowed to provide cable television.
But BT's shares edged lower to close down 4.5 at 353.5 pence and analysts said the new company would give BT a run for its money.
""We had a common vision of what could be done and we have done it with speed and nimbleness,"" Brown told Reuters. C&amp;W last month replaced BT in a major German alliance with diversified utility RWE that is seen as the main competitor to Deutsche Telekom's dominance as the German market is liberalised.
The new merged company, which will provide integrated telecommunications, information and entertainment services, will give C&amp;W's telephone company Mercury access to 18 million business and domestic customers, Brown said.
The number of homes within its sights will eclipse former market leader Telewest's two million at 2.47 million but it will not be in direct competition as the companies operate in different franchises.
Telewest's shares were boosted by the news, as analysts re-evaluated the potential in the sector, gaining 12.5 pence to close at 135.5 pence.
""This is clear evidence of confidence in the future of the U.K. cable industry,"" a spokesman for industry body the Cable Communications Association, said.
Around six billion pounds ($7.5 billion) has already been invested in laying out cable networks and a further six billion pounds of investment is planned, the spokesman added.
In a related deal, Videotron is being bought by Bell Cablemedia in a complex transaction involving a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia by Cable &amp; Wireless. This values Videotron at around $1.09 billion.
Once the merger and Videotron deal have been completed, Cable &amp; Wireless will own 52.6 percent of the new company -- to be called Cable &amp; Wireless Communications -- with NYNEX owning 18.5 percent and Bell Canada 14.2 percent.
The remaining 15 percent will be floated, which analysts said would give it some scarcity value, with listings planned in both London and New York, probably in about six months.
C&amp;W's Brown said he could not detail the financial aspects of the merger because of the new company's planned listing.
McFadden said cost savings should be quite significant, including tax offsets, refinancing of high-yield cable television funding and possibly through staff cuts, along with eliminating duplication in laying cables.
The new group aims to increase revenues by providing a wider range of services to existing customers, offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access.
It could also secure more favourable terms for programming from BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake.
BSkyB shares ended down 18 pence at 678.5 pence. ($1=.7986 Pound)

2,"Final approval for Lloyd's of London's recovery plan edged closer Wednesday as it declared that over 90 percent of members had accepted a settlement offer aimed at securing the 300-year-old insurance market's future.
Lloyd's said it had been swamped by U.S. investors signing up for its recovery plan after a U.S. appeals court overturned a ruling that had threatened the insurance market's survival. By Wednesday afternoon, 66.7 percent of U.S. members had accepted.
""The level of acceptances speaks for itself. Members have made their views toward the reconstruction of Lloyd's abundantly clear,"" Lloyd's Chairman David Rowland said in a statement.
Earlier, a Lloyd's spokesman said acceptances from U.S. investors in the market, known as Names, had flooded in overnight.
Almost half of the 2,700 U.S. Names had until Tuesday night held off, with only 53 percent accepting by then.
This followed a decision by a federal appeals court in Baltimore Tuesday to overturn U.S. District Court Judge Robert Payne's ruling in Richmond, Va., Friday to allow U.S. Names more time to consider the plan.
Payne granted an injunction giving U.S. Names more time to consider the plan and ordered Lloyd's to provide further information by Sept. 23. On Tuesday, the panel of judges in Baltimore sent the case back to the lower court with orders to dismiss it.
Rowland said he acknowledged that many overseas members had deferred their acceptance in the light of the Virginia court judgment and the subsequent Baltimore ruling.
Over the last few days, evidence of support for the Lloyd's proposals among its 34,000 investors worldwide has grown. On Tuesday evening, acceptances totalled 82 percent, compared with 75 percent Saturday.
Wednesday's noon deadline for accepting the 3.2 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) recovery plan, under which Lloyd's proposes that Names pay to help reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas, was extended to give all a chance to respond.
Rowland said Wednesday afternoon that under the circumstances it was ""fair and proper"" to exercise flexibility in pushing back the deadline for acceptances.
Lloyd's said that any formal, longer-term extension would be subject to a decision by its council at a Thursday meeting at which it would consider ""the prospect of declaring the settlement offer acceptances unconditional.""
This extension will give the market enough time to collect the convincing majority of acceptances, especially from U.S. Names, which it needs to prove its own solvency.
Lloyd's problems began in the 1980s when a destructive combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds.
Long-standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses.
The market is due to submit figures to Britain's Department of Trade and Industry next week in an annual solvency test, and file with the U.S. Treasury and New York Insurance Department later next month.
Equitas may lift off in two weeks if all goes as planned. The recovery plan's success increasingly looks likely, but another challenge by U.S. Names has not been ruled out.
However, U.S. legal sources said overnight that while U.S. investors could in theory attempt to challenge Tuesday's order, it would be difficult to do so successfully.
Despite that, one U.S. Name, Kenneth Chiate, who is chief negotiator for a group known as the American Names Association, said he expected U.S. Names to appeal the Baltimore ruling.

2,"Mention moneylending to most Britons and their instant reaction is ""you mean loan-sharks!"".
But Britain's established credit companies, which lend to people unable to borrow from the high street banks or credit card companies, say the public image of menacing debt collectors is a far cry from how they conduct their regulated business.
""We are credit collectors. A debt collector is someone who has no relationship with the customer. It's a totally different process,"" says Eddie Cran, chief executive of the financial services group Cattle's, which runs door-to-door moneylenders Shopacheck.
Such firms are tied closely to the wheeling and dealing of the City of London. Provident Financial, Cattle's and London Scottish Bank are all publicly quoted, profitable firms paying shareholders annual dividends.
People who borrow from them may have had minor civil court judgements against them, be unemployed or simply not want to have bank accounts or credit cards. The firms provide a service others -- except for unregulated outfits -- will not, and while it won't cost a pound of flesh, it is not cheap.
To those used to credit cards or in-store credit the rates may appear outrageously high. But credit companies point out they include major costs such as collection and insurance, are agreed in advance and do not rise if a payment is missed.
So while interest rates may be at all-time lows, these service charges mean the APRs (annualised percentage rate) can exceed 150 percent. To borrow 100 pounds ($167) over 25 weeks from Shopacheck with a five pound weekly repayment costs 25 pounds.
Shopacheck, which started in the 1930s in northeast England, has 2,800 agents. Its average loan is for six months, the average amount 150 pounds and average indebtedness 350 pounds.
STREET COLLECTING
Only a few miles from the City, but a million miles from its hefty salaries and bonuses, Kathy, a self-employed agent for Shopacheck, does her weekly door-to-door collection of debt repayments through the streets of northwest London.
The terraced suburban houses at which she stops are remarkably average. Most have front gardens, some are neatly laid out with blooming rose bushes while others are less well-kept, with tatty patches of litter-strewn grass.
Inside there are the usual consumer trappings of late 1990s British life.
Televisions, video-recorders, washing machines and microwave ovens, even the odd fish tank, are all in evidence, especially when crammed into a small council flat along with children, their toys, pets and piles of ironing.
At each house Kathy, a 37-year-old mother of three, collects sums ranging from two pounds fifty to 20 pounds.
Some customers take loans in the form of vouchers which can be spent only at certain high street shops, while others use the retail service offered by Shopacheck and buy items such as bed linen, beds or barbeques from the firm's own catalogue.
Most of her clients seem to welcome her as a friend, they expect her visits and have the money ready to hand to her. Kathy says that, after eight years, she is a treated as a long-standing family friend or agony aunt by many of them.
Only at one home does the son of the house come to the door and tell Kathy that his mother isn't in. ""Fine, can you tell her I'll see her as usual next week,"" says Kathy.
But getting money back isn't always this easy.
Kathy admits that if a customer threatens her, she passes the problem back to the company, which says it instructs its self-employed agents not to take personal risks.
MONEYLENDERS PLUG GAP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES
""The one thing about credit is that it is easy to give but much harder to get back,"" says Paul Oliver, a Shopacheck regional manager who has been in the business for 27 years as customer, agent and manager.
He is not alone as a successful businessman who has made use of Britain's long-standing system of moneylending. The managing director of one British bank confided he would not be where he is today had it not been for a money lending firm.
His family could not afford to buy him a suit for an interview. He took a loan, bought the essential attire, got his first job and set himself on the path to greater things.
Oliver says nine out of 10 times business is conducted with the woman of the house and although bad debts are expected, they only reach about four percent a year, which is good going for a business the mainstream lenders won't touch because of the risk.
A recent television documentary showed some moneylenders breaking rules laid down by the Consumer Credit Act. Oliver says he deals harshly with anyone who steps outside the rules.
For Cran firms such as his are plugging a gap in Britain's financial services marketplace and he is keen to correct what he sees as ""untrue perceptions"" about the business. ""What we are actually attempting to do is to deal with customers who cannot get credit through the mainstream lenders,"" Cran told Reuters.
""It (door-to-door lending) is very high cost and very personal. We have to train people to look after a number of customers,"" he added. A customer who fails to pay is only pursued through the courts ""as a very last measure"" and only in ""very extreme circumstances"" is an outside firm called in.
Cran says Cattle's target market is about five-and-a-half million people, around two million of whom need the discipline of an agent calling to collect every week.
But the stigma involved means Cattle's also offers Welcome, a loans service for people who have bank accounts and pay by direct debit. This ""requires a very high rejection rate and an in-depth granting procedure"", Cran says.
SHAREHOLDERS REAP THE DIVIDENDS
For Cattle's and its competitors credit is a lucrative business. In September it reported increased pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year of nearly 15.0 million pounds. In 1995 its shareholders received a total dividend of 6.9 pence.
In August Provident Financial, the sector's biggest player, reported first half pre-tax profits of 47.5 million pounds. It said it had seen continued growth in home collected credit and was confident of a ""good result"" for the year as a whole.
But for customers, things might not be so rosy. While most manage to pay back their loans, some do not. Kathy soon spots trouble. ""You can see they are struggling if they start having to scrabble around for pennies,"" she says. ($1=.5990 Pound)

2,"Britain's Takeover Panel, after battling to defend its policing role of London's busy mergers and acquisitions market against European interference, has ended the year in the spotlight over its handling of CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric.
The non-statutory body has spent much of 1996 campaigning against a framework European Union proposal on takeover bids which it says will lead to multi-million pound lawsuits and harm London's system of takeover regulation.
But on Monday the panel's own role was under scrutiny as the outcome of a bitter bid battle between U.S. group CE and British utility Northern hung in the balance.
""What is going on at the moment is being watched pretty closely. It is a fairly unique situation,"" a financial services lawyer said.
Criticism of the part the panel has played stems from a 250,000 pound ($418,600) payment made by Northern to one of its advisors, BZW, the investment banking arm of British banking giant Barclays Plc.
BZW said this was a discretionary fee and denied that it was linked to its purchase last week of Northern shares, which had already been allowed by the panel. After it was told of the payment, the panel extended the deadline for acceptances.
After the official close of the offer last Friday, Northern would have remained independent as CE had only achieved the support of 49.77 percent of Northern shareholders. But following the extension, CE said on Monday it had 50.13 percent.
A source close to the discussions said it was ""very unusual and maybe unique"" for the panel to be in the position of deciding the fate of a company in this way.
This view was echoed by other market participants.
""This is an unndented step the panel has taken,"" one investment banking source told Reuters of the decision to grant an extension to the offer period at such a late stage.
Northern's fate now lies in the panel's hands. The company has said it wants to appeal against the decision and revert to the result at the original end of the offer period. Acceptances after the initial deadline require the panel's approval.
""They (the panel) now find themselves in a very difficult situation,"" the investment banking source added.
Any changes in the way in which the panel operates must either come from government, by bringing in legislation to establish a statutory force to regulate takeovers, or from within the body itself, market players said.
Pressure from industry participants could lead to the panel making changes itself. ""They can change the ""Blue Book"" (the rule book regulating takeovers) at the drop of a hat,"" one industry source said, adding that it had so far managed the system well.
""The panel seemed to be coping well with the upturn in bid activity. The system seemed to be working pretty well,"" he said. Mergers and acquisitions activity has reached peak levels in recent weeks, with a number of both agreed and disputed bids.
Apart from the potential threat from the European takeover directive, there had ""been no major challenges to the panel's authority over the year"", he added.
Even if the ruling Conservative Party loses a general election which must be held by next May, market participants said they did not expect pressure for legislation to put the panel on a statutory footing under a Labour government.
""The general feeling is pretty much against it (legislation) and the indications so far ist change it,"" said one.

2,"British fund manager Invesco announced its widely-expected merger with U.S. mutual fund company AIM Management Group on Monday, creating one of the world's largest investment management businesses.
The combined group will be called AMVESCO Plc and have around $150 billion under management. The merger values AIM at approximately $1.6 billion, Invesco said..
""We are creating a prototype company for the future,"" Bob McCullough, Invesco's chief financial officer, told Reuters.
But analysts were divided as to the timing of the deal although most were happy to give Invesco the benefit of the doubt as far as its claims on synergy are concerned.
""The deal is exquisitely timed for the AIM shareholders and conversely not so exquisitely for Invesco shareholders,"" said Martin Cross, analyst at UBS.
Cross argues that Invesco is buying at the top of the Wall Street market which many see as having some very stretched valuations. Cross said that UBS strategists are forecasting a 15 percent downward correction on the Dow Jones index next year which, if it came to pass, would leave AIM looking rather expensive.
But Phillip Gibbs at BZW was upbeat about the merger.
""It looks rather cheap, I think they've done rather nicely,"" Gibbs said but did add a rider on the possibility of a major correction in the US equities market.
Analysts said the price paid by Invesco was something short of what had been predicted but Cross said it was a ""pretty full price but what one might expect for a premium company.""
Invesco shares closed unchanged at 237.5p Invesco's chairman and chief executive Charles Brady, the man who will lead the new group, said it would have ""the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry.""
Invesco said it would fund the merger with the issue of 290 million new shares to existing holders of AIM shares. These would be valued at approximately $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the enlarged group and be subject to restrictions on selling the shares.
McCullough said the merger, which is conditional on approval by both Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals, would be non-dilutive and would not have any cost savings built-in. However, there would be cost savings in the future, he said.
The merger is not expected to be completed before February.
McCullough also said the $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt, with a one-for-five rights offering on the cards. This would involve issuing roughly 50 million new shares, he said.
McCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive. ""If you look at it on the basis of funds under management, it (the cost) is less than three percent,"" he said.
""There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,"" he said. This long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management.
The merger presented an enormous number of synergies, with the two companies using different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.
There would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a ""no-load"" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM making its sales through intermediaries.
Both companies were ""really active managers"" and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco's global infrastructure presented a major opportunity.
He denied the heavy exposure to the U.S. would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. ""We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe,"" he said.

2,"Even if British media and leisure group Pearson decides to sell its interest in merchant banking group Lazards, the bank would not be under immediate threat from larger rivals, banking sources said on Monday.
Marjorie Scardino's accession last week as Pearson chief executive has prompted widespread talk that Pearson would sell its 50 percent in Lazard Partners, which owns the three Lazard houses in London, Paris and New York.
But a pre-emption agreement in cross-shareholdings between Lazards and Pearson would ensure the partnership has first refusal on its own shares if Pearson decides to sell its stake, thus preventing the family-run merchant bank from falling into the hands of larger and expanding international rivals.
""This (speculation) is prompted by the fact that Pearson has a new chief executive who will obviously want to review things,"" one senior corporate financier told Reuters, adding that the pre-emption agreement meant Lazards ""either stays with Pearson or comes within the Lazard empire fully"".
Officials at both Pearson and Lazard Brothers in London declined to comment on talk of a possible sale.
Pearson has a 50 percent stake in London's Lazard Brothers and smaller nine percent stakes in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York. Its 50 percent stake in the umbrella group Lazard Partners was negotiated during the 1980s.
Analysts suggest Lazards does not fit into Pearson's main information, education and entertainment divisions and is therefore a target for being spun off. But banking sources point out that Lazards has been a profitable venture and not a drain.
""It (Lazards) has not required any capital or management time (from Pearson),"" the senior financier added.
Pearson, in its 1995 annual report and accounts, points out that its ""close ties to the three Lazard investment banking houses again proved their worth in 1995"".
It highlighted attributable profits of 39.9 million pounds from the group for that year. If Pearson, described by Michel David-Weill -- senior partner of Lazard Freres in Paris -- as a ""great partner"" to Lazards since 1919, decides to sever its ties with the merchant bank, there could also be other complications.
The Lazard group, which has successfully specialised in corporate finance advisory work as well as asset mangagment and trading activities, holds 48 million Pearson shares.
The Financial Times at the weekend quoted David-Weill as saying Lazards might decide to sell this 360 million pound ($600 million) stake to finance a buy-back of Pearson's holding.
The newspaper said David-Weill had said the Lazards holding in Pearson was equivalent in value to Pearson's Lazard stake.
Although Lazards's stake has been seen as obstacle to a takeover attempt against Pearson, it might sell its shares on the market but in discussion with the group and ""not to a party which could be hostile"", David-Weill told the paper.
While Scardino's role at Pearson has been the subject of close scrutiny since her appointment, Lazards have also been in the news, with suggestions of a power-struggle over who will succeed 64-year-old David-Weill.
David-Weill said last week there was no succession crisis at the bank, adding he still had time. Under the bank's statutes, he can remain at the helm for another eight years. ($1=.5974 Pound)

42,"Economic commentators in Hong Kong are sounding alarms about the unbridled optimism spurring stock and property prices to new highs ahead of the British colony's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.
Concerns are mounting that rising price pressures could inflate a collapsible bubble on the assumption that China will support Hong Kong's economy through the transition regardless of any political disruption.
""The term 'moral hazard' refers to the apparently growing belief in local markets that there is little dramatic down-side risk -- as opposed to short-term volatility -- because ultimately China will suppport Hong Kong markets,"" Ian Perkin, chief economist with the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.
In contrast to earlier fears that political uncertainty could torpedo Hong Kong's economy in 1997, domestic confidence in China's determination to keep the economy stable through the transition is so high that an unexpected problem has arisen -- price instability.
Economists are starting to revise upward their inflation forecasts for 1997 in response to booming stock and luxury property prices.
""The outlook for 1997 is going to be less good than we thought,"" said Kevin Chan, economist at Salomon Brothers.
Salomon has raised its 1997 forecast for the territory's benchmark consumer price index to 7 percent from 6.6 percent late last year, and Chan said further increases are possible.
Sudden strength in Hong Kong's stock market in the middle of last year was welcomed as proof of confidence in the colony's future under China, and evidence of an economic turnaround following an export slump early last year and three years of austerity in China.
But the optimism became concern in November when speculation emerged in the luxury end of Hong Kong's property market.
Citing anecdotal evidence, Perkin argued that overseas and domestic investors confident of China's commitment to economic stability in Hong Kong are rushing to buy high-end properties in anticipation of short-term gains.
The Hong Kong government has since strongly supported a set of anti-speculation measures by the Real Estate Developers Association, and warned it will step in if there are signs that speculation is filtering down to the middle or low end of the property market.
But economists said property price volatility would eventually stimulate overall inflation, even though it has been restricted so far to the high end of the market.
""This will not be good for inflation expectations,"" Chan said. ""In general, people will expect the higher prices in the luxury sector to affect medium and small flats.""
Chan estimates an overall rise of 30 percent in property prices will translate into at least a 15 percent increase in rents this year, which account for 25 percent of the Hong Kong government's benchmark consumer price index.
Food prices, which account for 37 percent of the index, are expected to rise by at least 8 percent this year after holding steady last year.
Hong Kong will also suffer from its currency link to the U.S. dollar. If the United States raises short-term interest rates this year by one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point, as many expect, real rates in Hong Kong -- the difference between nominal rates and inflation -- will fall to about 1 percent, Chan said.
Such low rates will propel growing momentum in both private consumption and retail sales.
China, with its well-documented aversion to the socially destabilising effects of inflation, has done little to stoke further exuberance over Hong Kong's post-1997 economy beyond saying it backed Hong Kong's currency link.
""There seems little doubt Hong Kong's new sovereign wants to see the local economy prosper throughout the year of transition and in the early years of its resumption of sovereignty,"" Perkin wrote. ""It (is) probably true that it does not want to see the local economy going on a speculative spree that will eventually run out of steam and cause a collapse.""
"
42,"Hong Kong experts helping Beijing establish its funds industry said Chinese planners wanted to use domestic savings to build capital markets rather than offer lucrative opportunities to foreigners.
""I do get the sense they are more keen to mobilise their own domestic savings,"" said Andrew Lo, chairman of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association on Monday.
Lo had just returned from Beijing where he met Vice-Premier Zhu Rhongji who told him China would release a set of rules and regulations governing a domestic funds industry by the end of the year.
Lo said he also received firm confirmation from Zhu that Hong Kong's position as a strong financial centre will continue following the territory's handover to Chinese rule next year.
""And while China will continue to develop its capital markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen they see this very much as complementary to Hong Kong rather than as competition,"" Lo said.
He said he was convinced that China appreciates the importance of an active funds management industry in the development of a national economy with capital markets.
But China's dearth of investment vehicles, a product of its underdeveloped capital markets, and a currency not yet fully convertible will thwart foreigners seeking early access to China's nascent, but potentially huge, funds industry.
The immediate role of foreign investors will be to provide expertise to allow China's domestic funds industry to develop on the back of domestic savings, Lo said.
""While we would not anticipate immediate direct overseas participation in the mainland's domestic fund markets, we believe that Hong Kong is in a unique position to play a key role in fostering the development of the fund industry,"" he said.
A series of training sessions are being set up in Hong Kong under the auspices of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Assocation and Hong Kong's financial markets regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, Lo said.
China is studying the feasibility of pilot schemes to allow Sino-foreign joint venture fund management companies to be set up to tap overseas fund management expertise, Lo said.
""This won't happen immediately, it's likely to take some time,"" Lo said. ""Ultimately, they very much see an investment industry as a way to develop their own economy.
""(Zhu) confirmed his understanding that our industry is very open and international and plays a major role fostering development of markets and the economy.""
Investors are already prepared for the moment China unveils the regulations governing the domestic funds industry.
""Once the rules are out, there are quite a few domestically managed funds waiting to start up,"" Lo said. Existing domestic financial markets and yuan-denominated bonds are likely recipients of interest from these funds, he said.
There are already about 70 closed-end funds in China with a total asset size of 5 billion yuan invested in projects, properties, stocks and bonds. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)

42,"The recent Asian tour by U.S. fund managers representing $234 billion in assets, including the hefty California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), has whetted Hong Kong fund managers' appetites.
""CalPERS has this innate ability of raising everybody's blood pressure because they've got so much money to invest. Get one percent and you double your assets under management,"" said Stewart Aldcroft, sales director for Templeton.
But it appears Hong Kong fund managers might be waiting in vain for a slice of the CalPERS pie.
While expressing a desire to raise their Asian and international weightings, the United States pension funds clearly stated a preference for direct investment over listed equity.
""The amount of transparency that we would expect with the companies is not available at this point,"" CalPERS board president William Crist said of Chinese public companies.
His statement highlighted a significant problem for U.S. money managers seeking increased exposure to Asia.
Foreign access to Asian markets is usually restricted, partly because many countries fear the sort of economic disruption that widened current account deficits after the last wall of foreign money came marching into the region in 1993.
Hong Kong fund managers, pointing to research indicating superior Asian performance by funds managed from within the region rather than from outside, said one option that could meet everybody's needs is private equity funds.
The performance of these funds is private but believed to far exceed that of public mutual funds.
Marcus Thompson, deputy managing director of HSBC Private Equity Management, said his funds hold $560 million, virtually all of it contributed by U.S. pension funds and invested in small companies expected to list within 10 years.
""Over the long term you're likely to get a superior investment performance,"" Thompson said. ""There's a discount for not being able to trade the stock.""
Cesar Zalamea, managing director of AIG Investment Corp (Asia) Ltd, declined to reveal the performance of his funds except to describe it as ""tremendous"".
AIG is the biggest private equity group active in Asia, with $2.38 billion under management -- nearly all of it rumoured to be contributed by one or two very big U.S. pension clients.
Zalamea said AIG's policy is always to hire Western-educated nationals who know the culture and the players in the indigenous business community. Established in Shanghai in 1919, AIG also has long-term relationships with many Asian corporations.
""When these (Asian corporations) decide they want to expand and invite investors outside family and close friends, we are naturals to be invited because (they) already know us,"" Zalamea said. ""CalPERS wouldn't have the kind of relationship.""
But there are disadvantages to private equity funds, the most obvious being their closed-end and long-term nature.
""One of the key issues about investment is to have your money back when you're ready to have it back, not when those in whom you are investing want you to have it back,"" said Aldcroft, who candidly admits Templeton wants to manage CalPERS money.
Another fund manager warned that while many venture capital funds do very well, others do not.
""The risk is higher. You don't have an out. The trick is in knowing how to say no,"" he said. ""If you haven't picked the right companies, how do you get out?""
"
42,"Blink and you missed it.
The much anticipated correction in Hong Kong stocks on Thursday on news of the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping gave fund managers all of 10 minutes to do some much-anticipated bargain hunting.
""This was not my expectation,"" said Ambrose Chang, chief investment officer at Daiwa Capital Management in Hong Kong.
Traders and fund managers said a huge bout of short-covering was responsible for the quick recovery on Thursday.
""It was futures driven,"" said one fund manager. ""The hedge funds came in and covered their positions and there were a lot of angry fund managers in London being woken up in the middle of the night by their brokers.""
After dipping 92 points at the opening, the Hang Seng index surged 305.01 points or 2.33 percent to close at 13,411.33 while the February index future ended 405 points higher at 13,485.
""The futures tried to open lower but there was no follow-through selling. All of a sudden they (the hedge funds) knew they were in trouble,"" one head trader said.
Clearly, it was the foreign funds, not the local punters, who got caught out.
""This news was in the market the whole week with certain people,"" said the head trader at one local house. ""I knew there was a massive short position in the market and after the first minute of trading, I wasn't at all surprised by what happened.""
Now that the dust has settled, fund managers are offering routine explanations for their near-term forecasts for the Hang Seng, all of them variations on the theme of a range-trade between 13,000 and 13,800.
U.S. interest rates and upcoming corporate earnings are expected to dictate direction, but most market players are expecting consolidation at current levels.
There were few reports of so-called ""top-slicing,"" or rotation of funds into other markets, although traders did report profit-taking in Singapore and Indonesia, both of which fell over the course of the week after recent strength.
Some funds said they had began cutting heavily overweight positions in Hong Kong when the Hang Seng hit 14,000 on January 16 and any further rotation is not justified given this week's strength.
Last week's action also proved the independence of Asian stocks, which were either unchanged or weaker on domestic factors when the Deng news hit.
""They're all completely sucked into their own things,"" one trader said.
Although individual factors helped push many indices lower through the region last week, traders and funds confirmed reports that institutional money was moving out of Asia and into Latin America.
""They can't find anything in Asia to buy,"" said one head trader. ""In Singapore and Malaysia, the earnings growth isn't massive and elsewhere it's not great. (Investors) expect better value in Latin America.""
One foreign fund manager said the flows were understandable given that Latin America is trading at about 12 percent earnings growth on a multiple of 11.5 times - 20 percent below the average Asian earnings multiple.
""And Southeast Asia is still going through this adjustment,"" he said.
""Global asset allocators still look at Asia as a region suffering from cost overruns, squeezed margins and, in some industries, a lack of pricing power.""

42,"Indonesia's nascent funds industry will remain dormant until the government steps in and provides a boost, experts attending a mutual fund conference said on Monday.
""There needs to be somebody giving them a push. The push can come not just from banks, not just from private institutions, but from the government,"" said Venkatagiri Mudeliar, deputy general manager of Dresdner Thornton Asset Management in Singapore.
Despite its obvious promise, Indonesia's mutual funds industry faces substantial obstacles, including unbeatable returns from bank deposits offering up to 17 percent per annum.
One speaker said that more than 60 percent of pension fund assets valued at US$2.4 billion were held in bank deposits. Seven newly-established mutual funds with assets of about US$642 million were similarly invested.
Among recommended measures at the conference were tax benefits for mutual fund investors, permission to allow domestic savings to flow offshore and a major educational drive.
Felia Salim, director of the Jakarta Stock Exchange, told the conference that government discussions to provide a tax break to mutual fund investors were underway, and more than 40 percent of the bourse's budget for 1997 was dedicated to educating the public about the benefits of mutual fund investment.
But delegates said with international investment prohibited and foreign investment restrictions of 49 percent, incentives to setting up investment management subsidiaries in Indonesia were limited despite the industry's promise.
""Internationally, it's always a nervous position for a foreign fund manager to be in when it appears investment is a one-way street,"" said Paul Smith, managing director at the Bank of Bermuda in Hong Kong.
Foreign fund managers would be more likely to establish fund management subsidiaries in Indonesia if there were opportunities to manage Indonesian money offshore, he said.
""It's a hard call to make for a foreign fund manager to come down here and set up shop just to manage Indonesian domestic mutual fund business, which at the moment is a very small pie,"" Smith said.
Mudeliar said Indonesia is clearly committed to speeding up the establishment of its financial infrastructure, and catching up with its more developed Southeast Asian neighbours.
""Yes, they have lost out for a number of years but as you know nowadays knowledge is so freely available that they don't have to wait a full 15 years or 20 years,"" Mudeliar said.
""(They can make a) quantum leap in another five years. They can buy expertise, they can buy information ... I think Indonesia will be something to reckon with in the next 10 years.""

42,"Thailand's efforts to boost market confidence by toughening up rules for its finance sector won mixed reviews from foreign investors on Tuesday.
Some welcomed Thailand's willingness to admit -- finally -- to asset quality problems in its finance sector, but others said Monday's announcement came far too late.
""This is fire-fighting,"" said one fund manager, who declined to be identified. ""They should have put the fire extinguishers and the sprinklers in beforehand. And now they've doused the flames, but the damage has already been done.""
On Monday, Thailand's central bank ordered 10 finance companies to raise capital immediately and raise provisioning levels to American standards of 115 percent of doubtful assets for banks and 120 percent for finance companies.
The moves followed months of speculation about asset quality that helped to shave half the value off the stock market while leaving the baht open to talk of a devaluation.
Fund Manager Templeton called for aggressive management of the problem.
""I think the central bank and the authorities need to take a very tough line and they need to be pretty active in the way in which they're going to manage this problem. Because this problem needs management,"" said sales director Stewart Aldcroft.
One fund manager said he was surprised the list of companies required to raise capital immediately was restricted to only 10 names. At least another 10 are in similar straits, he said.
Analysts said on Monday that only four or five banks would have to raise provisions to meet the new requirements, but most of the country's 90 finance companies cannot even meet existing requirements of 100-percent provisioning.
Thailand's willingness to confront the problem won praise from some investors, but most were unimpressed by the Bank of Thailand's tardy approach to a critical problem.
""We were frightened they would try to ignore the problem or gloss over it,"" said another fund manager. ""Now they have realised there is a problem and they're doing something about it, which is positive. But it's early days yet.""
One broker blamed changes in central bank leadership for the criticism. Previously, the Bank of Thailand was respected for its non-interventionist but pre-emptive management style.
""The bank seems to have gone astray in terms of its traditional role as a central bank,"" he said.
Another fund manager said corruption, a major complaint about the previous government, was starting to resurface.
""One of the biggest problems in Thailand is corruption,"" he said. ""The way in which political favouritism occurred in the past has become apparent in the current government.""
Thailand can now expect to begin a lengthy process of consolidation in its financial sector, with most of the activity focused on finance companies.
Most finance companies are heavily exposed to margin lending in investment banking and highly-leveraged in consumer or project finance, said James Wilson, senior associate director at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
""One issue that didn't crop up that should have, is most of the funding for finance companies is in the form of promissory notes,"" he said. ""When the risk goes up, so does their coupon and the cost of funding.""

42,"As Hong Kong speeds towards its return to Chinese rule, questions are being asked about the fate of its largest expatriate community -- tens of thousands of Filipina maids, or amahs.
Hong Kong relies upon its army of Filipina ""domestic helpers"". There were 140,000 of them at last count among the territory's 6.2 million population, and many people are heavily dependent upon their gentle and kind child-care.
""The help is so cheap you may as well have a few sprogs (children) while you're here,"" said one British banker with three young children, two Filipina maids and a very pregnant wife.
The Filipinas' contribution to their home nation is even more important. Most of the women are supporting families, and their monthly remittances account for a sizeable proportion of that nation's gross domestic product each year.
The arrangement works well, but it could be under threat. Concern is growing that once Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, the Filipinas will be booted out in favour of mainland Chinese women keen to earn hard currency in wealthy Hong Kong.
Recent statements of support for the status quo by Chinese president Jiang Zemin and Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive-designate, have failed to reassure those concerned for the well-being of these women, who face unemployment and an uncertain future in their home country.
""They have said the status quo will be maintained, but realistically there are going to be changes going into the handover,"" said Dennis Suico, chairman of the Philippine Association of Hong Kong.
""There will be a steady inflow of workers from the mainland. It may not be drastic, it may not happen overnight, but there is going to be change.""
SUNDAY GATHERINGS
The dark-haired women -- many of them college graduates, teachers and nurses -- are known in Hong Kong as the sparrows of Statue Square for their lively Sunday gatherings in the downtown plaza of that name.
Huddled underneath the imposing Hongkong Bank building, spilling out from overpasses humming with traffic, perched on plastic sheets on the ground at the Star Ferry terminal, thousands of chattering Filipinas crowd into the Central district each Sunday, forcing police to cordon off roads and redirect traffic.
""We have to do this, we have to,"" said Maria, 30. ""We work six days; on Sunday we have to enjoy ourselves.""
Wedged tightly between friends on a ledge outside Central subway station, Maria said she came to Hong Kong in order to support her 10-year-old daughter and unemployed husband, who can no longer work after an accident.
""I send back 7,000 pesos (US$270) each month,"" she said.
The money, a small fortune in impoverished Philippines, comes at a price. Most Filipinas' lives are marked by loneliness and separation from the people they care most about, and their working conditions are often hard.
""My employers are so selfish,"" said another Filipina. ""I have one day off every month, I have to get up at six o'clock and I cannot end until 11 o'clock. Please can you help me? Please help me leave here, to go to Canada or America.""
MINIMUM STANDARDS
The Hong Kong government sets minimum standards for domestic helpers in a standard two-year contract, which requires free room and board, minimum pay of about US$500 per month and one week's holiday a year.
But the Filipinas said that many employers, particularly the Chinese, are extremely demanding within those guidelines. The government recently announced random checks on employers to prevent the worst abuses, such as bedrolls in corridors.
Competition is keen for jobs with Western families, who tend to pay above the minimum rate, give two days off each week rather than one and offer a food allowance so that the Filipinas can avoid a foreign diet.
But when asked what they find most difficult about Hong Kong life, most Filipinas cite the separation from family. Many see their husbands and children for just one week a year.
Their situation is unlikely to improve much. Suico said that after the handover on July 1, many Chinese families and businessmen are likely to prefer a Chinese-speaking maid for better communication.
A number of business groups also support easier labour movement between Hong Kong and the rest of China, but government officials are on the record as having expressed concern about how best to handle the immigration implications of the handover.
Suico said the Filipinas are probably in a good position with younger families where both parents work and want their children to grow up speaking both Cantonese and English.
""And if you add to that the considerable numbers of the expatriate community here in Hong Kong, the senior executives, I think there is an overwhelming preference for an English-speaking domestic helper at home,"" he said.
But the number of expatriates on luxury packages is dwindling and the demand for domestic helpers is on the decline.
Filipinas are starting to ask where they should go next.
WHERE TO GO NEXT?
There is a huge migrant workforce of four million Filipinos the world over, most of them in the Middle East, but the case of Sarah Balabagan has confirmed that region as a potentially dangerous place for female workers.
Balabagan, 15, was convicted of murder in the United Arab Emirates after she stabbed to death an 84-year-old employer trying to rape her. ""The Middle East is not a good option for Filipinas,"" said Suico.
Instead, they are being encouraged to look for work in the affluent and emerging societies of Asia, such as Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia.

42,"Zero tax and limited regulation are luring billions of dollars into offshore mutual funds, spurring a growth industry in famed tax-free locations such as the Cayman Islands, according to a mutual fund legal expert.
""I think every indication is that the offshore part of the mutual fund industry will grow. In the offshore jurisdiction you have no taxation and a more appropriate level of regulation as a rule of thumb,"" said Anthony Travers, senior partner at Maples and Calder in Hong Kong.
Anecdotal evidence suggests these advantages have drawn nearly US$900 billion into offshore mutual funds so far out of an entire industry sometimes valued at US$5 trillion, he said.
A lack of professional infrastructure is often a compelling disincentive to authorising funds in countries offering the greatest returns, while high taxation levels deter mutual funds from setting up in promising developed markets, he said on Friday.
The alternative is to authorise the fund in an offshore region, avoiding tax while reaching into some of the world's most rewarding investment regions.
There are, however, drawbacks.
""If you go offshore and you invest into the onshore jurisdiction from your mutual funds, you have things like withholding tax and tax treatments that may be imposed on your profits, and marketing is very much an issue,"" Travers said.
Certain double tax treaty networks can allow investors to avoid some onshore tax requirements, but these treaties vary from country to country, as do marketing restrictions, he said.
For example, offshore mutual funds are prevented from marketing to more than 100 investors in the United States, while the United Kingdom prohibits marketing of offshore retail mutual funds unless they are based in designated jurisdictions, such as Bermuda, Jersey and Guernsey.
It is possible to market a Cayman Islands-registered mutual fund in the United Kingdom, but only as a private placement and not as a retail fund, Travers said.
Despite their obvious benefits, Travers warned that investing in offshore mutual funds is not for everyone.
The lack of regulation gives greater flexibility in the establishment and administration of mutual funds but it also provides little recourse for unsophisticated retail investors, which partly explains why these funds cannot be marketed freely in the United States or the United Kingdom.
""You are essentially talking about mutual funds which are established by institutions for other institutions or very high net worth and sophisticated individuals, in which case it is felt additional layers of regulation are not appropriate or necessary,"" he said.
It is possible to market offshore retail funds in Europe, but funds must meet the requirements of the ""Undertakings of Collective Investment and Transfer of Securities"" (UCITS) directive, which ensures certain standards are met.
""They are supposed to be able to sell UCITS cross-border in Europe but in fact the European Union is still something of a myth when it comes to cross-border marketing,"" Travers said.
""And you find in these jurisdictions commensurately higher fees. Three to six basis points on net asset value is the price you pay to market to the retail sector,"" he said.

42,"Hong Kong people seemed to forget politics and other worries as the tiny colony geared up to welcome the Year of the Ox, its last Lunar New Year celebrations under British rule.
With the clock ticking towards transition to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30, Hong Kong's 6.3 million people took time out from hectic schedules for the Chinese equivalent of a western Christmas or American Thanksgiving.
Last-minute shoppers dashed through malls, record numbers of travellers flowed across the border to visit relatives in China and children threw empty red ""lai see"" money pockets at each other on Hong Kong harbour's Star Ferry.
""Kung Hei Fat Choi, may you be rich and make more money,"" said resident Ng Chak Kwong. ""Everybody wants this to be a good year. Too many people worry about everything.""
But the cheerful greeting cards, office towers ablaze with lights, strings of red firecrackers and little orange trees offered few clues to Hong Kong's real state of mind on New Year's eve.
This year's festivities were set against a backdrop of rising political tension after China's recent pledge to roll back some civil liberties laws following the handover, plans that sparked an outcry both at home and abroad.
The Democratic Party, the territory's largest party, collected 20,000 signatures opposing the plans while the international community lodged official protests with China.
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said on Wednesday Hong Kong's return to the motherland would end ""the disgrace and humiliation China has suffered from for more than 150 years"".
Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa, the man who takes over from colonial Governor Chris Patten after the handover, last week defended Beijing's proposed changes as misunderstood, but few were convinced.
Patten, in a televised new year address, said he would leave Hong Kong with ""a good deal of nostalgia, a good deal of feeling for one of the finest places in the world, one of the greatest cities in the world"".
""I'm sure that Mr Tung -- when he becomes Chief Executive... will be committed to doing all he can to keep things that way,"" he said.
Most Hong Kong people seemed determined to ignore politics during the holiday. Four days of parades and fairs were planned, and spectacular fireworks were to light up the sky on Saturday.
According to Chinese astrologers, the coming year offers Hong Kong plenty of promise but obstacles as well.
Unlike Western astrology, where months of the year are grouped into separate star signs, Chinese astrology hinges on the year of birth.
That could mean bad news for Tung, who was born in 1937, the Year of the Ox.
According to the astrologer at the South China Morning Post newspaper, Tung faced a difficult year marked by envy and accident and he was advised to seek compromise.
""He is likely to be caught between Hong Kong people and the Chinese government and may be the object of envy by mainland officials,"" warned astrologer Sung Siu-kwong.
Patten, born under the sign of the Monkey in 1944, was warned about the emergence of a rival in mid-year and cautioned to draw a line between private and public involvements.
""He will need to overcome obstacles that can stand in the way of the glorious withdrawal,"" Sung said.

42,"Guinness Flight Asia said on Thursday that the selection of Hong Kong's new chief executive next month could give further support to the territory's soaring Hang Seng Index, which it expects to rise to 14,000 points soon.
""Once the chief executive is chosen, the direction of economic policy after the handover will be clearer,"" the fund manager said in an Asian quarterly outlook.
""Since it is clearly in China's interest that the handover should proceed smoothly, China will seek to ensure that it does nothing to adversely affect sentiment. Investors are increasingly coming to regard the handover as a positive rather than a negative.""
The British territory returns to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. The chief executive, who will govern Hong Kong as a special administrative region of China following the transition, will be announced on December 11.
Guinness Flight is maintaining a heavily overweight position on the Hong Kong stock market, and investment director Nerissa Lee said she holds a three-month target of 14,000 points for the Hang Seng Index.
""Hong Kong has done very well and we're still very bullish,"" she said. ""I think it will continue to do well for some time because money will flow into Hong Kong as the preferred market (in Asia) and will stay here for some time.""
Lee said Hong Kong will benefit from the credit easing in China, which will offset any interest rate hike in the United States this year or next, with additional support from subdued inflation and a strong property market.
Guinness Flight is also overweight in China, where it expects company profits to recover strongly as the effects of the austerity programme ease.
""It's time to take a look at China,"" Lee said. ""We are at the start of a cyclical uptrend.""
She forecasts Chinese economic growth of 9.8 percent this year, rising to 10.2 percent next year, in a context of a carefully controlled credit easing that will be channelled into selective sectors and industries.
While exports are expected to recover from this year's weakness, China's economy will also benefit from an increase in investment and consumption, she said.
""The last cycle of growth was led by exports but in this cycle we believe it will be very much more broadly based,"" Lee said, who favours power, automobiles and consumer products as China's most promising sectors in the short term.
Huaneng International Power Company is her top power stock, thanks to an aggressive capacity expansion, while Qingling Motors Co Ltd leads the automobile pack.
Qingling stock is trading in single digit multiples, despite a 20-percent share of China's expanding car market that is expected to rise to 30 percent next year.
Earnings at Guangnan Ltd, an integrated food distributor poised to exploit a boom in Chinese supermarket consumption, could rise 30 percent each year for the next three years, Lee said.
Goldlion Holdings Ltd remains Guinness Flight's favoured retail stock, reporting an annual net profit growth of more than 40 percent each year for the past seven years.
""This is an excellent track record and proof of the quality of management at the company,"" Lee said.

28,"Russia's second-generation, billion-dollar foreign oil projects are finding out that close ties to top government figures, delicate talks with new partners and careful handling of oil-rich, ambitious regions are vital.
Western oil companies eyeing Arctic reserves need close Kremlin relationships and savvy negotiating skills more than ever, now that Moscow has a cooler, tougher attitude toward Western participation in oil production-sharing deals.
Support from President Boris Yeltsin, who oversaw the transformation of the oil sector into privatised companies and who underwent heart surgery on Tuesday, is crucial.
So is a willingness to get out the pencils and redo budgets after talks with increasingly demanding Russian partners.
The factors -- some old, some new --  will decide whether deals stay on the drawing board or get off the ground.
In one of Russia's most prominent projects, Amoco Corp of the United States and Russian oil giant YUKOS are in tortuous talks that, analysts said, revolve around how to accomodate YUKOS shareholder Bank Menatep.
""Any time you add a new player to the game, you need to re-establish what the ground rules are,"" said Dan Westbrook, senior vice-president and resident manager of Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, in a recent telephone interview.
Leading commercial bank Menatep owns a 33 percent stake in YUKOS, Russia's second largest oil producer, and controls a further 45 percent stake formally owned by the government.
The two companies plan to spend $50 billion or so to tap the huge Priobsk oil field, which could hold 610 million recoverable tonnes, in Siberia's Tyumen region.
Russia's first-generation foreign oil deals, all off the Russian Far Eastern island of Sakhalin, took forever to hammer out but largely gave Western partners the leading equity stakes they demanded as insurance for the political risk of investing.
Now, years later, Moscow officials say quietly that Russia should have at least equal status, if not the upper hand.
That makes Kremlin and Fuel and Energy Ministry patronage as important as ever to getting deals to the production stage.
Succesful implementation of projects is still heavily dependent on people at the top, like Yeltsin -- thus showing the enduring power of personalities to moving oil deals forward in Russia, in spite of Moscow's moves to make laws, not people, the framework for investments.
The Timan-Pechora Company, or TPC, which groups Texaco, Amoco, Exxon, Norsk Hydro AS Russia's Rosneft and an exploration outfit in a $40 billion project in the Timan-Pechora basin, saw negotiations temporarily halt over the unexpected death of a key Russian negotiating partner.
TPC President Tom Hazen said he was confident talks to tap up to 360 million tonnes of oil would continue with a special Russian delegation after the Fuel and Energy Ministry selects a replacement for deceased delegation leader Vadim Dvurechensky, who was also a deputy Fuel and Energy minister.
""We are hopeful to continue our negotiations with the special delegation,"" Hazen said.
""There are very few remaining outstanding issues. I certainly wouldn't draw any conclusions that there have been a lack of negotiations or a termination of discussions.""
Both Westbrook and Hazen declined to say when their projects could be finalised.
Western oil companies have a new worry -- the growing demands by oil-rich regions for a bigger cut in deals.
Interfax news agency earlier this week quoted the chairman of the State Duma lower parliament house's Committee on Natural Resources as saying that the Nenets regional Duma had recommended the government break off talks with TPC over regional tax issues.

28,"Russia, hoping to boost industrial output, announced plans on Monday for lower electricity and rail transport prices, cheering energy-hungry aluminium plants but worrying Western economists.
President Boris Yeltsin's press service said Yeltsin had signed a decree at the weekend cutting wholesale electricity charges for industrial and residential customers from November 1 by an average 10 percent from their August 1 levels.
The decree also promised to rein in runaway rail transport charges, saying tariffs for transport by rail on electric locomotives would be set by the new electricity pricing rules.
Yeltsin's decree also promised to create a wholesale natural gas market by next year.
By bringing order to unruly pricing structures, the decree also aims to improve tax collection.
Privatised aluminium smelters in Russia, one of the world's largest producers, said the new rules would help them save them money as electricity and transport are two of the major costs in producing and exporting the non-ferrous metal.
But Yeltsin's decree aroused doubt from Western economists, who called it little more than a short-term way of plugging the budget deficit and unsustainable in the long run.
""Of course this makes us happy,"" said a representative in Moscow of the big Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter.
But he declined to say how it would affect output.
""It's not sustainable in the long term,"" said a top Western economist. ""Over the short term, it will reduce production costs, but it does nothing to solve nonpayments.""
Boris Arlyuk, managing director of St Petersburg-based Alumconsult, said that Russia's average industrial electricity prices were already much higher than world charges.
But Russian smelters rarely pay full price, thus helping to fuel a massive non-payments cycle in which aluminium plants -- a major consumer of electricity -- owe regional utilities for supplies, who in turn owe the state unpaid taxes.
Yeltsin's decree is partly designed to break this cycle.
The decree also said gas and electricity producers would be liable for excise and profits tax on proceeds from collecting debts for their supplies, as long as these proceeds did not fall below the actual cost of producing and transmitting supplies.
That means it could become easier for utilities to collect money from aluminium producers and other industrial customers.
Arlyuk said domestic electricity tariffs vary greatly, with the Kandalaksha aluminium smelter in the European part of Russia charged the rouble equivalent of $25 per megawatt hour, and using 17 megawatt hours to produce each tonne.
But rates at the giant Bratsk smelter in Siberia were the equivalent of $6 per megawatt hour -- the same, Arlyuk said, as in big aluminium producing countries like Canada and Norway.
Bratsk, using 17.7 megawatt hours per tonne of produced aluminium, spent only $106 per tonne on electricity compared to about $425 per tonne for Kandalaksha.
Dmitry Kryukov, a utilities analyst at Renaissance Capital, said that partly privatised national power company Unified Energy System (RAO Yedinaya Energeticheskaya Sistema) would see lower revenues.
But he said its cash flow could improve since it would be taxed only when paid for deliveries, and not before.
Still, Anatoly Gamanov, head of tariffs at the aluminium producers' group Kontsern Alyuminiy, said he doubted regional utilities would be happy to receive less for their supplies.
""This is not the first time we've seen something like this, and some regional utilities may put up a fight.""
UES owns 29 power plants and holds 49 percent stakes in most of the privatised ""energo"" regional utilities.
Electricity and rail tariffs have risen faster than the overall producers price index, prompting Kremlin officials to seek ways to give industrial producers a break.

28,"The head of war-torn Chechnya's oil company said on Thursday that Russia's rebellious region would guarantee the safety of a major oil pipeline across its land but demanded a cut in foreign deals that will use the link.
Khozhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Southern Oil Company, which is based in the devastated capital Grozny, told a news conference that an $8 billion multinational consortium that will use the link to export oil in 1997 should not worry because the pipeline was safe and sound.
""We guarantee the link's safety,"" he said. ""But remember that with pipelines all over the world, things sometimes happen -- sabotage, technical errors, human errors.""
He said Chechnya should get a cut from transit fees via the so-called northern link, which can carry 17 million tonnes of oil a year.
""The Chechen part is approximately in the same condition as the rest of the link,"" he said, referring to the stretch running through Grozny and linking the Azeri capital Baku to Russia's Black Sea oil export outlet of Novorossiisk.
The 13 international oil companies in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company plan to reverse the flow of the pipeline to ship up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of early oil from their Caspian offshore projects near Baku from August 1997.
The consortium is led by an alliance of British Petroleum Plc and Norway's Statoil.
Protracted bloodshed and instability in the 21-month Chechen conflict have given the consortium the jitters ever since Moscow sent troops into Grozny in December 1994 in a bloody bid to rein in the breakaway region.
The oil firms, worried that exports from their big ticket investments could fall prey to a separatist war, have access to a second export route via the former Soviet republic of Georgia.
Underscoring the fragility of the region for oil investors, six foreigners working with the International Committee of the Red Cross were shot dead at a Chechen hospital on Wednesday and six ethnic Russians were killed on Thursday.
Yarikhanov, who said he had faced a cool reception at Russia's Transneft oil pipeline monopoly, which owns and operates the pipeline, and at the Fuel and Energy Ministry, said Moscow was not doing enough to resurrect the region's once-glorious oil sector.
While he said the pipeline was no worse for the war, Chechnya's production and refining facilities had been laid waste.
At least eight trillion roubles ($1.44 billion) were needed to bring the facilities back on line. Yarikhanov said financing could come from a Chechen cut in the transport fees that the Azeri oil consortium will pay to ship oil via Chechnya.
""We want our share of profits from the transport of oil across our country,"" he said, adding the Azeri group would pay $16.57 per tonne to send oil from its Caspian Sea platforms near Baku to Novorossiisk.
The Azeri oil consortium also includes Azeri state firm SOCAR, Amoco Corp, Pennzoil Co, Unocal Corp, Exxon Corp, Ramco Energy Plc, Russia's LUKoil, Turkish TRAO, McDermott International Inc, Itochu Corp and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir.
The Southern Oil Company, also called the Chechen Oil Company, had hoped to stabilise output at three to four million tonnes a year before the breakaway region descended into bloodshed.
Chechnya accounted for one-third of Soviet oil production in the 1970s, or around 22 million tonnes a year, before Moscow began tapping its massive Siberian reserves.
Refining capacity in the south Caucasian region is 20-22 million tonnes a year, but operations have ceased.

28,"Russia is eyeing its second consecutive bad grain harvest and will need imports despite a prediction by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that output will be enough to meet demand, industry sources said Tuesday.
""The sheer volume Russia will produce is enough to meet demand, but the quality is not,"" said specialist Andrei Sizov of the independent consultancy SovEcon Ltd. ""So it is fully possible that Russia will be forced to go to Western markets.""
Chernomyrdin, in a speech to the Federation Council, the upper parliament house, forecast 1996 grain output of 77-78 million metric tons, ""significantly higher"" than last year's harvest of 63.4 million tons.
""This will allow us to provide the population with bread and bread products until the new (1997) harvest, to prepare enough concentrated feed grains and to increase grain reserves,"" a copy of Chernomyrdin's speech read.
But grain sources have said private-sector buying would still take place. ""We have a shortage of first-class wheat,"" Georgy Zelinsky, general director of the agricultural trade association Khleboproduktprogress, told an industry seminar.
Sizov said piecemeal Russian imports of grain and flour in grain equivalent from all sources would rise to 5.0-6.0 million tons over the 1996/1997 crop year, from 4.5 million in 1995/1996 crop year.
Anatoly Manellya, head of agricultural forecasting at the Centre for Economic Trends, a think-tank set up by the government, said he thought imports could be even higher.
Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun has said Russia may import up to 4.5 million tons of corn and soymeal, plus 500,000 tons of wheat from the United States, Canada and/or Australia.
Zelinsky said domestic feed corn was in short supply, but corn for human consumption was not.
But industry sources said Western markets should not expect sudden announcements of big purchases. Rather, Russia would buy piecemeal in small lots, they said.
Sizov said imports of Western grain could be possible because Ukrainian flour supplies would slip due to very poor harvest outlook there.
""Russia has become the world's largest flour importer,"" he said, referring to imports which increased to one million tons in the 1995/1996 crop year, a rise of 25-30 times from the previous year.
Industry sources said the most likely buyers would be the dozen or so Russian commercial banks authorised to use U.S. government commodities credits.
Russia has used nearly all its reserves from the 1995 harvest, the worst in three decades. It survived largely due to carryover stocks from the 1994 harvest.
"
28,"Russia's Finance Ministry said on Thursday that Moscow was ready to cooperate with De Beers on a deal which a deputy minister said was vital to support the diamond market.
""The Russian Federation is further ready to cooperate with the De Beers company in the matter of continued support of the stability of the world diamond market,"" it said in a statement.
However, the ministry said it had received no official word from the South African group on its announcement on Wednesday that it had given the Russian government until the end of the year to sign a new trade agreement to export Russian rough gems.
The statement said the ministry, which plays a key role in the trade agreement, was studying what it termed De Beers' unilateral cessation of an agreement to sell Russian gems through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation.
De Beers had said not that it was unilaterally halting the agreement, but that if a formal deal were not reached by 1997, it would cancel its interim arrangement with Russia.
De Beers said it had made its announcement on Wednesday because its patience had worn thin over government delays in replying to the long-delayed deal.
First Deputy Economy Minister Vladimir Panskov said an agreement with De Beers was necessary.
""If this agreement is not signed, we will simply destroy the world diamond market. Neither the De Beers company nor Russia will be able to work normally without such an agreement,"" Interfax news agency quoted Panskov as saying.
De Beers controls about three quarters of the world diamond market and Russia accounts for about 25 percent of all rough gems De Beers sells.
A five-year deal expired in December 1995 and was replaced by a memorandum signed in February 1996.
Panskov said that in the course of work on the agreement, differences of opinion between Russian diamond producer Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS), domestic gem processing plants and De Beers had become clear.
""But I think that in any circumstances we cannot set off on the road of mutual ultimatums.""
A senior official with ARS said the Russian government had been dragging its feet on the deal with De Beers but he thought a deal would come in 1997.
Interfax quoted Lev Safonov, first vice president of the company, as saying that if an interim agreement were broken off before a new deal was in place, the two sides would conduct trade under ""other conditions"".
"
28,"Russia said on Wednesday it would restructure natural gas monopoly Gazprom's operations, but Western analysts and even a junior company official said the move would leave the world's largest gas company intact.
""What Gazprom has suggested for itself is not a restructuring but a commercialisation of their services in Russia,"" said Jonathan Stern, vice-president of Gas Strategies in London and an expert on Russian gas.
Asked if Russia would reshape one of its most powerful companies in the formal sense of the word, Stern said: ""No. But it is corporatisation in the Western sense.""
Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin told a news conference the goverment would restructure Gazprom's home operations and possibly split its domestic output and transport arms.
He said the changes at Gazprom -- whose American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) keep investors drooling -- would in no way affect foreign shareholders.
""Domestic restructuring, yes. But we will not weaken Gazprom as an international corporation,"" he said.
Carving up Gazprom, whose gas accounts for 60 percent of Europe's gas imports, could deregulate the firm along the lines of British Gas Plc if carried out Western style.
""There's more smoke than fire here,"" said Stephen O'Sullivan, associate oil and gas director at MC Securities in London. ""I don't think there's any serious restructuring here.
""Third-party access is not enshrined in Russia,"" he said, referring to the fact that Gazprom controls 94 percent of Russia's gas production and most of its transmission but has hesitated to allow other companies sell its output.
Lira Rozenova, an economic adviser to Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev, said any changes would keep the company whole.
""An Economy Ministry programme to 2000 assumes that restructuring and state regulation in the gas industry will be carried out while preserving in the medium-term the organisational and production unity of RAO Gazprom,"" she said.
Gazprom accounts for a quarter of world gas output and its 1996 production rose one percent to 575 billion cubic metres (20.31 trillion cu ft). It raised $429 million last year with ADRs and plans a Eurobond issue this year.
""ADR investors should be more worried about other things,"" O'Sullivan said, citing questions over whether Gazprom will ever liberalise trade in its very illiquid shares in Russia.
Stern said Yasin's remarks were essentially about accounting changes rather than structural ones.
""Transport units would pay the producers' units costs,"" he said, adding that the plan aimed to improve Gazprom finances. ""The Russians don't mean what we mean by restructuring.""
A senior British energy consultant said Yasin's remarks were ""kite-flying by the government"".
Gazprom was once an entire ministry run by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Analysts said the firm would owe $7-$8 billion in annual taxes to the government if it could collect 50 trillion roubles in domestic debts.
Gazprom still has friends in high places and plans to sell even more gas to Europe from vast untapped Arctic reserves. But it has come under pressure to contribute more to the federal budget.
But Moscow may lack the will to alter one of Russia's most profitable and powerful firms substantially.
""Periodically, some radical economists in Russia have suggested truly restructuring Gazprom,"" Stern said. ""But they have always failed. The political risk of destroying the Gazprom structure is too great.""

28,"Russian oil company officials said on Friday that Moscow would not slap a duty on heavy fuel oil exports this winter, leaving traders to breathe a sigh of relief but still wary of secretive government manoeuvres.
The prospect of no restrictions on exports of mazut, as Russian heavy fuel oil is known, soothed traders who had been worried about short supplies of Russian material, which keep much of European and Mediterranean markets warm.
But while traders said they were now almost one hundred percent certain there would be no export duty, they cautioned that anything could happen in the Byzantine world of Russia.
""I am convinced that there will be no duty -- but I also know how all sorts of unexpected nightmares can happen in Russia,"" said a source at a European buyer in Moscow.
State oil holding company Rosneft's chief spokesman Vladimir Tumarkin told Reuters that a Fuel and Energy Ministry plan for a duty had fallen flat on its face with senior cabinet officials.
""They (the government) have decided not to introduce any restrictions,"" he said.
A second official at Rosneft, which ministry employees said was handling the mazut issue, also said there would be no duty.
""It is safe to say there will be no duty. It's too late. We had all expected one, but it has not come,"" Gennady Grigoryev, deputy head of Rosneft's financial-commercial directorate, said.
The Rosneft officials said Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov -- who had reiterated publicly as recently as last month that there would be a duty -- had failed to excite Kremlin officials with the idea.
""Rodionov was insisting on his position, but there are many corridors of power in Russia and he just did not score enough points with government officials to get them to agree to this,"" one of the Rosneft officials said.
One trader likened Rodionov's comments to ""a soldier's talk designed to pump people up and reflect his interests"".
""It's really possible it's true (that there will be no export duty),"" said a senior trader at a European company.
""But it comes a little too late to make me happy. I'm not thinking about mazut until May or so.""
Russian heavy fuel oil exports tail off sharply in the colder winter season from November to around May, as waterways and export outlets freeze and consumption increases at home.
The mazut export issue was a hot item of debate in government halls, with Rodionov's camp arguing for a tariff to bolster domestic supplies, and those against the proposal saying Russia needed fewer restrictions and more of a market economy.
Traders are conditioned to expect a Russian heavy fuel oil export restriction.
Moscow raised the export tariff on mazut to 16 Ecus per tonne from six Ecus during December 1995 to March 1996 to curb deliveries abroad. It banned mazut exports outright from December 1994 to April 1995.
""Russia has grown up,"" said one of the traders, adding that the decision not to levy a tariff was a triumph for Russia's new market-minded leaders over the old generation.
""I think there were a lot of people in the government who realised that such tariffs are just not advantageous.""

28,"Russia is trying to shift financing of its tarnished gold sector to commercial banks while keeping control of exports, putting it on a collision course with the banks who say sales abroad are what interest them.
Moscow bullion officials view recent Central Bank decisions outlining new procedures for working with gold as a cautious, experimental step toward opening one of the country's most closed industries, the banks say.
""Administrative measures in Russia always mean something,"" said Dmitry Smirnov, head of precious metals operations at Vneshtorgbank, commenting on whether recent changes detailing accounting procedures for working with gold were Soviet-style bureaucratic paper-shuffling or more significant.
But he said: ""Honestly, I wouldn't expect a sharp rise in output any time soon.""
Russian bullion officials say they want to open up the domestic market, since the federal budget can no longer finance gold output or keep the state's strategic reserves well-stocked.
Canadian industry sources say Russia has the world's third-largest untapped gold reserves but is only the world's fifth-largest producer, a fact that reflects the difficulty it is having in channeling funds to mines.
Output in 1995 fell to about 130 tonnes and will slip in 1996 and 1997. About 130 banks have the right to trade in gold domestically but only five to eight can export gold abroad.
Banks financed only five tonnes of output last year.
Western bullion bankers say bank-financed output makes Russia a potential loose cannon on world markets, since it could quickly send output soaring.
Gold, which struck three-year lows earlier this week but has picked up slightly since, hovered around $368 an ounce on Thursday on the London Metal Exchange.
Domestic banks, some of which bought government gold-backed certificates in 1991 which they cashed in for metal, may already have significant stockpiles of gold which they are unable to export due to strict quota and licensing rules.
Boris Yeltsin's press service said on Thursday the president had decreed that Russia would not issue certificates backed by about 30 tonnes of gold as planned last year.
""I know that there are a lot of banks with a lot of gold that they are just waiting to sell abroad,"" said Dmitry Parmeshin, head of Inkombank's precious metals sales section.
""We all want to take this stuff out if the (domestic) market becomes liberalised enough.""
Bankers declined to put a figure on the number of tonnes of gold held in Russian commercial banks, but one said the figure could be at least in the dozens.
The Central Bank in October introduced new accounting procedures for banks seeking to work on the domestic gold market. But the institution still largely controls exports through quotas and licences.
Interfax news agency quoted Central Bank precious metals director Sergei Kyshtymov as saying the rules would soon be simplified further.
""This can be viewed as the first step toward a more open gold market in Russia,"" said Sergei Brazhenko, deputy head of precious metals department at Rossiisky Kredit, one of the few banks with a licence to export gold abroad.
""The task is to hook up our output with world market demand, given that our domestic consumption is low.""
Bullion bankers said domestic consumers bought 15 tonnes of gold last year, mostly as jewellery -- but they said trade restrictions hid the fact that consumer demand was higher.
""Once things become truly liberalised, the domestic market could really explode,"" Parmeshin said.
"
28,"Russia's oil sector has staged its first real comeback by nearly closing the door on a decade of dizzying output declines, but analysts said on Monday that the troubled industry was not yet in the clear.
""The larger declines are over; is that a turnaround? Yes,"" said Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch, commenting on 1996 oil production figures.
The State Statistics Committee said Russia's 1996 crude oil output fell two percent on 1995 levels to 293 million tonnes (around 5.86 million barrels per day).
That is Russia's lowest crude oil output rate in nearly three decades.
But the decline is the smallest since Russia -- still the world's third-largest oil producer -- discovered its huge West Siberian reserves and pushed oil output to a peak 570 million tonnes (11.4 million bpd) in 1987.
The story has been a downhill one ever since, and double-digit percentage output declines throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s have left Russia's 1996 output at a meagre 51 percent of 1987's record level.
But the picture, as the 1996 data shows, is getting prettier.
""The fall is finally coming to an end,"" said Stephen O'Sullivan, associate director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London. ""It's not just a flash in the pan like LUKoil -- it's clearly more broad-based.""
Analysts say the recovery showed its first real signs in the second quarter of 1996, possibly as Russian producers began to cash in on a world oil price rally and jammed export outlets.
But not all analysts were as sanguine about 1996's results.
""The fact that it almost levelled out this year is significant,"" said a U.S. oil executive involved in the Petroleum Advisory Forum, a Moscow lobby of foreign oil majors.
""But I don't really think it means a whole lot, because there's a problem with domestic demand and with export capacity. It doesn't make sense for producers to produce as much as they can right now.""
Russia's oil firms have limited export options and other domestic industries are recovering more slowly.
Russian gross domestic product fell by six percent in 1996 and industrial output shrank in every sector of the economy to plunge five percent overall, official figures showed.
Declining domestic demand spurred Russian exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States to rise by five percent in the first 11 months of 1996 to 92.8 million tonnes.
But analysts say Russia's increasingly hungry tax-man has eaten up a large portion of the extra export earnings, leaving Russia's newly-privatised companies with little to reinvest.
Still, the export boom has spurred Russia's 13 or so vertically-integrated oil companies' appetite for growth, and both Lubash and O'Sullivan said domestic crude oil demand might pick up slightly next year.
""Any arrest in decline must be heartening and what we must be looking to see is some growth,"" said Martin Cocker, a partner in Ernst &amp; Young's World Energy Group unit in Moscow.
But Russia's oil companies, most heading into their third or fourth years as restructured, privatised companies, will have problems in breaking completely free of Russia's economic woes.
""It's all a function of when domestic industry turns around,"" said the U.S. executive. ""Producers and refiners both have an incentive to export and will for quite some time.""
"
28,"A multinational group trying to build a $1.5 billion oil pipeline linking Kazakhstan and Russia held frantic, last-minute talks on Friday to try to resolve how much involvent Russia's pipeline firm will have in the deal.
The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, or CPC, which groups eight international oil companies and the states of Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman, hoped to sign off on a new restructuring deal on Friday afternoon after talks.
But Western oil executives and Russian energy officials, speaking hours before they hoped to sign, said it was far from clear what would happen because of a last-minute push by Russia's Transneft oil pipeline monopoly to take potentially the largest equity stake in the scheme.
""Are we going to sign? Well, I hope so, but I cannot say for sure,"" said a Western executive representing a CPC shareholder. ""We're burning the midnight oil to work out the issues.""
State-run Transneft's bid to be not just the operator but also a shareholder and strategic decision-maker in the group has made the Western shareholders very uneasy.
""Transneft could end up being the equity holder representing the Russian government,"" said one senior CPC source.
A breakthrough deal in April 1996 brought on board new equity holders but has yet to produce a share transfer. The companies involved are Chevron, which will own 15 percent of CPC, Russia's LUKoil with 12.5 percent, Mobil and Russia's Rosneft, 7.5 percent each, British Gas Plc and Italy's Agip SpA, two percent each, and Oryx Energy Company and Kazakhstan's Munaigaz 1.75 percent each.
The remaining 50 percent stake would be divided between Russia, 24 percent, Kazakhstan, 19 percent, and Oman, through the Oman Oil Company with seven percent. Transneft, with backing from Moscow, wants the other participants to agree to it taking the Russian government's 24 percent stake.
The proposed 1,580 km (990 mile) pipeline to link Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field and Russia's Black Sea oil export outlet Novorossiisk would give Chevron and Mobil, partners in Tengiz, a much-needed dedicated export route for output that will peak at around 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2010.
But if Transneft takes all or part of Russia's nearly one-quarter stake, it could use its leverage to raise transit tariffs or insist that some Russian oil flow through the link, which would cut into the economics of Chevron's and Mobil's $20 billion TengizChevroil (TCO) project and other Kazakh oil deals.
""The concern is Transneft's role in the management of the project. Conflict of interest is something very unpalatable to the Western side,"" a CPC source said.
Transneft spokesman Ravil Polyanin said the monopoly wanted the whole 24 percent stake and to be the operator of the pipeline, but that it might settle for a smaller equity share.
""Various states have used Russia's pipeline system in the past without contributions to Transneft,"" he said.
CPC executives are anxious to sign a deal, since the project is already years behind schedule and has stymied development of Caspian oil fields that require export routes before they can be economically tapped.
""There is an awful lot of pressure to sign,"" said one source.
But four senior Western CPC shareholders, including Mobil Oil Kazakstan Inc president Carl Burnett, told Reuters last month that if a deal was signed on Friday, it would probably not be for the crucial share transfer, the key step to getting the project off the ground.
The Caspian pipeline, to be built in phases across southern Russia but bypassing war-torn Chechnya, could eventually carry 1.4 million barrels per day, but other Kazakh projects will take up the extra capacity and leave little room for Russian oil.
"
10,"Japan's big securities houses have come to accept that deregulating commissions on stock transactions is essential if they are to keep their major customers, industry sources say.
""Many Japanese brokers oppose liberalisation, but it is unavoidable if they want to keep the status of the Tokyo stock market from falling,"" one industry source said.
The sources cited an increase in ""black-eyed"" foreigners -- Japanese who buy Japanese stocks through brokers overseas to avoid higher commissions charged by domestic brokers.
However, the sources also said deregulation should be done gradually so as not to jeopardise small brokerages depending on commissions for most of their revenue.
""Big Four brokers will be able to withstand the impact of liberalisation, but smaller brokers will not,"" the source said.
Japan's ""Big Four"" -- Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities -- are preparing for the liberalisation of broking fees as they fear they will lose customers, who are becoming more aware that it is cheaper to place orders abroad for Japanese stocks than it is in Japan, the sources said.
Japanese brokers charge 535,000 yen ($4,908) for buying or selling a contract worth 500 million yen ($4.58 million), the sources said, while fees overseas would be less than half that.
The Big Four depended on commissions for about 30 percent of their revenue in the fiscal year to March 31, 1995.
But commissions accounted for more than 70 percent of revenues for many of Japan's 230 smaller brokerages, they said.
Earlier this year, the Pension Welfare Service Public Corp (Nenpuku), which manages about 23 trillion yen ($211 billion) in public pension funds, commissioned investment advisory companies to manage its funds.
""Those investment advisory companies set up so-called limited partnerships abroad and placed orders in London,"" said another industry source.
""By trading in the over-the-counter market in London, they saved money as stockbroking fees there are cheap and there is no securities transaction tax.""
This triggered interest from other institutional investors, the sources said.
While no statistics are available, purchases by the so-called black-eyed investors had recently inflated figures for purchases of Japanese stocks by foreigners, they said.
Atsushi Nagano, director-general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau, told Reuters the ministry was aware of the situation.
""Watching such cases, I feel like there is something wrong in the Tokyo market,"" he said.
When Japan liberalised broking fees for contracts of more than 1 billion yen ($9.1 million) in April 1994, the Finance Ministry said it would consider deregulating fees on smaller lots of stocks after seeing the impact of that liberalisation.
Industry sources said further deregulation would be one of the main topics at a special committee of the Securities and Exchange Council -- an advisory panel to the Finance Minister -- which is supposed to present proposals on how to reform Tokyo's securities market next June.
The second source said that even though no time frame had been set for the complete liberalisation of commissions, abolishing the securities transaction tax would help boost the Tokyo exchange.
Japan lowered the tax to 0.21 percent of the value of a sale from 0.3 percent, except for sales by securities houses, on April 1.
Broking fees were liberalised in New York in 1975 and in London in 1986. ($1=109)

10,"Japanese banks, still struggling under the weight of massive problem loans, now face tough decisions on how to adapt to expected structural changes to the country's economy and financial system, analysts say.
They say it is inevitable the banks will need to shift their focus towards creating new business and offering specific services to boost profits as demand for loans weakens.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's ""Big Bang"" financial reform plans unveiled last month to liberalise Japan's financial markets by 2001 will also accelerate competition.
""To increase profitability, Japanese banks must change the sources of their profits,"" said Koyo Ozeki, a director at international credit rating agency IBCA Ltd.
On Thursday, the Finance Ministry announced sweeping plans to deregulate Japan's foreign exchange market in 1998.
Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, warned that Japanese banks will face intensified competition as a result of the deregulation.
""I hope Japanese financial institutions will be well prepared for severe competition in the future,"" he said.
Tight regulation, dating back to the end of World War Two, has protected Japanese banks from competition and has made them less efficient than Western rivals, analysts say.
And because of that, some analysts such as Shinji Okabe, senior credit officer at rating agency Moody's Japan, are pessimistic about the future of Japanese banks.
""It seems to me that Japanese banks cannot judge which business is profitable... It looks like the banks all think they can do everything with unlimited resources,"" he said.
Since the early 1990s, Japanese banks have written off problem loans resulting from their adventurous lending policies in the late 1980 ""bubble economy"" of inflated asset prices.
But as of the end of September, 20 major banks were still carrying 23 trillion yen ($201 billion) worth of problem loans.
Analysts say it will take two more years on average for the top 20 banks to cut the loans to manageable levels, giving foreign banks further chances to to nudge into the market.
""Foreign banks have expanded and strengthened their business base in the past decade, but Japanese banks were not able to do anything because they had to dispose of the problem loans,"" said IBCA's Ozeki.
Japan's 20 biggest banks, down from 21 after a merger in April between Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, posted 22.85 trillion yen ($200 billion) in parent operating profits in an eight-year period to the end of March this year.
During that time they also disposed of 21.7 trillion yen ($190 billion) in problem loans, Ozeki said.
Even profitability at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which many analysts agree is the strongest Japanese candidate to become an internationally competitive bank, is low.
The bank's return on equity, a gauge to show the efficiency of the use of capital, is only about 7.2 percent, compared with Barclays Plc's 13.09 percent and Bankers Trust's 18.32 percent, an IBCA study showed.
Analysts say they expect more bank failures in Japan, particularly among smaller regional banks and credit unions.
In November, Japanese authorities ordered the regional Hanwa Bank to halt business, the third regional bank failure since the end of World War Two. Eleven smaller credit unions and associations have also gone under since December 1994.
Analysts said uncertainty over how to deal with troubled banks has not been entirely removed in Japan, and there remains some concern that larger and stronger banks may be drawn into the support mechanism at some cost to themselves.
Japanese banks to which Moody's has given a bank financial strength rating (BFSR) of ""E"" are financially weak, Okabe said.
Chuo Trust &amp; Banking and Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank are the E rated banks.
""There are no U.S. banks which received an E rating. Banks with E ratings are those which have been supported (in Japan's regulated system) despite their inefficiency,"" he said. ($1=114 yen)

10,"The tentative deal with the United States to open Japan's insurance market will create some convulsions in the industry, but will help pave the way for the financial sector deregulation both sides say is vital.
A basic agreement was reached on Saturday, ending a dispute that U.S. President Bill Clinton had called the biggest trade barrier between the two nations.
While it focuses on such esoteric issues as who can sell cancer healthcare policies and whether auto insurance can be purchased through the mail, the issue had become a major political dispute.
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher even got in on the act, calling his Japanese counterpart to apply some last-minute pressure ahead of the Sunday deadline, and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he was relieved that the whole thing was over.
Insurance trade groups were less than thrilled, however, saying the agreement ignores the needs of consumers and keeps their firms out of some fast-growing parts of the business.
Under the agreement, Japanese companies will be allowed -- in stages -- to enter the niche ""third sector"" that includes cancer, healthcare and accident coverage. This is the area where foreign firms have gained a foothold.
Foreign firms are expected to benefit from a deregulation of rates in the non-life insurance sector, including fire and auto insurance, to take place by the end of 1998.
Analysts say that even without the U.S. pressure, the changes were coming as part of Hashimoto's drive to revitalise Japan's financial sector.
""It was a matter of when,"" said Kouya Hasegawa, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.
He said that as with most deregulation, smaller firms will find it tougher to compete in the new world.
""The liberalisation of premiums is a major blow to the non-life insurance industry, particularly medium- to small-sized firms,"" Hasegawa said
Takehito Yamanaka, an analyst at SBC Warburg (Japan) Ltd, agreed: ""It is inevitable that non-life insurers will compete by cutting premiums.""
Medium and small insurers must streamline their network of sales agents to cut costs, he said.
It was not until October that Tokyo removed a ban on mail-order auto insurance under U.S. pressure. Without a network of agents, insurance by mail was seen as an important step for foreign firms.
Income from auto insurance policies account for 40 percent to 50 percent of income at non-life insurance companies, analysts say.
Last month, American Home Assurance Co announced plans for what it says will be Japan's first mail-order car insurance service.
Analysts said the liberalisation of the premiums would eventually result in the disappearance of some financially weak firms and an increase in mergers.
To cope with deregulation, major non-life insurance firm Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Co Ltd recently announced it would take a majority stake in the Japanese unit of U.S. life insurance giant CIGNA Corp within the next year or two, the first time a Japanese non-life insurer has purchased a life insurance operation.
Under Japan's new Insurance Business Law, which took effect on April 1, non-life and life insurers were allowed to enter each other's business sectors for the first time.
Some in the industry argue that deregulation could create huge problems. They say that higher rates will lead to more uninsured drivers and jeopardise the protection of accident victims.
But no one is predicting that the concerns will stop a deregulation drive across the financial sector that comes to Japan a decade after it hit most industrialised nations.

10,"Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities, posted a hefty half-year loss on Tuesday but other ""Big Four"" brokers turned in handsome profits due to improving business on the nation's stock market.
Nomura suffered a net parent loss of around $3 billion in the six months to September 30 after ploughing large amounts of money into helping an ailing finance firm in the Nomura group.
However, the three other big brokers posted healthy profits generally in line with their performance for the same period last year, helped by rising turnover on the Japanese stock market. The brokers have troubled affiliates too but have yet to work out detailed strategies for tackling the problem.
Executives at Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities all said their firms had benefited from increased stockbroking fees and commission income from bond and stock underwriting.
Despite the net losses, analysts said Nomura was on track for better-than-expected profits this year, which would make it easier to resolve financial woes in the Nomura Group.
In the first half, Nomura's parent current profit stood at 69.87 billion yen ($618 million), more than double its 32.16 billion yen ($284 million) first-half profit a year earlier.
However, it reported a loss of 337.54 billion yen ($2.98 billion) on a net basis after providing financial support worth 371 billion yen ($3.28 billion) to the non-bank affiliate.
Parent current profit is pre-tax, and includes losses and gains on non-operating activities. Net profit is after-tax and includes extraordinary profits or losses.
Nomura's Vice President Atsushi Saito said there were no complaints from customers and shareholders about its decision to support the affiliate. Credit rating agencies have been positive about the decision as it shows a willingness to confront the problem, he said.
Nomura wants to boost its operating profits for the latter half of 1996/97 to offset the half-year net loss, he added.
Meanwhile, Hiromitsu Sogame, vice president of Japan's second-biggest broker Daiwa, said that the company wants to provide support to its non-bank affiliate in the current business year on a lump-sum basis and was working on a plan with tax officials and accountants.
In the first half, Daiwa's parent current profit rose 3.7 percent to 28.55 billion yen ($252 million). It was also in profit on a net basis. Sogame said the affiliate needs to write off more than 100 billion yen ($884 million) worth of bad assets and Daiwa will use profits from sales of shareholdings, internal reserves and current profits to provide the aid.
Masao Yuki, the vice president of third biggest broker Nikko, said the company was also considering financial support to several non-bank affiliates. However, he said one of the troubled units was jointly owned by Asahi Bank and it would take time to work out a plan.
Ryuji Shirai, deputy president at Yamaichi Securities, said his firm is expected to revise an existing restructuring plan for its non-bank financial affiliate to cut the period covered by the scheme from the current 10 years.
Nikko's parent current profits fell slightly to 22.23 billion yen ($196 million) in the first half from 25.53 billion yen ($225 million) in the year-earlier period.
Parent current profits at Yamaichi, the last of the ""Big Four"", rose 23 percent to 6.44 billion yen ($56.9 million) in the April-September period. Its net profit also rose.
Nomura and Daiwa did not give earnings forecasts but Nikko said that it expected a parent current profit of 60 billion yen ($530 million) in 1996/97, and Yamaichi said it projected a profit totalling 19 billion yen ($168 million).
"
10,"Two out of Japan's ""Big Four"" brokers, Nomura Securities and Daiwa Securities, are expected to regain their financial health in the current business year, analysts said on Friday.
Japan's second-biggest broker Daiwa Securities said on Friday that it was considering a restructuring programme for a non-bank affiliate.
While details have yet to be decided, analysts said it would not be surprising if Daiwa announces financial aid later in the 1996/97 business year ending in March.
""We expect Daiwa to post a parent current profit of 67 billion yen ($598 million) in 1996/97 if daily average turnover on the Tokyo exchange hits 430 billion yen ($3.83 billion) and if it does not give any support,"" said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities.
Problem loans held by Daiwa's non-bank affiliate are estimated to total 100 billion yen ($892 million) to 150 billion yen ($1.33 billion), and even if the broker decides to help its affiliate write off problem loans in 1996/97, it would have no major impact on Daiwa's financial health, she said.
The ""Big Four"", including Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, are scheduled to announce their business results on Tuesday for the first half of the fiscal year to September 30.
Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Friday that Daiwa was likely to post flat parent net profits in 1996/97 as it has basically decided to provide financial support of about 100 billion yen ($892 million) to a non-bank affiliate.
Daiwa was expected to post a parent current profit of 50 billion yen ($446 million) for 1996/97 and an extraordinary profit of about 50 billion yen ($446 million) from sales of shares, offsetting the special loss stemming from the financial support, the paper said.
In the year ended March 31, 1996, Daiwa posted a parent net profit of 43.69 billion yen ($390 million).
The broker did not issue a profit forecast.
Last month, Nomura said it would provide financial support to its ailing affiliate and post a special loss of 371 billion yen ($3.31 billion) in the half year to September 30.
Nomura said it would post a net loss for the first half because of the special loss, but declined to give an earnings forecast for the half-year and the full year.
However, analysts were unsure whether the other two, Nikko and Yamaichi, which face similar financial problems at their non-bank affiliates, would take action in 1996/97.
A Nikko spokesman said on Friday that the company was considering measures to help its financial affiliates, but no decision had been made.
Ryuji Shirai, deputy president at Yamaichi Securities, said earlier this month that the firm has been reviewing the 10-year programme it launched three years ago to help restructure its non-bank affiliate, and may shorten that period.
UBS's Sato said that it may be difficult for Nikko to quickly decide any course of action for its non-bank affiliates as one of Nikko group's non-bank affiliates is jointly owned by Asahi Bank and its group companies.
Yamaichi's relatively weak capital base compared with the three other big brokers may make it difficult to provide financial aid to its non-bank affiliate in 1996/97, analysts also said.
Nikko projected a parent net profit of nine billion yen ($80.3 million) for the first half and 24 billion yen ($214 million) for the full 1996/97 year.
Yamaichi expected a parent net profit for the half-year of five billion yen ($44.6 million) and for the full year of 16 billion yen ($142 million). ($1=112 yen)

10,"A loan-collecting body said on Tuesday it was seeking the involuntary bankruptcy of a major real estate firm, the latest shock to the country's financial system from the long-running ""jusen"" mortgage firm scandal.
If Osaka-based Sueno Kosan were declared bankrupt it would be one of the biggest Japanese business failures on record, financial industry sources said. The firm has estimated total liabilities of 670 billion yen ($5.87 billion).
The sources said the bankruptcy could lead to problems at financial firms that have loaned money to Sueno Kosan.
The bankruptcy request was made to the Osaka District Court by the semi-governmental Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC), set up to collect problem loans run up by the ""jusen"" group of home loan firms.
Sueno Kosan is a major borrower from the ""jusen"" mortgage firms, which collapsed under the weight of rash property loans made during the ""bubble"" economy of the 1980s.
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo also said the Sueno Kosan problem was likely to spread to financial firms that had lent it money. ""However, such an impact will be resolved among related financial institutions in accordance with our financial system,"" he said.
Jitters about problems in the banking industry helped push up the price of Japanese government bonds to record levels on Tuesday.
The filing was somewhat expected. Kohei Nakabo, president of the HLAC, told reporters recently the body was considering taking such action.
Japanese media reported recently that the corporation was considering such a move because of alleged attempts to transfer Sueno Kosan assets to affiliates.
In September, Sueno Kosan chief Kenichi Sueno pleaded guilty in the Osaka District Court to charges that he and some aides hid assets to prevent them being seized by creditors.
The Sueno group was the second-largest borrower from the mortgage firms.
Media reports have said it borrowed 236.7 billion yen ($2.07 billion) from five of the seven jusen and about 300 billion yen ($2.63 billion) from 10 other financial institutions.
Noboru Matsuda, governor of the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC), which supervises the loan-collecting body, said in a statement that DIC has no intention of seeking the bankruptcy of every borrower from the jusen firms.
But he said that taking such action would be inevitable for some ""malignant"" borrowers like Sueno which he said had repeatedly attempted to hide assets.
Sueno Kosan officials were not immediately able to comment.
Japan's financial industry has made progress in tackling the problem of bubble-era loans gone bad, but analysts say some smaller loan institutions heavily exposed to the real estate and construction industries remain vulnerable.
The collapse of a major financing company last month, Nichiei Finance Co Ltd, with huge debt liabilities also highlighted the continuing fallout from the bad loan problem. ($1=114 yen)

10,"Japan faces a number of regional bank failures over the next few years but the nation's financial system should not suffer any major damage, a leading U.S. rating agency said on Tuesday.
Senior executives from Standard &amp; Poors Corp said weaker Japanese regional banks will go to the wall as liberalisation triggers a shake-out in the Japanese financial sector.
They were speaking to reporters after the agency issued ratings on a small number of top Japanese regional banks, which were mostly judged to be a reasonably safe investment.
""We will see some (Japanese) regional bank failures,"" Ernest Napier, an S&amp;P director, told a news conference.
But he said that as long as the process was well-managed, the failures should not cause a crisis of confidence in the financial system.
The credibility of Japan's debt-burdened finance industry has been rocked by a string of banking failures, including the forced closure last month of Hanwa Bank, a second-tier regional bank based in western Japan.
Naoko Nemoto, an associate director at S&amp;P, said it would be hard for some other second-tier regional banks to stay afloat. While some of Japan's top regional banks enjoy higher credit ratings than big commercial banks, smaller regional banks continue to be plagued by poor asset quality and structural problems, she said.
When Japanese authorities stepped in to close Hanwa, it was the first such forced halt of a bank's operations since World War Two, and only the third bank failure since then -- although several small credit unions have folded.
At the time, the authorities said such swift action was essential for the recovery of the financial system.
Nemoto said that this could become a standard method of dealing with future bank failures.
Japan's other two post-war bank failures were dealt with by creating new bodies to take over their business.
James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan), echoed the S&amp;P view. Second-tier regional banks are likely to be at the sharp end of industry restructuring in the next few years, he said.
""We believe that there are a number of other 'tier two' banks that appear to be equally shaky (as Hanwa),"" he said.
However, the Finance Ministry is honouring a promise it made a year ago to intervene at an earlier stage to close down poorly managed financial institutions, he added.
To meet strong capital market interest in financial institutions, S&amp;P gave public information (pi) ratings to seven first tier regional banks on Tuesday. These are unsolicited credit ratings based on information available to the public rather than lengthy consultations with the issuer.
S&amp;P plans to rate more Japanese banks on a ""pi"" basis, including some of the nation's 20 biggest banks and second-tier regional banks, over the coming months.
Of the seven regional banks given ""pi"" ratings by S&amp;P, Kiyo Bank Ltd got the lowest rating of BBpi while Hachijuni Bank Ltd got the highest at Api. BBBpi ratings were given to five regional banks -- Bank of Yokohama Ltd, Hyakujushi Bank Ltd, Iyo Bank Ltd, Nanto Bank Ltd and Suruga Bank Ltd.
Ratings in the ""AAA"", ""AA"", ""A"" and ""BBB"" categories are considered investment grade, while the ""BB"" category is regarded as having speculative characteristics.
"
10,"Faced with persistent market rumours that it is on the verge of collapse, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd went public on Wednesday to say that any such talk is ""totally groundless"".
""In the markets, unsourced rumours such as the suggestion that our bank is practically on the verge of collapse are circulating and are prompting sales of our shares and debentures,"" NCB vice president Shoji Nishikawa told a hastily convened news conference.
""Such rumours are totally groundless and our bank would like to declare that these rumours are not true,"" he said.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka also came out in support of long-suffering Nippon Credit, whose failure could spark a crisis in the banking industry.
He said the government will fully support the bank, although he added that the ministry is not worried about the financial health of Nippon Credit, the smallest of the nation's three long-term credit banks.
""The ministry has had no worries about the bank. It (the bank) is doing its utmost to improve its management. We don't believe that the bank will collapse as some media reports have said,"" Mitsuzuka told reporters at his regular news conference.
Nippon Credit's latest ordeal began early Wednesday when traders began to sell its shares on vague talk that NCB would hold an emergency news conference. There was also a vague rumour about a possible merger involving NCB, they said.
The dumping of the bank's shares ignited renewed selling throughout the banking sector. The sharp fall in banking shares has been largely to blame for the tumble in the Tokyo stock market since mid-December.
Nippon Credit shares fell 35 yen (28 cents) to close on Wednesday at an all-time low of 181 yen ($1.47).
In the bond market, NCB's latest debentures are selling at a yield of 4.1 percent, a full 2.5 percentage points above bonds issued by other banks, reflecting the perceived risk in its debts.
Nishikawa said the sell-off was influenced by exaggerated media reports which hyped concerns over the health of Japan's financial system.
""We believe the market condition has deviated greatly from the realities of the bank. We hope market participants will calm down,"" he said.
He also said the bank would be able to post a current profit in 1996/97 even after disposing of problem loans as it had planned -- if Tokyo stock prices remain at their current levels.
Like other banks, NCB relies on its own share holdings to help provide needed cash so as the stock market tumbles, its situation worsens. That has created a vicious circle for the Tokyo stock market.
The bank plans to write off problem loans of 130 billion yen ($1.05 billion) in the current fiscal year ending March 31. As of the end of September, such problem loans totalled 1.39 trillion yen ($11.3 billion).
Some analysts said that it is unclear whether the news conference by NCB and the finance ministry's pledge to support the bank would help regain confidence in Japan's banking sector.
""In the long-term, the banking sector will remain under pressure until Japan completes its 'Big Bang' financial reforms,"" said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre. ($1=123 yen)
"
10,"A bill to lift a 50-year-old ban on holding companies is expected to be submitted to Japan's next parliament, with passage almost assured because of the government's ""Big Bang"" deregulation plans, economists say.
They added the financial industry would likely be the one which benefits first as the lifting of the ban would help it restructure and bail out troubled financial institutions.
Political haggling has delayed a decision on the holding companies ban for almost a year.
But the economists said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's plans to liberalise the financial markets by 2001 and the proposed breakup of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) mean the ban will likely be lifted.
A holding company is a firm which controls one or more companies, often by having a majority of shares in them, but does not engage in a specific business.
Big business has demanded for years that the ban be lifted, and the pressure on the government has increased recently as many companies push for deregulation to help them streamline and compete with overseas rivals.
The plan to break up NTT calls for it to be restructured into three firms under a holding company. The firm had resisted the break-up plans until the holding company option was offered.
U.S. occupation forces introduced the ban on holding companies in 1947 to break up powerful conglomerates, known as ""zaibatsu"", which the United States said had contributed to Japan's war effort.
""I am sure the ban will be relaxed broadly in line with ideas the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been advocating,"" said Hideo Fujiwara, senior research fellow at LTCB Research Institute Inc.
The Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the anti-monopoly watchdog, said last week it plans to submit a bill to end the ban to the session of parliament which starts in January.
Last January, the FTC sought to revise the Anti-Monopoly Law to broadly remove the ban, which had the backing of the pro-business LDP.
But that failed when the Social Democratic Party, a member in the then-ruling coalition, called for only a partial lifting of the ban.
If the bill passes next year, the ban would be relaxed by October 1997 at the earliest.
""Even if the ban is lifted, not many companies will make use of the new corporate structure immediately,"" Fujiwara said.
Companies such as Sony Corp, Canon Inc and Asahi Glass Co Ltd may be able to establish holding companies as they have already split their operations, he said, but many other companies have not.
But financial companies are in a better position to take advantage of the change, some economists said.
""Holding companies will enable banks, brokers and insurers to break down barriers between them,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, a first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc.
Ikuyo said a holding company would make it easy for a big financial institution to streamline its corporate group, in particular, bailing out an ailing financial firm in the group.
The economists also said regional banks which tie up under a holding company would be able to boost their coverage areas.
Some warn, however, that financial holding companies would not solve all the problems facing the financial industry, in which too many deposit-taking institutions are competing.
""Like the recently collapsed Hanwa Bank, not all failed financial institutions can be bailed out through a holding company,"" LTCB Research's Fujiwara said.
The Finance Ministry last month suspended most operations at Hanwa and will eventually wind down the regional bank, which collapsed under the weight of its problem loans.
"
10,"The vulnerability of Japan's banking sector shares to rumour-led selloffs shows that investor confidence in the sector is still thin, brokers and analysts said on Wednesday.
Bank shares tumbled after vague market talk, later denied, that Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) would hold an emergency news conference reignited worries about Japan's financial system, they said.
""We cannot say that the negative trend in the banking sector has finished,"" Masaaki Higashida, a strategist at Nomura Securities, said. ""Markets are still sensitive about rumours, and this shows that investors remain concerned about the financial health of banks,"" he said.  
It was hard to predict how far bank shares will fall, analysts said, adding that there are no quick remedies to regain the lost confidence in the sector aside from improving asset quality by disposing of problem loans.
Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said: ""In the long-term, the banking sector may remain under pressure until Japan completes its Big Bang financial reforms.""
""It is also difficult to become positive on the sector near-term, particularly if looking at interest rate prospects,"" he said, adding that interest rates have nowhere to go but up, as they have already fallen to a historically low level.  
Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said that the market's view of banks' financial health may further erode because land prices remain under pressure and this has cast doubts over the economic recovery.
""Financially weak banks must try harder to regain the confidence from investors by cutting non-performing loans and less-profitable assets,"" another analyst said.
One bright factor which may emerge is a move within parliament by some opposition politicians calling for the use of fresh public money to deal with problem loan issue, analysts and brokers said.
""If a system to use public money to bail out big banks is established, it will ease the nerves in the stock market and selective buying of strong banks will emerge,"" a market source said.
Last month, Moody's Investor Service lowered its ratings outlook for NCB and three other Japanese banks -- Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd, Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Ltd and Chuo Trust and Banking -- to negative from stable.
It attributed the downgrading to serious asset quality problems, and said that their respective earnings, existing capital and reserves might not provide a sufficient cushion to absorb new loan-loss provisions.
"
11,"China is expected to end the year without loosening its three-year old tight credit policy as rampant local fixed asset investment continues to threaten economic over-heating, analysts said on Thursday.
Earlier this year, China seemed poised to modify the austerity measures, but a surge in fixed asset projects since July has led Beijing to change its mind, they said.
In the latest high-level clue to credit policy, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was quoted by the official media on Thursday as saying there was a need to strictly control new fixed asset investment projects.
""There is the need to continue to curb inflation and strictly control new industrial projects,"" Zhu was quoted as saying during a recent visit to the eastern coastal province of Fujian.
The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, on Wednesday also criticised a rush by provinces to invest in high-profile industries, citing 22 provinces that had listed car production as one of their key industries.
""There is still the threat of a resurgence of inflation and of the economy over-heating with fixed asset investment climbing again since the central bank cut bank interest rates earlier this year,"" said a Beijing-based official with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
Growth in retail price inflation is expected to slow to six percent year on year in 1996 against 14.8 percent last year.
Official figures show that local governments around the country have allowed 700 new fixed asset investments since July.
China's State Planning Commission estimates that fixed asset investment will hit 2.3 trillion yuan ($277.1 billion) this year, about three times the level of 1992.
""The resurgence of fixed asset investment in the second half of this year seems to have made the central bank more cautious about loosening credit,"" a banker with the Bank of China said. ""The most important signal is that the much-discussed bank reserve ratio cut now seems to be off the near-term agenda.""
In mid-July, Dai Xianglong, president of the People's Bank of China, said the central bank would shortly cut bank reserve ratios by a margin possibly as large as three percent. This would release huge amounts of money into the market.
Chinese banks and other financial institutions are required to place 13 percent of their deposits with the central bank and keep another five to seven percent themselves as reserves.
Between July and October, central bank officials talked frequently about cutting the bank ratios, which were set eight years ago and have never been changed.
""But now they are focusing on the need to continue the austerity measures,"" said an analyst with the Communications Bank of China. ""The main concern is the large amount of money in the system beyond the direct control of the central bank.""
China's central bank has direct control of the four major state banks -- the ICBC, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China.
Credit supplied by the four banks once accounted for more than 90 percent of total loans but this proportion has now shrunk to around 70 percent and is still falling.
Analysts said the impact from a cut in bank reserve ratio could be balanced by other policy controls such as the credit quota system.
But the bulk of money liberated from other banks and financial institutions would inevitably enter the markets with the central bank being unable to directly intervene.

11,"China issued another strong signal on Sunday that its stock and bond markets have been given the green light for fast growth to provide the economy with more efficient means of investment.
The official Shanghai Securities News said the stock and bond markets must be developed vigorously to provide a stronger foundation for national economic development.
The newspaper quoted a report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a think-tank, as saying the efficiency of investment channels was a key question affecting the long-term development of China's economy.
""The sluggish development of the direct investment markets is one of the factors affecting the long-term development of the national economy, so it is necessary to speed up the development of stocks, bonds and other direct investment markets,"" it said.
The report was the latest in a series of indications that Beijing's previous suspicion of the securities markets has been replaced by a determination to expand and strengthen them.
It said more direct investment would help to reduce the tangle of problems surrounding heavily indebted state enterprises and the state banks that are currently forced to support the enterprises with a constant supply of loans.
""Banks are being squeezed from both sides, given the high risk (of loans to state enterprises) and the ever-growing deposits they are taking in,"" the paper said.
It said that it would be better for all parties if depositors put less cash into bank deposits and invested it directly in companies through the securities markets.
""Most of the money in the hands of ordinary people is currently put into bank accounts, which increases total bank deposits even as enterprises are short of money, resulting in capital being left idle and wasted,"" the report said.
The current small scale of the direct investment markets was a key reason for this imbalance, it said.
""So how to standardise, develop and strengthen the direct investment markets to allow for more reasonable usage of deposits is an important part of raising the efficiency of banks and making more efficient use of capital,"" it added.
The report gave no details on shifting the focus of enterprise investment from banks loans to securities, but Beijing has implemented a number of measures recently aimed at expanding the securities markets.
A record number of companies have this year been given approval to list shares on the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
The Shenzhen market was strongly affected last week by rumours, denied in Beijing, that securities authorities were about to release the quotas for company listings for next year.
But authorities last week did announce a major relaxation of policy on mutual funds, which are seen as an important conduit for funnelling funds from ordinary people into the securities markets.
Regulations allowing existing mutual funds to list on the stock exchanges are due to be released before the end of the year, official media reports said.
"
11,"China's top securities watchdog on Monday issued new requirements for exchanges and securities houses to strengthen risk control with the aim of cooling its over-heated domestic A share markets.
But the markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen responded with fresh rises in active trading with the A share indices hitting new 1996 highs, and analysts said the warnings would have little impact on the current active trading.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), in a circular, ordered the two stock exchanges to investigate the risk control mechanisms of their members, the Shanghai Securities News reported.
All securities houses must now display in their business halls warnings about the risks of trading on the stock markets, the circular said.
""The exchanges must quickly organise several groups to investigate the risk control systems of their members and report the results to the CSRC,"" it said.
It also ordered designated newspapers and magazines to report more on the risks of stock investment.
""Any comments on stock markets must avoid encouraging speculation in order to prevent investors being misguided,"" it added.
The new instructions follow dramatic surges on the domestic A share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen this year.
Beijing announced a new positive policy towards the stock markets in April, and since then Shanghai's A share market has risen more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart more than 250 percent.
By the end of November, China had 20 million retail investors in stocks, double the number at the end of 1995, according to media reports.
""The central government is concerned about surges on the markets which might be out of control,"" said Yuan Ji, an A share trader with China Guotai Securities. ""It hopes the markets will rise more steadily.""
The surges apparently have been beyond the expectations of the securities authorities and, to cool the over-heated markets, the CSRC has over the past few weeks issued a series of new rules and punished many brokerages for irregularities.
But, despite the fresh warnings, Shanghai's A share index hit a new 1996 high of 1,312.295 points in the morning session on Monday and its Shenzhen counterpart a high of 486.22.
""Investors believe the authorities do not want to depress the markets, but are just worried over prices rising too fast,"" said a trader with a major Chinese brokerage. ""Because of this belief, the new warnings will have only a slight impact.""
The CSRC in the circular also ordered local securities authorities to ensure the securities institutions have displayed the information by January.
"
11,"China's domestic A shares continued to plummet on Thursday with investor confidence still in tatters following the rude shock of a government crackdown on the markets on Monday, traders said.
Shanghai's foreign currency B share index ended little changed at 64.343 points with bargain-hunting support prices, but A shares on the market fell 7.54 percent to 940.548.
On the Shenzhen stock market next to Hong Kong, the A share index plunged 8.7 percent to 357.85 points, while the B shares were also down sharply, losing 5.42 percent to 126.54 points.
""A growing number of investors want to leave the A and B markets, at least for a while,"" a Shenzhen trader said.
Brokers said Shanghai A shares plunged on unstable market sentiment and reported seeing some panic selling on rumours that more negative market news could be announced at the weekend.
""Retail investors used the opportunity of a technical rebound on Wednesday to offset their positions,"" said one broker. ""Sentiment is still weak.""
The Shanghai B share market is looking the healthiest of the China share markets in the wake of the crackdown in which the Beijing authorities said stock trading was overheated and warned of a crash if speculative trading was not stopped.
""Technical charts show the B share index is likely to consolidate between 63 and 65 points in the short term with investors targeting stocks with strong profits records,"" a second broker said.
Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere was the star on expectation of good results, rising $0.052 or 9.84 percent to $0.580, on volume of 1.7 million shares.
Shanghai Tyre &amp; Rubber followed on institutional buying, up $0.034 or 8.21 percent to $0.448, on volume of 1.2 million shares.
In Shenzhen, brokers said the market was hit by institutions taking profits on the B share market with investors still jittery over Beijing's crackdown.
""Investors offset their positions whenever prices rose because they have little confidence in the market's short-term outlook after the falls earlier this week,"" an analyst said.
Many Shanghai B shares closed at the 10 percent limit-down with Dadonghai falling HK$0.36 to HK$3.20 on volume of 5.84 million shares on institutional selling, brokers said.
Changan Automobile traded the most on volume of 11.86 million shares, losing HK$0.20 to HK$3.55.
The A market plummeted with the majority of A shares closing at the 10 percent limit-down due to heavy selling in ""rubbish stocks"" -- shares of smaller firms with poor business results over the past few years, brokers said.
One Shenzhen broker predicted that the A shares could have a long way further to fall given their strong gains in the past few months.
But several Shenzhen counters with strong earnings records were seen being supported by institutional demand, brokers said.
Guangdong Power's A shares rose 0.93 yuan or 5.72 percent to 13.49 yuan, with its B shares up HK$0.35 or 6.36 percent to HK$5.85 per share, making them the best performers on the city's A and B share markets on Thursday.
"
11,"The Chinese authorities acted decisively on Friday to stop extraordinary price movements on the country's two stock markets by imposing a limit of 10 percent in the movement of any stock on one day.
In announcements made after the market closed on Friday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange set daily movement limits for all shares and investment fund units at 10 percent in either direction, with effect from next Monday.
""From Monday on, all bids and asks exceeding the limits are null and void,"" the announcement said. ""No brokerage must accept invalid bids and asks.""
The announcements followed several days of dramatic falls in the B share indices of both Shanghai and Shenzhen, which on Friday alone plunged 12.26 percent and 14.75 percent respectively.
On Friday, the exchanges also ordered brokerages to make public the top losing and gaining stocks on any one day and the names of the key institutions involved in trading.
Brokers said the order would tend to limit institutional speculation, adding that while restriction of market manipulation was good, the move would also hinder the activity of the markets.
The announcements all made clear that they had been approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which supervises all securities and futures markets.
Chinese brokers generally welcomed the new limits, saying they would effectively help control erratic trading on the fledging markets founded in 1990.
""The decisions indicate the securities authorities are determined to standardise the markets and will be a key step in stabilising share prices,"" said Xu Zhiling, deputy general manager of the securities trading department of China Guotai Securities.
But some brokers said setting the limits would benefit buyers and help creating buyers' markets.
""Unlike futures contracts, investors cannot build short positions on the stock markets,"" said one broker. ""Price limits thus will help buyers who can build large positions without much risk of price plunges.""
A foreign broker in Shanghai said the limits were overall not beneficial to the market or its development.
""Trading limits generally distort markets rather than rationalise trading,"" he said. ""But the real question is how long can this can go on.""
Shanghai's B share index ended down 9.267 points or 12.26 percent at 66.291 points on Friday on fears that Beijing would crack down on domestic investors trading B shares, traders said.
The fears were sparked by news reports that the securities authorities in Shenzhen had ordered local brokerages not to accept foreign exchange to buy B shares from local people unless they could prove the money originated from outside China, they said.
Shanghai's A share index lost 67.781 points or 5.51 percent to 1,163.050 on news that checks had begun in some parts of China on the risk management systems of securities brokerages.
Meanwhile, Shenzhen's B share index plunged 25.85 points or 14.75 percent to end at 149.37 in heavy trading because of the crackdown by local securities authorities on mainland Chinese buying B shares, brokers said.
The Shenzhen A share index lost 23.60 points, or 4.84 percent, to 463.81 on turnover of 9.26 billion yuan compared with 14.24 billion on Thursday.

11,"A sudden crackdown on China's fledging stock markets pushed most shares to limit-down levels on Monday and triggered an outcry from securities brokerages and retail investors.
The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, said in a commentary on Monday that the country's stock markets had overheated on widespread speculation and warned that Beijing would not step in to help if the stock markets plunged.
Virtually all shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets fell 10 percent, the daily limit announced by the authorities last Friday afternoon to prevent sharp fluctuations.
""This is very, very disappointing and outrageous,"" said one local stock analyst. ""With this simple decision they can wipe out nearly all the gains in the securities business in a hard year.""
""I can't understand it,"" said a trader. ""Such administrative edicts will eventually kill the markets one day.""
Analysts said they were shocked by the sudden change of direction by officials in Beijing.
Since April there have been many official statements, messages and hints indicating clearly that the stock markets had the official blessing of Beijing.
China's foreign currency B share market in Shanghai soared by about 80 percent between November 11 and December 10 while the bourse in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen rose by about 100 percent before sharp falls in the final days of last week.
Shanghai's A share index had surged more than 100 percent and Shenzhen's A share index nearly 300 percent since April.
""They had been talking about encouraging stock invesment and suddenly here comes the new policy,"" said a retail investor. ""Most of us will have our money caught in the markets. It looks like prices will plunge and no one wants to buy.""
Foreign brokers and analysts also slammed the sudden official intervention, saying it went counter to the trend in China of gradually allowing market forces and controls to play a greater role.
""Foreign investors will not welcome such administrative interference in the markets,"" said a Shanghai-based brokerage analyst. ""What is worse is that it seems from the People's Daily editorial that they wanted to force prices down.""
Shanghai's domestic A share index plunged 9.92 percent to 1,047.680 points and the foreign currency B shares fell 9.6 percent to 59.929 points.
In Shenzhen, the B share index dived 10 percent to 134.43, and the A share index also 10 percent to 417.20.
Brokers and analysts said they expected another 10 percent limit-down day for the markets on Tuesday, with virtually no buyers in sight, and a great sense of unease amongst investors about how quickly the market can be turned by officials edicts.
""For Shanghai B shares, tomorrow will be another 10 percent, but on the third day it may be less,"" said another foreign brokerage analyst. ""Buying interest is very limited.""
""Panic selling occurred in many securities trading halls in major brokerages,"" said one trader. ""But nobody wants to buy. Investors believe current prices are very high taking into account the changed market fundamentals after the crackdown.""
A second trader said market confidence was destroyed. ""We can see no support for the time being,"" he said. The B index is likely to head for a historical low at around 45 points shortly.""
In Shenzhen, local brokers said most Shenzhen-listed stocks were likely to register limit-down closes over the next few sessions as investors have been intimidated by the People's Daily commentary.
""They could have adopted other measures such as an effective ban on widespread illicit trading by institutional punters to cap share prices,"" a Shenzhen trader complained. ""Instead, this method sacrifices many innocent, small investors.""
Many investors, including institutions, were sitting on heavy losses on today's fall and investor confidence was unlikely to recover over the short term, brokers said.

11,"China's Shanghai Pudong Development Bank will rent the former headquarters of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, the most impressive building on the city's waterfront Bund, an official said on Tuesday.
The official said a signing ceremony would be held on Thursday in the grand main hall of the building, opened in 1925 as a symbol of the financial might of the British Empire.
""The building will be leased to the Pudong Development Bank,"" said the official with the Shanghai city government office set up to find new tenants for the old banks and trading houses along the Bund.
The Pudong Development Bank is a state-owned Chinese bank based in the Pudong Development Zone, across the Huangpu River from the Bund. It is majority owned by the bank building's landlord -- the Shanghai city government.
An official with the Pudong bank said they had agreed to a lease of 30 years duration. But he declined to give details of the lease terms for the building, which has a total floorspace of 24,000 square metres.
The general manager of the Bund Buildings Function Transformation Office, Zhou Jinbao, said last month that he believed the property was worth at least $3 per square metre.
A real estate analyst said he felt it was unlikely a Chinese bank, particularly one closely linked to the Shanghai city government, would pay anything close to that figure.
Another businessman said he understood the new tenant would be allowed to sub-let space in the building to other companies.
The lease announcement marks the failure of the city authorities to find a foreign bank that would be willing to lease the most prestigious building in Shanghai.
The building was the main office of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank until the Communist takeover in 1949 and then served as the Shanghai headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party until last year when the city officials moved into a new building.
Since then, the building, with its huge main banking hall featuring magnificent marble pillars and curved glass roof, has been empty.
The Hongkong Bank had more than two years of discussions with Shanghai city officials on terms for resuming control of their former headquarters but finally announced that they had decided not to proceed with the proposal.
Zhou said the Hongkong Bank had wanted to demolish several buildings behind the main structure and erect a modern office tower.
But he said this proposal would have had an impact on the wider development plans for the area which have not yet been fixed and are unlikely to be finalised for at least another year or two.
"
11,"China's financial markets have made significant steps towards maturity in 1996, with Beijing more willing than ever to allow them to gradually take on the mantle of economic control, analysts said on Friday.
But the Chinese securities, futures and money markets, less than six years old and still suffering the volatility of youth, have a long way to go to reach the level of standardisation and stability found in many other Asian countries, they said.
""In the past the central government always used the word 'experimental' when referring to the markets, but this year they instead started saying they are 'in the initial stages of development',"" said a Chinese brokerage analyst.
""This shows that it is more determined than ever before to let the markets survive and develop,"" he said.
Beijing gave its official blessing to the stock markets in April, and since then, the exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen have expanded faster than ever before, adding a total of 178 companies between them so far this year.
Total market capitalisation of the two markets is now 1,271 billion yuan ($153 billion) compared with 350 billion yuan at the start of the year.
The treasury bill market also boomed in 1996 with a record issue of 195.2 billion yuan worth of debt.
An interbank market for local currency, set up in January, has become an indispensible mechanism for banks to swap short-term funds, and has started the process of making interest rates responsive to market forces.
The developments all take China significantly further along the road from the state-planned past towards the market-influenced future.
Analysts said that while the Beijing leadership remains highly cautious about relaxing its controls over the main economic levers, it understands that it must do so eventually.
""The key motive behind the new approach is to gradually relieve the central government of the heavy burden of (the) money-losing state sector,"" said one economist.
""Beijing has urged state enterprises to resort more to market means to develop themselves instead of relying on loans from the state banks.""
But this year, the authorities have also made it very plain that they will not allow rampant irregularities in the markets.
China's futures exchanges, which have largely operated as speculative casinos for years, have been firmly brought to heel over the past year.
The ""hot money"" which until early this year used to shift at lightning speed from Beijing green beans to Hainan plywood and on to Tianjin red beans has been squeezed out of the futures exchanges and shifted into the share markets, analysts said.
In the past month, branches of virtually all of China's top banks, securities houses and financial institutions have also been publicly accused of running illegal securities scams of one kind or another, with fines and warnings liberally dispensed.
""Serious efforts have been made to standardise the market,"" said a treasury bond trader. ""No one, even the influential banks and key securities houses, are exempt from punishment if they breach the rules.""
Analysts said the main shortcoming at the moment is the legal framework for the markets, which consists of a series of overlapping and often contradictory regulations.
The overall Securities Law and Futures Law, which will provide the basis for the future development of the markets, has been trapped in Beijing's bureaucracy for more than three years now with no sign of emerging soon, they said. ($1= 8.3 yuan)
"
11,"China on Monday named the first four foreign banks, based in Shanghai, to be allowed to conduct business in the local Chinese currency, ending months of speculation.
The four banks are the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, Citibank, Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan.
A spokesman for the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said the foreign banks would be allowed to do Chinese currency loans, deposits and some other business.
""The scope of the business was defined in the rules issued recently,"" he said but declined to give further details.
A report from the official Xinhua news agency two weeks ago said the chosen foreign banks would not be allowed to have oustanding local currency loans exceeding 35 percent of their foreign currency loans.
All foreign banks in China are currently restricted to do business in foreign currency and have been eager to gain a share of the huge local market for Chinese yuan deposits and loans.
Foreign banks doing China yuan business would have to adopt the regulations that applied to Chinese financial institutions, Xinhua said.
It did not elaborate, but that appeared to mean foreign banks would have to accept the same tax rate used for Chinese banks -- one of the key obstacles to implementing the policy change.
Foreign bank profits are currently taxed at a 15 percent rate while Chinese commercial banks are taxed at 33 percent and the main state banks at 55 percent.
A foreign banker working with one of the chosen banks said formal confirmation had been received today.
""But there were no details at all, no conditions of business given,"" he said.
A foreign banker with one of the other banks said he had not yet received formal notification.
""There has been no news,"" he said. ""But even after we hear, it will still be at least a month or two before business would start. My impression is it will take quite a while. There are many things to sort out.""
The tax rate issue remains unclear and is still the main obstacle to foreign banks starting up local currency business, he said.
The China manager of Credit Lyonnais, Jacques Bertholier, said he hoped his bank would be included within the second batch of banks to be granted approval to do yuan business, hopefully within a couple of months.
""It is not perfectly clear what the terms of business are, but there appears to be a good scope for activity,"" he said.
"
11,"China is firming up a shortlist of foreign banks that will be allowed to do local renminbi currency business, foreign bankers said on Monday.
Hongkong Bank, Citibank and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi are expected to be among the winners, they said.
Foreign banks with branches in China, currently restricted to doing business in foreign exchange, have been promised that a handful will be given the right to take deposits and make loans in the Chinese currency before the end of the year.
""The Hongkong Bank, Citibank and Bank of Tokyo are in, the Chinese have made that clear,"" said one banker. ""There may also be a European bank and a Hong Kong-based bank added as well, but they may not. They are being very cautious.""
""The decision will be made as always on a geopolitical basis -- one from America, one from Japan, one from Europe,"" said a Hong Kong-based European banker.
Officials from Hongkong Bank and Citibank declined to comment on their chances and Bank of Tokyo executives were not available.
But other bankers said there were still conflicting reports as to when the announcement would be made.
""It has to happen soon,"" said a Shanghai-based banker. ""We've waited far too long. We're all tired and bored with the waiting.""
Once the announcement has been made, foreign bankers said they expected it to offer only very limited renminbi business rights, restricted to taking in money from, and lending money to, foreign-funded enterprises in China.
""The funding problem is the key one,"" said a foreign banker. ""Foreign-funded firms wouldn't generally want to put their renminbi on deposit with a bank, it's their working capital. If they did, it would be an act of charity (towards the banks).""
The foreign banks will definitely not be allowed in the foreseeable future to take in deposits from Chinese firms or individuals, bankers said.
The answer may be that the People's Bank of China, the central bank, will lend renminbi funds to the foreign banks to lend on to customers, thereby giving the central bank power to control the extent of the business, they said.
Once the first batch of banks have begun to do limited renminbi business, it could be as much as a year before any other foreign banks are allowed to join them, bankers said.
""They are being very careful; this will be an experiment that they will watch very closely before taking another step forward,"" said one banker.
"
48,"Sales of light vehicles in December are expected to be down as much as 6 percent from an unusually strong month a year ago, but analysts say the pace was robust enough for 1996's total to match industry projections of 15.1 million units.
General Motors Corp. will endure the largest drop of the Big Three, with the daily sales rate off by an estimated 16 percent from December 1995, according to David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.
GM's sales of pickup trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans -- the light truck category -- will be down significantly, in large part because the automaker is up against a tough comparison from a year ago.
However, car sales will also plunge by as much as 20 percent, estimates Michael Luckey, of Luckey Consulting Group. He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM's labour strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.
""They're still being hurt by the strikes,"" he said. ""I think that's still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December.""
GM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3. Also reporting Friday is Chrysler Corp., whose sales will be flat or up slightly from December a year ago.
Light truck sales, which have been accounting for about 70 percent of Chrysler's total, are projected to rise 8 percent, offsetting an expected 9 percent slide in passenger car sales, said Healy.
Ford Motor Co., scheduled to release its results Jan. 6, will enjoy one of its best year-to-year comparisons since March 1994, said Luckey, with sales rising between 8 percent and 9 percent against a somewhat weak performance in December 1995.
Ford's car sales are forecast to dip 3 percent to 4 percent. Last week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.
""If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that,"" said Luckey.
Ford's light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, he said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport/utility.
Imports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.
""The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars,"" he said.
For December 1996, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.
However, Luckey said the U.S. Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalise the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.
Most analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.
""It should be 15.1 million,"" said Luckey. ""That's almost certain unless something very strange happens in December.""
That total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark. In 1995, total light vehicle sales were 14.7 million, down from 15.1 million for all of 1994.
"
48,"Calling it a crucial change for how it develops new cars and trucks, Ford Motor Co. Wednesday launched a new computer-aided design project based on a computer program from Structural Dynamics Research Corp..
Ford said the new project, called C3P, will cut prototype costs by up to 50 percent; improve investment efficiency by 20 percent to 30 percent; and eliminate half of costly late development changes.
""The new C3P initiative represents the most fundamental change of the engineering computer infrastructure in Ford's history,"" Paul Blumberg, director of product development systems at Ford's Product Development Center, said in a statement.
Officials did not specify any dollar amount savings. But executives said they fall under previously disclosed product development cost savings. Three new vehicle programs started this year will use C3P.
Once the program is fully implemented in 2000, Ford said it will merge computer-aided design, manufacturing and engineering functions into a seamless, unified system encompassing all stages of vehicle and component development.
Ford's decision to team up with Structural Dynamics Research (SDRC) raised eyebrows at competitors. The Milford, Ohio-based firm is a small player in the market of supplying computer aided design and manufacturing systems (CAD/CAM) to the auto industry, according to both competitors and analysts.
""You just don't hear about SDRC,"" said Ron Bienkowski, an executive engineer at Chrysler Corp.
Bienkowski also chided Ford for launching a new design program seven years after Chrysler did.
""We made the decision to go to a single system like C3P back in 1989,"" he said.
Chrysler, as well as several other Japanese and European automakers, use the more popular CATIA program from Paris-based Dassault Systemes and IBM Corp..
Charles Foundyller, president of market research firm Daratech Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., said the SDRC system is an easy-to-use, powerful system that should serve Ford well.
""All in all, I don't think Ford made a bad decision,"" he said.
Ford made the C3P announcement as part of a half-day presentation to reporters touting the No. 2 U.S. automaker's computer capabilities. Among other news items announced Wednesday, Ford:
-- plans to eliminate 90 percent of its physical prototypes by 2000 in favor of electronic versions. Physical prototypes now constitute about 40 percent to 50 percent today;
-- will be able to conduct a computer-simulated frontal crash for $10 in 2000, compared to the $200 it currently costs;
-- will introduce a production car in Europe in 1997 that was designed almost completely using computer technology.
Ford executives were hard-pressed to assign dollar amounts to all of the new computer design and prototype initiatives.
But Claude Lobo, director of advanced design at Ford, said the new systems dramatically improve quality and free designers and engineers to take more risks.
"
48,"Chrysler Corp. Monday said sales rose a scant 1.4 percent in November, a dramatic slowdown for the nation's third-largest automaker and a sign of what analysts said would be a weak month for Detroit's Big Three.
November sales of 179,628, up from 177,073 in November 1995, set a record for the month, and Chrysler's year-to-date sales of 2,271,022 surpassed its previous full-year record of 2,208,057 set in 1988. But the 1.4 percent increase was one of the smallest for Chrysler so far this year.
Chrysler said car sales fell 11 percent based on daily selling rates last month while sales of pickup trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans rose 7 percent.
Chrysler credited a strong performance from its Dodge and Jeep divisions. Dodge sales were 95,022 and Jeep sales reached 42,835, both records for November.
""Our new 1997 lineup continues to generate healthy traffic at our dealerships,"" James Holden, executive vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement.
But Burnham Securities Inc. analyst David Healy said sales to fleet dealers such as car rental agencies fell in November, contributing to the weak performance.
Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to post lower car sales for November, leading to weak overall sales for the No. 1 and No. 2 automakers.
That is expected to drag down the industry's sales by 2 percent to 3 percent, according to Michael Luckey, president of Luckey Consulting Group.
""The car market from what I'm hearing is going to be lousy for just about everybody,"" he said.
Luckey said annual sales based on November's expected performance and government seasonal data would be 14.7 million to 14.8 million units. The rate for October was 14.9 million, and the rate for November 1995 was 14.8 million.
But the actual november sales rate could be 300,000 units below that, he said, because of fluctuations in government data used to compute the rate.
Analysts noted that slower sales were expected for the second half of 1996, but Healy said it was too early to declare a recession for car sales because monthly sales rates can be volatile.
GM, set to report sales on Tuesday, is seen posting a 15 percent drop in overall sales, with car sales down more than 20 percent and light truck sales unchanged.
Car sales were hurt by the three-week Canadian autoworkers' strike in October, which caused a production loss of some 100,000 GM cars. Contributing to the weak numbers were customers who chose to wait for GM's 15 new models instead of buying older versions.
""Certainly for quite awhile their car sales are going to be hurt by these painfully slow transitions to the new models,"" said Luckey, noting it could be next spring before GM has full availability of its new cars.
Healy estimated Ford sales will slide 4 percent to 5 percent. Sales of pickups, minivans and sport/utilities are expected to rise 2 percent, with car sales off 12 percent, he said. Ford is scheduled to announce its sales on Wednesday.
Subaru of America Inc. reported a 21 percent jump in sales to 11,072 from the previous month. Year-to-date sales from Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd of Japan, were 108,533, also up 21 percent from a year ago.
Volvo AB said U.S. sales fell 3.6 percent to 6,582 for November.

48,"A gunman in military fatigues burst into a Ford Motor Co. assembly plant and opened fire Thursday, killing one and wounding two others before eluding police in a series of draininge tunnels.
Police said they trapped the man and he gave up voluntarily after a tense, four and a half-hour standoff.
Sgt. Clarence Goodlein of the Wixom police said the white male shot and killed one Ford employee and wounded another, then left the plant and shot an Oakland County Sheriff's deputy in the shoulder when police tried to confront him.
Goodlein did not identify the victims, but a Ford worker, Jim Maher, said the man killed was a foreman at the plant.
Deputy Matt Miller, 39, was listed in stable condition and was expected to undergo surgery Thursday afternoon, said Amy Middleton, a spokeswoman for Providence Park Medical Center.
The other worker, Alvin Akers, 43, was treated and released, with a bullet fragment in his arm and glass fragments in his neck.
Goodlein said authorities did not immediately know whether the gunman was a Ford employee.
""This guy came into the plant and with some kind of weapon starting shooting all over the place,"" said Ford spokesman Bill Carroll.
Police shut down nearby Interstate 96, which runs parallel to the plant. Workers were evacuated from the plant and production of Lincoln Town Cars, Continentals and Mark VIII luxury cars was suspended until Monday.
Carroll said the gunman opened fire in several sections of the plant before before leaving and shooting in the direction of the nearby Interstate.
Witnesses said the gunman was dressed in camouflage, with a dark cap and carried an assault-type rifle. It was not known whether he was an employee at the plant, but several said they thought he may be going on a deer hunting vacation.
One employee at the plant, who identified herself as Christy, told WWJ Radio the gunman told her, ""Get out of here"" before he started shooting in the plant.
""He knew what he was doing. He just started shooting, and when he ran out of ammo, he just reloaded and kept on shooting,"" she saiid.
The shooting is the third at a Ford plant in the Detroit area since August 1994. It also falls on the fifth anniversary of a 1991 tragedy in which a fired postal worker went on a shooting rampage at the Royal Oak, Mich., post office, killing himself and four others.
In August of this year, a Ford employee killed a security guard at a Ford climate control plant in Plymouth, Mich., then shot himself. On January 7, 1995, a Ford worker at the same factory wounded his estranged wife, killed her boyfriend, then shot himself to death.
In August 1994, a United Auto Workers official at Ford's Rouge industrial complex in Dearborn, Mich., shot two of his fellow union committeemen to death and wounded two others in a dispute over union policy.
Chrysler Corp, also has had its share of tragedy. In December 1994, a worker upset about a job assignment killed his foreman and wounded a coworker at a metal stamping plant in Sterling Heights, Mich.
"
48,"Chrysler Corp said Tuesday it filed an appeal protesting a California Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) ban on the company shipping new vehicles to dealers as a penalty for allegedly violating the state's ""lemon law.""
The move, which was expected, means the U.S No. 3 automaker can delay the 45-day ban taking effect for years as it pursues an appeal through the legal system.  
The ban, issued October 16, came after the DMV determined Chrysler resold 116 vehicles in 1991 and 1992 without properly disclosing to new owners the cars were so-called lemons, a term that refers to vehicles with chronic repair problems.
In its appeal to California's New Motor Vehicle Board, Chrysler called the DMV's actions a ""draconian penalty."" The company argues it complied with the lemon law as it was written at the time of the vehicle sales.  
Chrysler said the statute in effect at the time was vague about which vehicles repurchased by manufacturers had to be branded as lemons. Specifically, it said the law did not address disclosures relating to the resale of other vehicles bought back by automakers, such as those repurchased after informal dispute resoltions, or as part of a legal settlement.
Chrysler said it made good faith efforts to keep used car buyers informed about the vehicles they were purchasing. The company also complained about the economic ramifications of the penalty on its 240 California dealers.
""The economic harm to the dealers and their employees caused by this action has been well documented but ignored by the DMV,"" the company said in its appeal.
The New Motor Vehicle Board, which was set up to render an impartial view of regulatory actions, can reverse or amend the DMV's decision.
Chrysler sold nearly 170,000 new cars and trucks in California in 1995, representing close to eight percent of its annual volume, according to R.L. Polk &amp; Co.
The DMV ban, which would have taken effect November 25, was hailed by consumer advocates as the first tough stance aimed at ending the process of ""lemon laundering.""

48,"Chrysler Corp. minivans have came under fire again from safety regulators, who said Tuesday they stepped up probes into two problems, including reports that a 90-pound rear hatch door can suddenly close without warning.
Nearly 2 million minivans are involved in the investigations, which were also sparked by reports that side sliding doors on 1996 models flew open at high speeds.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it has received reports that 39 people have been injured when the rear hatch door on 1991-1993 model Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans dropped unexpectedly.
The problem occurs when bolts holding cylinders that prop the door open shear, according to the federal safety agency. The agency has received a total of 477 complaints. The probe, first launched in May and upgraded on Oct. 31, covers almost 1.3 million minivans.
NHTSA also upgraded a preliminary investigation into about 582,000 1996-model Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans. It has received 19 complaints that the right or left sliding door can come open while the vehicle is moving.
Owners have reported doors opening a few inches or flying wide open at speeds from 15 to 60 mph. No injuries have been reported. NHTSA said it is not aware of any incidents involving vehicles built during or after January 1996.
Chrysler was the first automaker to offer a sliding door on the left side of a minivan. The feature has made the No. 3 automaker's minivans the hottest seller in a popular segment.
Chrysler agreed in 1995, under pressure from regulators, to replace the latches on the rear hatch doors on more than 4 million minivans but stopped short of recalling the vehicles, from the 1984 through 1995 model years. Safety officials said the doors could pop open during low-speed crashes.
A Chrysler official could not be reached to comment.
But the company has told the safety agency the sliding door problem may stem from incorrect latch adjustments by dealers, which the company attributed to problems with the service manual.
Chrysler also said eight of the complaints about side doors opening involved vehicles that had had door repairs made. Chrysler said it has corrected the manual procedure and has made three design changes to door components.
But NHTSA said it has continued to receive complaints about the doors opening on vehicles with no repair history.
Separately, NHTSA said it upgraded an investigation into 621,000 1995 and 1996 Windstar minivans from Ford Motor Co. Regulators have received 327 complaints about brake problems, which have led to 76 accidents and two injuries.
In addition to the incidents reported to NHTSA, Ford said it has received 64,000 warranty claims that could relate to a brake problem causing long stopping distances.
Also, NHTSA said it opened an investigation into Land Rover's Discovery sport/utility vehicle. It has received two complaints that the right front door opened on 1996 models. Rover is a unit of German carmaker BMW.
Chrysler stock fell 25 cents to $34.75 on the New York Stock exchange in afternoon trading.

48,"While General Motors Corp. struggles to overcome labour costs of $43 an hour at its parts plants, the head of one global auto supplier is painting a Darwinian view of the future, in which an increasing number of workers earn less than $10 an hour.
Nearly one-quarter of ITT Automotive Inc.'s workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly wage and benefit rate of less than $10 by 2000, the company's top executive said this week at a conference of suppliers.
That sobering forecast spotlights a long-term problem for GM, which is now in the throes of negotiating a new three-year labour contract with the United Auto Workers union.
""They can't make a buck stamping out taillights and paying people $43 an hour,"" said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.
Adds Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi: ""Their 43 other competitors aren't going to say 'We'll spot you a couple of years.'""
Timothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive, said the company paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers around the world less than $10 an hour in 1995. That was up from 10 percent of its employees at that pay level in 1990.
""Do we do that because we're mean?"" Leuliette said of the falling wage rates. ""No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3 to 4 percent price reduction.""
Facing union demands for greater job security, GM must find a way for its massive Delphi Automotive Systems parts business to stay competitive in the worldwide auto supplier market.
In the current talks, Delphi has said 12 of its U.S. component facilities are underperforming and should not be subject to the job guarantees the UAW has received from other automakers.
Even if it accepts the economic terms already agreed to by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. , GM and Delphi will pay the average U.S. parts worker a base wage of nearly $19 an hour in the first year of the contract, and more than $21 in 1999, the third year of the agreement.
About 42 percent of Delphi's workers are located in the United States, where the combined hourly wage and benefit cost of a UAW worker under the 1993 national agreement is about $43.
Delphi, with 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion, is in 167 businesses around the world. Global expansion remains a focus for the company, which this year expects 35 percent of its revenues to come from customers outside of GM's North American Operations, Delphi President J.T. Battenberg said Tuesday.
But as Leuliette's comments indicate, the global auto supplier industry is growing increasingly competitive.
The worldwide hourly wage rate for assembling a labour-intensive part such as a wire harness is between $1 and $2, he estimated. More technical parts cost $10-$12 an hour.
Leuliette said workers in Vietnam will earn $64 a month working 48 hours a week putting together wiring harnesses for ITT.
""If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,"" Leuliette told the gathering of suppliers in Detroit.
ITT Automotive, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is the biggest unit within ITT Industries Inc., and one of the largest independent auto suppliers in the world.
The company, which has annual sales of about $5.5 billion, makes brake and chassis systems, as well as body and electrical components such as motors, actuators and wiper systems. Leuliette estimated the company's average global total wage costs at about $14 an hour.
"
48,"Peregrine Inc. may let go up to half of the 5,500 hourly employees at the four former General Motors Corp. component plants it purchased last month, the new company's top executive said Thursday.
Peregrine Chief Executive Officer Edward Gulda, in a briefing with reporters, said workers not needed at Peregrine would be able to transfer back to GM.
People who stay with Peregrine will be paid according to the terms of the new United Auto Worker and Canadian Auto Worker contracts worked out with GM in November and October.
Peregrine was formed by the New York investment firm Joseph Littlejohn &amp; Levy to purchase the four plants from GM's Delphi Automotive Systems unit. Peregrine formally takes over the plants Jan. 1.
The plants, two of them in Michigan and two located in Ontario, make a variety of parts, including window regulators, door hardware, interior trim, structural plastics and metal stampings.
Gulda outlined several steps the new management has mapped out to streamline cost structures and expand the company's operations from the current annual revenue base of about $1 billion. He said three of the four plants are expected to turn a profit in 1997, with the fourth breaking even.
Peregrine, which will be based in Southfield, Mich., will make annual capital investments of at least $20 million a year into the four facilities, he said. Funds will come from cash generated by the operations and initial investor capital.
UAW parts workers earn about $43 an hour, including benefits -- substantially more than non-union companies pay for their workforce. But Gulda said the plants can still be competitive at those wage rates.
""Those people who say they can't be competitive with that just aren't very imaginative,"" he said. ""It isn't a question of what individual people make in the company, it's a question of being worth what you make.""
Peregrine expects its overall business to decline over the next two years as a result of past sourcing actions from GM, the company's major customer. But Gulda said future acquisitions, new GM business and internal growth will more than offset that decline.
Three to four years from now, Gulda said he expected Peregrine to generate roughly half of its revenue from non-GM customers as it expands from a regional structure to a global one. He said he would be disappointed if the firm had not doubled its revenues in five years.
Future acquisitions, which could come as soon as early next year, would complement Peregrine's existing business lines, Gulda said. He said the firm may be interested in purchasing other plants from GM's Delphi unit. He also said Peregrine might sell stock to the public, although that is at least two years away.
One of the first facilities to be upgraded will be the door hinge and hardware plant in Flint, Mich., which will receive an immediate overhaul of its stamping operations.
The plant in Livonia, Mich., which makes interior door panels and other trim components, has the most serious structural problems and will require the most significant upgrades, he said.
Gulda said the seat plant in Windsor, Ontario, is an ""excellent facility."" Key to its future is extending capacity and finding new business as soon as possible, he said.
Peregrine also plans to expand the mold and pain capacity at the faciltiy in Oshawa, Ontario, and improving its cost structure.
"
48,"Bargainers for the United Auto Workers union and General Motors Corp. continued bargaining on Sunday but kept a tight lid on whether any progress was being made toward a new labour pact as a midnight (0500 GMT) deadline loomed.
GM spokesman Ray Deibel said talks resumed at midmorning Sunday after they adjourned Saturday evening. He declined to be more specific, or to say if GM Chairman Jack Smith is taking part in the discussions at the automaker's headquarters in downtown Detroit.
At stake is a new labour agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three not to have a new three-year labour contract.
Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers to whom GM is obligated to guarantee jobs.
Bowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces, except in the event of a severe industry downturn.
""I think if there's a sticking point that may be it,"" said Dale Brickner, a labour expert at the Michigan State University. ""GM may be pushing to get that figure farther down than the UAW may be comfortable living with.""
GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, is trying to shed 12 unprofitable parts plants, and wants to exclude certain component facilities from the employment guarantee. Those include a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.
In settling a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the selling of two parts plants and flexibility to outsource UAW President Stephen Yokich had not indicated what he would do after the contract extension expires at midnight Sunday. Yokich on Friday set the Sunday deadline, but did not actually threaten a strike .
However, there was speculation Sunday the UAW could mount a plant-specific strike if enough progress has not been met by the deadline Sunday.
By hitting light truck plants, such as the sport/utility facility in Janesville, Wisc., the union could hurt the sale of some of GM's most profitable products at a time when it is trying to bounce back from the Canadian strike.
Brickner said the UAW used that strategy in the mid-1980s to hamper individual sites without shutting down the entire North American production system.
GM's U.S. operations continue to respond to the strike by 26,000 CAW workers.
More than 6,600 UAW members at GM's Buick City complex were told not to report on Monday. At the same time, however, GM was running radio ads telling first-shift workers at its Hamtramck assembly plant to report to work on Monday.
"
22,"Most U.S. nursing home and hospital companies are expected to report higher profits in the fourth quarter on some easy comparisons, but Wall Street is wary of negative surprises.
""A lot of them are going against very weak results last year so they have easy comparisons,"" said NatWest Securities industry analyst Marie Conway.
At the same time, Schroder Wertheim analyst William McKeever said, ""There's probably more potential for downside to earnings than upside ... There could be disappointments.""  
Pressing industry issues such as Medicare and Medicaid reform and reimbursement rates for contract therapy services remain unresolved. ""Little progress has been made in Washington,"" said Scott &amp; Stringfellow analyst George Shipp.
The industry finished a volatile 1996 on the upswing after a big summer sell-off. The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Provider index of 15 top hospital management and nursing home stocks was near 326 Tuesday, up from 288 at the start of the year.
""We like the sector in general, although there are some issues that have dogged certain companies,"" Conway said.  
For instance, Sun Healthcare Group Inc and Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp, dragged down by various problems, have lagged the sector, she said.
Earnings at Integrated Health Services Inc are forecast to be barely improved from last year after the company's acquisitions of Coram Healthcare Corp and First American Health Care of Georgia Inc. ""They've made a very bold bet on home healthcare ... Things at Integrated are getting a little better,"" Shipp said.  
Health Management Associates Inc is expected to lead the for-profit hospital sector in earnings gains, with moderate increases projected for Tenet HealthCare and sector giant Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.

22,"General Instrument Corp pleased Wall Street Tuesday by announcing a three-way corporate break-up that analysts said will unlock the value of the company's core high-tech communications systems business.
""Generally, these things work in the sense that when you do the spinoff, the sum of the parts tends to be greater than the initial whole,"" said industry analyst Hickman Powell at Southeast Research Partners.
At the same time, the planned creation of three new companies raises some questions, analysts said.
Chicago-based General Instrument said it will create a company to be called NextLevel Systems Inc out of its cable television, satellite and telephone businesses.
Also planned is creation of a new firm called CommScope Inc out of a world-leading coaxial cable manufacturing business, and General Semiconductor Inc out of electronic component manufacturing operations.
""Investors will be able to value each of the three companies on its own merits and growth fundamentals,"" said General Instrument chief executive Richard Friedland.
Shares in General Instrument were up 1/4 to 23 at midday.
The prize to emerge from the bust-up will be NextLevel, focused on high-speed modems, television cable set-top boxes and other hot areas. ""That's where the growth is,"" said analyst Louis Ehrenkrantz of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
But some analysts questioned how the business will fund its growth after being stripped of the coaxial and semiconductor businesses, which throw off large cash flows.
""The answer must be that that portion will have to, from time to time, come to the equity market,"" Powell said, adding that a recent optic fiber deal with NYNEX Corp bodes well for NextLevel.
Optic fiber is replacing coaxial cable in many places, especially along communications trunk lines, which may pose a threat to the distant future of CommScope, analysts said.
But Powell pointed out, ""There's still quite a lot of the world to be cabled up...That company, by the way, has been gaining market share.""
Finally, General Semiconductor on its own will suffer from the same cyclical swings in the electronic components markets that drove it as a unit of General Instrument, analysts said.
""Two-thirds of that company are going to be very good stocks. The semi-conductor unit, well, it will come along when the semiconductors recover,"" Ehrenkrantz said.
General Instrument said the break-up will force it to take charges against earnings of as much as $135 million on its fourth quarter results due February 10 and later this year.
"
22,"Wall Street hammered shares of Swedish-American drug giant Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Friday after it said profits would fall far short of expectations.
The company said it expects earnings of about 44 cents a share for the third quarter, equal to year-ago results. Analysts had expected 10 cents more than that and hit the stock hard after the announcement.
The stock dropped as much as $6.50 before trading down $5.25 at $34.875 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 18 million shares had changed hands by early afternoon.
The company blamed foreign exchange problems, pricing pressures and weak U.S. sales of older products for the shortfall. It also cited a sales force transition and ""the usual short-term disruptions seen in a multinational merger.""
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn was formed by the merger of Sweden's Pharmacia AB and Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn Co. It formally began operations in November 1995.
""This clearly indicates that the merger is not going as smoothly as hoped. I think this is a wake-up call,"" said independent pharmaceuticals industry analyst Hemant Shah.
With few new high-margin products expected out of the pipeline for the next year or so, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn had been hoping that the merger would produce cost savings and other synergies that would help it through the dry spell.
""The problem is, they're not realising synergies as they thought they would,"" said Mehta &amp; Isaly analyst Steve Lisi.
""They were hoping that through this merger they would realise synergies to ride this out ... We just don't know if they can do it,"" Lisi said. ""They'll get through these next couple of years, but it's going to be ugly.""
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Chief Executive John Zabriskie said the merger is producing benefits, including a 3,000 person reduction in the work force to date. The company also said it continues to expect $500 million in cost savings by 1998.
Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year are expected to top year-ago levels, buoyed by two new drugs, Xalatan for glaucoma and Camptosar for cancer, the company said.
But analysts were uncertain about the near-term outlook and said the company offers no firm guidance for next year.
""There's a cloud over the beginning of 1997,"" said Rodman &amp; Renshaw analyst Mario Corso.
"
22,"The Food and Drug Administration is approving new drugs and medical devices at a rapid clip this year, heartening drug and device companies that have long criticised the agency.
In the federal fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the agency cleared for U.S. marketing 46 new drugs, up from 26 approvals in fiscal 1995, the agency said.
In the same period, 37 new medical devices were cleared, up from 27 the year before, according to a tally kept by Montgomery Securities, an investments firm.
""What you are seeing is the culmination of improvements in the review system that date back 10 years or more,"" said FDA associate commissioner for public affairs Jim O'Hara.
Even long-time FDA critic the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PHARMA, sounded congratulatory, albeit with reservations. ""Improvments have been made in the last couple of years,"" said Jeff Trewhitt, PHARMA spokesman.
Two bills before Congress that proposed more flexible and shorter FDA new drug reviews died without action with the adjournment of the House and Senate last week, a sign that the agency's actions have blunted attacks from outside critics.
Drug and medical device industry analysts said faster FDA approvals are helping companies in both sectors by reducing their research and development risks.
A year ago, companies had complained that burdensome U.S. regulatory oversight threatened to drive U.S. drug and medical technology research to Europe, known for speedier reviews.
But a study released this spring showed the FDA's median review time for new drugs approved in 1994 and 1995 was 1.3 years, as fast as that of Britain and faster than those of France, Spain, Germany, Australia, Japan, Italy and Canada, according to the FDA. The study was conducted by the British-based Centre for Medicines Research, the agency said.
""In 1996, the U.S. is reviewing and approving ... faster than any other country,"" O'Hara said.
He credited internal reforms at the FDA largely to passage by Congress in 1992 of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which made more money available to the agency through a system of user fees imposed on companies.
Those revenues have paid for the hiring of more reviewers and upgrading of FDA information systems, he said.
"
22,"In a move that would reshape the medical device business, St. Jude Medical Inc. agreed Wednesday to make four strategic transactions that would lift it into the top ranks of manufacturers of devices for regulating heartbeat.
The $665 million package of interlocking deals is costly and poses some risks, but likely will proceed, analysts said.
The stock of St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude fell $1.25 to 37.375 after the announcement, while shares in other companies in the industry also fell.
The main thrust of St. Jude's moves was an agreement to buy Ventritex Inc. in a stock swap valued at $505 million.
Ventritex, of Sunnyvale, Calif., is the smallest of three companies that dominate the fast-growing, $500 million world market for implantable defibrillators, or ICDs -- electronic devices implanted in the chest and connected to the heart by wires to keep it from beating too rapidly.
""There's a small chance this won't go through, and the Street is also concerned about dilution. But I think this is perfect timing ... It's an idea whose time has come,"" said Montgomery Securities medical technology analyst Kurt Kruger.
To resolve some long-standing legal actions and help free Ventritex from cross-licensing restrictions that have hobbled it for years, St. Jude is making three smaller deals.
The company agreed to buy some assets from Telectronics Pacing Systems, a unit of Australia's Pacific Dunlop; to acquire Medtel, an Asia-Pacific medical goods distributor also tied to Pacific Dunlop; and to buy certain intellectual property rights from the Intermedics unit of SulzerMedica, owned by Swiss medical giant Sulzer AG.
""Part of the brilliance of this deal is bringing all these parties together,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Arch Smith.
St. Jude is the world's largest maker of heart valves, markets for which are growing, but slowly.
In search of growth and risk diversification, chief executive Ronald Matricaria engineered St. Jude's 1994 acquisition for $500 million of the Pacesetter Inc. unit of Germany's Siemens AG. The deal transformed St. Jude into a leading manufacturer of heart pacemakers.
Since then, rumours have swirled that St. Jude might acquire Ventritex -- a deal seen by many analysts as setting a capstone on Matricaria's efforts.
""If he pulls this off, it's the highlight of his career,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein.
Even with St. Jude's careful efforts, analysts said legal action could ensue. The other two main players in the ICD market -- Medtronic Inc. and Guidant Corp. -- could seize the chance to drag St. Jude into the courtroom.
Shares in Minneapolis-based Medtronic fell 12.5 cents to $64.125, while shares in Indianapolis-based Guidant dropped $2 to $41.50. Analysts said both fell on a perceived competitive threat from the St. Jude-Ventritex combination.
""Medtronic's world is getting more competitive, but I think they're less vulnerable than Guidant ... A hard rain is going to fall on Guidant,"" Kruger said.
"
22,"When Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc launched Caverject, an anti-impotence drug, it ordered the usual marketing programme and then, in line with a growing trend, it called Time magazine.
And Newsweek and Smithsonian and New Yorker and more than 50 other national publications and radio stations -- all of which are now engaged in a huge ""consumer awareness"" campaign about impotence, paid for by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn.
Whether it is impotence, baldness, depression, schizophrenia, osteoporosis or allergies, U.S. consumers are being flooded with ads for health problems and often, in a departure from tradition, prescription drugs to cure them.
Spending on advertising on prescription drugs throughout the U.S. media topped $323 million in the first six months of 1996, compared to $356.8 million for the whole of 1995, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a market research firm.
""It certainly is a growing category for Time magazine and for news magazines in general,"" said Robert Pondiscio, spokesman for the Time Warner newsweekly.
Time broke new ground in the area this month with a 90-page special issue called ""Frontiers of Medicine"" almost fully underwritten by Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc, the largest drug manufacturer in the world.
The spread of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising marks a victory for drug companies, which fought for years with physicians and regulators opposed to it.
The American Medical Association, based here, still stands publicly against such advertising. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after banning the adverts in the early 1980s, now allows them if they follow certain guidelines.
FDA rules explain why prescription drug advertisements sometimes identify a company and a drug but do not on other occasions.
For instance, Pfizer Inc is advertising its Zyrtec allergy drug in the main U.S. dailies. The ads show a picture of a smiling woman surrounded by wildflowers and weeds. Underneath is large-type text promoting the drug and off to one side is a 1,500-word ""brief summary"" in fine print about side-effects and dosages. The summary is required by the FDA because the ad mentions Pfizer's and the drug's names.
In contrast, one of Glaxo's many ads in the Time special issue is about how Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee keeps her asthma under control with a ""program"" put together by Glaxo. A free telephone number is provided. Callers are automatically sent a complimentary ""asthma control kit"" from Glaxo.
No mention is made in the advertisement that Glaxo is a world leader in asthma medicines. Its Ventolin is an industry standard. Serevent was introduced a year ago and Flovent was just unveiled. Because none of these drugs is named in the ad, it does not have to include a brief summary of their attributes.
The FDA is talking with drug companies and broadcasters about how to handle radio and TV ads for prescription drugs. Some advertisements are broadcast, but so far remain much rarer than those in print.
These ads -- whether they name the drug or not -- are meant to raise consumers' awareness of new drugs and to reach doctors -- medicine's decision-makers -- through patients.
""The ads are effective in informing consumers of the availability of a drug. The action step is to suggest to the consumer that they consult their physician,"" said Dick Johnson, spokesman for Hoechst Marion Roussel, which is advertising its Allegra allergy medicine with pictures of a windsurfer skimming across an open field.
The ads seem to be working on the consumer.
In 1987, about 18 percent of U.S. patients initiated conversations with their physicians about advertised drugs. That figure was up to 51 percent in 1995, according to a study done by American Home Products Corp, which advertises Premarin for menopause and Effexor for depression.
""The ads create a more educated consumer and an educated consumer is more prepared to have an intelligent dialogue with the physician,"" said American Home spokeswoman Audrey Ashby.
Whether or not that dialogue leads doctors to write more prescriptions for advertised drugs, thereby boosting sales for the drug companies, is difficult to judge because the companies will not disclose such details.
No objective studies have determined if drug companies gain incremental revenues from advertising, but the companies' growing advertising budgets in themselves may be a sign of success.
""If these ads weren't working, why would they be doing them? Unless they were being forced to by competitors,"" said Stephen Scala, pharmaceuticals industry analyst with Cowen &amp; Co.
Advertising is a vital part of the over-the-counter drugs business, where the consumer -- not the doctor -- calls the shots. The kind of competitive pressures that drive over-the-counter markets may help explain the spread of advertising for prescription drugs, as well, Scala said.
But, he added, the role of consumers in a changing healthcare system are part of the answer, too.
""People are more knowledgable and aware and willing to learn about their treatments than they used to be,"" he said.
"
22,"Eight of the top 10 publicly traded U.S. health maintenance organizations are expected to report lower or flat fourth-quarter profits as the industry shuts the books on a dismal year and moves warily into 1997.
Dissatisfied with narrow profit margins, Wall Street is turning cautious on many HMO stocks, although plenty of merger and acquisition action underlies the sector and is supporting the share prices of firms seen as targets.
""Consolidation will remain at a high level,"" said Salomon Brothers managed healthcare analyst Robert Hoehn.  
As HMOs report quarterly results over the next few weeks, two companies are expected to defy the earnings slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plans Inc has been a bright spot in the gloom all year and is forecast to post profits 70 percent higher than the year-ago level, analysts said.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc is expected to show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, although its quarter will be complicated by a pending acquisition of FHP International Corp.
""It's sort of a throw-away quarter for"" PacifiCare, said Volpe Welty analyst Ed Keaney.  
The problem that most HMOs were unable to solve throughout 1996 was a costly mismatch between medical cost inflation forecasts that fell short and an inability to push through compensatory premium increases. A margin squeeze resulted.
""This year there may be room for a little bit of (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, but not enough of an increase to make it possible for these companies to restore margins to previous levels,"" Keaney said.
Citing small premium rises so far in the January renewal period, Hoehn said: ""Uncertainties regarding profitability will remain, albeit at a reduced level from 1996.""

22,"Aon Corp. said Wednesday it agreed to acquire Alexander &amp; Alexander Services Inc. for about $1.23 billion, creating by some counts the world's largest insurance and risk consulting company.
Aon, a Chicago-based insurance holding company, said it will pay $17.50 a share, or about $790 million, for Alexander &amp; Alexander's common stock and about $437.5 million to holders of the company's preferred stock.
Layoffs and office closings are expected to follow the deal as Aon moves to cut cost, analysts said.
With offices around the world, Aon employs about 27,000 people; Alexander &amp; Alexander about 12,000.
""You have to assume every place there's an Aon office and an Alex office, one of them has got to close. And that's a lot of places,"" said Conning &amp; Co. insurance analyst Gary Ransom.
Aon Chairman Patrick Ryan said he could not estimate possible job cuts.
""I don't think you should look for huge layoffs,"" he said.
Alexander &amp; Alexander's stock jumped $3.125 to $17.25, while Aon rose $1 to $58.625, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Alexander &amp; Alexander, based in New York, is the fourth-largest insurance broker in the world. It has operations in 80 countries, primarily the United States, Canada and Britain.
After its acquisition of Alexander &amp; Alexander, Aon will become either the largest or second-largest insurance broker in the world.
How it will size up against rival giant Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Inc. depends on how their operations are counted, Ryan said. ""It's not apples to apples,"" he said.
Aon said it will begin a cash tender offer for Alexander &amp; Alexander's common shares no later than Dec. 16 and upon completion of the tender offer the purchase of the preferred shares will begin.
""Virtually everyone who watches the insurance industry has been expecting this deal,"" said Robinson-Humphrey insurance analyst Thomas Rosencrants.
""It's a fair price. A&amp;A has been struggling for 15 years. There will be tremendous economies of scale to come out of this as A&amp;A is folded into Aon,"" Rosencrants said.
Analysts said they would expect Ryan to head up the combined operations and Alexander &amp; Alexander Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Zarb to step aside.
""I would have to assume that Frank Zarb would not be around,"" Ransom said.
The deal was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, Aon said.
Over the past decade, the insurance industry has become increasingly competitive and insurers have been forced to hold down premium rate increases, which has put downward pressure on their profit margins.
""There's no end in sight to the 10-year soft market,"" Rosencrants said.
Competition has pressured companies to look for strategic alternatives and led to industry consolidation.
Aon in October completed a $250 million acquisition of Bain Hogg Group Inc. from Britain's Inchcape Plc. The Alexander &amp; Alexander deal likely caps Aon's acquisition drive for now, analysts said.
""The industry has been consolidating. Certainly people have been expecting us to continue to be a leader in that,"" Ryan said. ""We've made two what we think to be strategic and good acquisitions. Now we've got to put them together.""
Aon added that its offer was still subject to several conditions, including the tender and non-withdrawal of at least a majority of the voting power of A&amp;A's common shares, and various regulatory approvals.

22,"United Airlines has ordered $4.4 billion worth of airplanes from Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus Industrie, with the the lion's share going to Boeing, the airline announced Thursday.
United ordered 27 wide-body jets -- 19 jumbo 747-400s, six 757s and two 777s -- valued at about $3.5 billion from Boeing and 24 narrow-body Airbus A319s valued at $900 million.
The Chicago-based UAL Corp. unit is the first U.S. airline to order Airbus' latest model, United and Airbus said.
United chose the Airbus planes over competing Boeing 737-700s and 737-300s after evaluating both, a UAL spokesman said.
""United benefited from substantial discounts to the prices from both manufacturers,"" the airline said, noting that the order values it quoted were based on manufacturers' list prices.
United said the planes will be part of its ""retire and replace"" programme to update its fleet.
""By 2000, the programme is expected to generate more than $100 million in annual operating cost savings, reducing fuel, maintenance and labour costs,"" the airline said.
The programme will also ensure that United meets certain noise reduction requirements.
Delivery of all aircraft is scheduled to be completed by 2002, United said.
The carrier said it placed orders with United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit for engines for the Boeing aircraft and with International Aero Engines AG for engines for the Airbus jets. United Technologies owns 33 percent of International Aero Engines.
The Airbus A319s will replace United's older Boeing 737-200s, the airline and Airbus said. The new planes are configured to seat 126 passengers.
The A319 is a smaller derivative of the Airbus A320. United already operates 34 A320s and will take delivery of 16 more by the end of 1998, they said.
United joins German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG as the largest airline customers for the A320 family, each with 74 planes.
Airbus Industrie is a consortium made up of French-owned Societe Nationale Industrielle, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

22,"ClinTrials Research Inc expects to continue to expand revenues 35 to 45 percent per year, thanks to growing use by major pharmaceutical companies of outside research help and market share gains by the firm -- the world's fifth-largest contract research concern.
""We can grow at the 35-45 percent rate over the next several years and be able to handle it,"" said chief executive William O'Neil on Tuesday in remarks to investors at a Robinson-Humphrey investors conference here.
Later, in an interview with Reuters, O'Neil said the Nashville, Tenn.-based company estimates that drug and biotechnology companies spend $10 to $11 billion annually on research and development.
About $2.5 billion, or roughly one quarter, is outsourced to companies such as ClinTrials and rivals, including the Corning Research unit of Corning Inc and Quintiles Transnational Corp. ""Five years ago, only five percent was outsourced. So it's been growing very rapidly,"" O'Neil said.
Moreover, he said, R&amp;D spending is growing about 10 percent annually and ClinTrials is taking market share from smaller contract researchers. ""Of the additional dollars being spent, more is being shifted to us,"" he said.
ClinTrials recently acquired BioResearch Laboratories Inc, of Montreal, for $65 million. The acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and effectively reduced ClinTrials' tax rate thanks to Canadian laws under which BioResearch pays no taxes, O'Neil said.
Without another major acquisition, ClinTrials likely will stay for now in the fifth-largest position in the contract research market, he said. Although he would not rule out another major deal, O'Neil said one is not in the offing.
Eighty percent of revenues for the company come from major drug companies, with biotech firms and medical device manufacturers making up the balance.
When such companies develop a new compound or device they hope may be marketable, they must test it through an extensive series of clinical trials. Animal subjects are first used. Later human patients become involved. All tests have to be conducted under standards set out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other government regulators.
When launched in 1990, ClinTrials handled portions of research work that had overflowed the capacities of drug and biotech firms. Today, O'Neil said, ClinTrials finds itself increasingly built into the R&amp;D budgets of clients.
Last week, ClinTrials for the third quarter reported profits of $2 million, or $0.18 per share, on revenues of $25.4 million. In the year-ago period, profits were $979,000, or $0.11 per share, on revenues of $16 million.
Shares in the company closed up 1/2 at 38 on Tuesday.

40,"Television industry moguls crafting a ratings system should spell out sexual and violence content of shows, not rely solely on a system like the motion picture code, a survey of parents issued Thursday concluded.
The nationwide survey of 679 parents showed 80 percent preferred a system that specified the level of violence, sex or bad language rather than the age group for which a program is intended, as the motion picture industry's 28-year-old system does for movies.
The survey was a joint effort of the National Parent Teacher Association, the Institute for Mental Health Initiatives and University of Wisconsin researchers. It came as TV executives raced to complete a ratings system in the next month.
The executives favor an approach like the alphabetical code used by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for movies. Individual networks would rate their shows.
But the survey sponsors -- along with Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. -- want a system that covers content and viewer age.
""Parents want it all. They want every shred of information available about every program,"" said Markey, the author of a provision in the new communications law requiring TV makers to install a ""V-chip"" in all new sets. The device can be used with the upcoming ratings to let parents block shows they consider too violent or racy.
Markey told a news conference it would be ""very unfortunate"" if the TV industry ignored the survey results and did not incorporate the kind of system used by the Home Box Office cable-TV movie channel to rate its shows. Each HBO show is given a rating based on content such as ""MV"" for ""mild violence"" or ""SC"" for ""strong sexual content.""
Markey vowed the groups sponsoring the poll would ""scream to the high heavens"" if the TV ratings ignored program content.
MPAA President Jack Valenti, overseeing the ratings' creation, said his group welcomed all suggestions. ""We are trying to devise a TV parental guidance system which will be family friendly, easy to understand, easy to use, and most of all grounded in honorable purposes so that parents can better monitor and supervise the TV watching of their children.""
"
40,"Lawmakers and law-enforcement officials voiced support Wednesday for tougher laws to bar eavesdropping on cellular phone calls, following the uproar over Newt Gingrich's intercepted call.
A House telecommunications subcommittee is training its sights on a little-enforced law banning the sale, manufacture and importation of scanners that can pick up cellular calls.
Despite the 1992 law, scanner enthusiasts have used legal loopholes to modify tens of thousands of otherwise legal scanners so they can overhear cellular traffic. An estimated 10 million legal scanners are in the hands of the public.
""Our goal is to make sure that the sale of this kind of equipment drops precipitously,"" declared Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and author of the law.
Markey, speaking at a hearing of the subcommittee, called the modified scanners ""a great danger to the presumption of privacy"" enjoyed by users of cellular phones.
Markey expressed support for closing the necessary loopholes to make it tougher for scanner operators to illegally tap in on cellular calls.
The head of the subcommittee, Representative Billy Tauzin, R-La., also said ""there is a problem in enforcement.""
He noted the Federal Communications Commission refers potential criminal cases to other agencies ""that may have less interest in enforcing the anti-intercept laws, due to other, and perhaps, more important law-enforcement priorities.
""Perhaps a solution is to rationalise the respective enforcement roles of the FCC, the Justice Department and the FBI,"" Tauzin added.
Last month, the FBI opened an investigation into the taping and leaking of an embarrassing conference call between House Speaker Gingrich and his top lieutenants.
The probe came after a Florida couple said they delivered a tape of the cell-phone conversation to the senior Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, which was deliberating over a politically charged case involving Gingrich.
A transcript of the tape was published in two newspapers two days later, prompting Republican calls for an FBI criminal probe into the source of the tape.
Federal law also makes it a crime to intentionally intercept or disclose the contents of a phone call, regardless of whether it is over a hard-wired, cellular or cordless phone. Criminal violation is punishable by a penalty of up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
But in the case of wireless calls in particular, the law is little enforced and penalties are light because cellular traffic is so easily intercepted.
Unless there are ""aggravating"" circumstances, such as a repeat offence, eavesdropping on a cellular call is treated as an infraction, with no jail time and a maximum fine of $5,000.
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt suggested to lawmakers they explore ""whether it continues to make sense"" to levy different penalties for eavesdropping on the different types of calls.
""From the point of view of the person having the conversation, the invasion of privacy is the same,"" he said.
"
40,"Responding to a dispute with the United States, Canada said Tuesday it plans to develop its own satellite-TV industry rather than rely on U.S. companies such as Tele-Communications Inc. to jump-start the business.
The announcement came just hours after the Federal Communications Commission rejected for a second time a bid by TCI and Colorado-based TelQuest Ventures to beam TV programmes to the United States from two satellites in Canadian-authorised orbits.
The Canadian satellites also would have beamed shows to Canadian households via pizza-sized dishes. The satellites were to have been launched by Telesat Canada, a Montreal-based satellite-communications company. It planned to lease space to both TelQuest and TCI, the No. 1 U.S. cable TV operator.
""My belief is that the time has come for us to proceed with a possible Canada-only solution and my hope is that there will be some companies that will be able to pursue that, including Telesat,"" Canada's minister of industry John Manley told reporters in Ottawa.
Manley plans soon to invite Canadian companies to bid for the ownership and operation of two Canadian satellites.
He told Telesat in a letter Monday he would revoke his ministry's support for the company to have access to the two satellite slots, unless the FCC gave the needed green light.
The FCC, however, rejected the TCI and TelQuest requests by noting that the Canadian government had not yet officially licensed the two satellites. The FCC had issued the same decision earlier in the summer, prompting TelQuest and TCI in August to file emergency requests for FCC approval.
Lawyers and government officials said the basis of the dispute stems from the Clinton administration's objection to allowing a Canadian satellite to beam programmes into the United States -- while U.S. companies cannot enjoy the same rights to broadcast into Canada.
In July, administration officials urged the FCC to defer action on TCI and TelQuest's bid to offer direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services from the Canadian orbital slots.
Officials from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the State Department said in a letter to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt that the requests ""raise foreign, trade or competition policy issues within the jurisdiction of the Executive Branch.""
They argued that Canadian curbs discriminate against U.S. programmers by requiring a minimum amount of Canadian content in TV, cable and satellite-TV broadcasts. They asserted  that Canada maintains curbs on the use of non-Canadian satellites to distribute phone and broadcast services to Canada.
In his letter to Telesat, Manley noted that U.S. officials rejected proposals to allow the TCI-TelQuest venture to proceed, while not addressing the issue of Canada's content restrictions on programming.
""The Canadians are going to insist on retaining their protectionist policies on content. And since the U.S. will not accept those policies, the Canadian are picking up their DBS marbles and going home,"" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
"
40,"The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court Thursday to lift a lower court suspension of landmark federal rules aimed at prying open the nation's local telephone monopolies to competition.
The department, acting on behalf of the Federal Communications Commission, said the lower court's ""stay""  could hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of full-fledged competition in the $100 billion market.
The request comes after a U.S. appeals court based in St. Louis last week suspended key provisions of the FCC's ""interconnection"" order, which spells out how long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others could operate in the local phone market under the new telecommunications law.
The rules were frozen while the appeals court considers a challenge to the FCC order by GTE Corp., the so-called Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators who want the measure overturned.
They argue the FCC overstepped the power granted to it by Congress. The FCC, among other things, ordered the regional Bells and other local phone companies to lease their lines to new rivals at discounts of 17 percent to 25 percent.
The three-judge appeals court panel said the opponents ""have a better than even chance of convincing the court"" that the FCC's rules conflicted with the law.
But the Justice Department told the high court the appeals court action ""already imperils"" the timetable set by Congress for opening the local phone market.
""The stay draws into question not just the timing of competition in the local market, but also the timing of full entry by the Bell companies into the long-distance telephone market,"" the department added.
Long-distance carriers AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., among other companies, also asked the high court on Thursday to lift the stay.
Lawyers were divided over the likely outcome.
""They have a decent shot at lifting the stay,"" said Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. He noted the FCC's success last year in having Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens lift a lower court stay that had blocked a major FCC airwave auction.
But others were less sure. ""It's very difficult to predict,"" said Nicholas Allard of Latham &amp; Watkins.
The Justice Department request, along with those of the long-distance companies, is expected to go to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees matters related to the St. Louis-based appeals court.
Thomas could refer the request to the full court for its consideration.
"
40,"The government's largest wireless phone auction ended Tuesday, with prices taking a U-turn back toward earth after 125 companies bid a total of $2.5 billion to offer a new generation of cellular service.
The total was down 75 percent from a similar Federal Communications Commission auction that raised $10.2 billion last May. The average price for a license to provide ""personal communications services,"" or PCS, tumbled more than 90 percent.
PCS technology is expected to turn the wireless phone into a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device.
The drop reflected the flood of new entrants into the wireless phone market, a dearth of new money after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale, and the smaller slice of airwaves covered by the new licenses, analysts said.
The top bidder this time around was a unit of No. 3 long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. It bid $544 million for 160 licenses in Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta, among other cities.
Next was a unit of long-distance giant AT&amp;T Corp., which bid $407 million for 222 licenses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, followed by a unit of BellSouth Corp., which bid $205 million for 39 licenses.
The No. 4 bidder was OPCSE-Galloway Consortium, a consortium made up of Omnipoint Corp. of Arlinton, Va., and Galloway Entrepreneurs of Charlottesville, Va. It bid $181 million for 109 licenses.
The FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making this the most licenses sold at once. A third were reserved for small companies. Markets that generated the highest bidding were New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Based on the population sizes covered by the licenses, the average bid at the auction was just $3.32 a person.
That was down from the average bid of $39.88 at last May's ""C-Block"" sale, which was reserved for small companies. Analysts called those prices too high for companies to make much money.
The FCC's first PCS auction, which raised $7.7 billion and ended in March 1995, had an average bid of $15.54.
""It's phenomenally cheaper,"" said Jonathan Foxman, vice president of Americall International, a Phoenix-based PCS firm that bid at the auction.
Mark Lowenstein, a vice president with Boston consulting firm Yankee Group Inc., called the latest prices ""more reflective of the current market reality.""
Analysts listed several factors behind the lower prices.
The airwave parcels sold, at 10 megahertz (MHz) each, were a third the size of the 30 MHz parcels sold at the two prior auctions and thus less attractive. The permits cover less geographic area.
Analysts also said the wireless market was getting crowded with companies holding PCS and traditional cellular licenses -- meaning less profits.
""The market is going to be too crowded,"" predicted P. William Bane, a director at Mercer Management Consulting.
The steep prices at last year's PCS auction meant less money available this time around. ""The latest prices are an indication that people have run out of money,"" said Bane.
In addition, analysts said, Wall Street has not rushed to extend financing to PCS providers.
"
40,"Following weeks of talks, representatives from the television and computer industries reached an agreement in principle Monday on a broadcast standard for a new generation of high-definition digital TV.
The accord is aimed at allowing the Federal Communications Commission to finalise by year's end a government-prescribed standard for advanced digital TV, which offers cinema-quality pictures and CD-quality sound. TV manufacturers, as a result, hope to begin bringing digital-TV receivers to market in 1998.
While the accord between the computer, broadcast and consumer electronics industries calls on the FCC to issue a broadcast transmission standard, the agency would not mandate key aspects of digital TV technology.
Instead, the eventual shape of the TV screen and the technology for putting images on to the screen would be dictated by the market -- and not a government agency.
FCC officials welcomed the pact. ""I am confident that, based on today's announcement, the FCC can act before the end of 1996,"" Commissioner Susan Ness said in a statement.
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said, ""Our goal has been to trust the market, not government, to define the digital television of the future. Today's agreement is wholly welcome.""
Computer companies, led by Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, had objected to the broadcast standard the FCC initially proposed in May, saying it would work poorly with computers and stifle the the convergence of TV and computer technologies.
The long-promised convergence would allow consumers to watch TV and surf the Internet via the same ""smart box.""
The latest round of talks, which were held in Washington, also resolved objections raised by Hollywood directors, actors and cinematographers who complained that the proposed screen size would mangle images in wide-screen films.
The FCC proposal stalled after the Clinton administration made an election-year reversal in August and warned the plan could be ""overly prescriptive"" and could ""stymie"" development of new products and services.
It initially backed the plan, but reversed itself after the objections from the computer industry and Hollywood.
""If the FCC acts this year, it could make high-definition TV a reality for consumers in 1998,"" said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing TV makers.
The latest talks involved representatives for TV broadcasters, the big networks, TV manufacturers Philips Electronics N.A. Corp. and Thomson Consumer Electronics, plus Microsoft, Intel Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., and Apple Computer Inc.
The initial FCC proposal stemmed from a recommendation by an advisory panel that included representatives from the entertainment, broadcast, electronic and computer industries. The plan took more than eight years to develop.
The negotiations were initiated after a request last month from Commissioner Ness. She set a Nov. 25 deadline for the negotiators to reach agreement, although the date was not legally binding.
"
40,"Ameritech Corp. won an important endorsement Wednesday from Michigan regulators in its bid to become the first Baby Bell to offer long-distance telephone service from its local calling region.
The Michigan Public Service Commission voted to advise the Federal Communications Commission that it appears Ameritech has met a 14-point checklist for opening its local phone network in the state to new competitors -- such as AT&amp;T Corp. and other companies wanting to offer local phone service.
That checklist was spelled out under last year's big communications law as a condition for local carriers to offer long-distance service from their regions.
""We're extremely disappointed with this decision. It seems to ignore the overwhelming evidence that Ameritech faces no viable local telephone competition in Michigan,"" said an AT&amp;T spokesman. An Ameritech spokesman was not available.
The FCC will make the final determination on whether Ameritech has indeed met the technical checklist for entry into the $78 billion long-distance market.
But a negative review from Michigan would have dimmed the Chicago-based carrier's prospects considerably. The Justice Department must issue a recommendation to the FCC by Feb. 21.
Ameritech asked the FCC on Jan. 2 for permission to provide long-distance service to residents in Michigan, one of five Midwestern states in which the company provides local phone service. Ameritech has 3.5 million customers in Michigan.
Long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp. have called on regulators to reject Ameritech's request, saying the company has not yet opened its local market fully to competitors.
The Michigan commission said that in a 2-1 vote among commissioners the agency authorised the filing of its comments in the Ameritech case with the FCC.
""For many years, the Michigan Public Service Commission has supported allowing expanded choice for telephone customers,"" said commission Chairman John Strand.
""Our comments today are designed to assist the Federal Communications Commission to follow a course that will introduce more competition in the telecommunications marketplace.""
After filing its initial request with the FCC, Ameritech was forced to amend its application with an additional 1,500 pages of documents. Regulators had determined that many needed pages were missing.
Other Baby Bells are expected to ask the FCC for similar approval soon.
"
40,"The television industry's controversial system for rating programs is set to begin airing Wednesday on the big networks ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.
Broadcast and cable networks will carry the ratings, though start dates will vary. Time Warner Inc.'s upstart WB network began rating shows on Dec. 22. Cable network Black Entertainment Television does not plan to use the ratings.
Following are questions and answers about the system, unveiled by TV and Hollywood executives on Dec. 19.
Question: What are the ratings?
Answer: There are six categories, with two for children's shows. Like the 28-year-old motion-picture industry ratings, the TV ratings are meant to show a program's suitability for kids of different age groups. In general, they are:
TV-Y  -- Children of all ages.
TV-Y7 -- Children seven and older.
TV-G  -- Suitable for all ages.
TV-PG -- Parental guidance suggested.
TV-14 -- Parents of children under 14 strongly cautioned.
TV-M  -- Mature audiences only.
Q: How about some examples?
A: Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s CBS issued these ratings: ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" TV-Y7; the Rose Bowl parade, TV-G; ""Touched by an Angel,"" TV-PG; and ""Chicago Hope,"" TV-14.
Walt Disney Co.'s ABC offered the following: ""Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show,"" TV-Y; ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" TV-G; ""Lois and Clark,"" TV-PG; and ""NYPD Blue,"" TV-14.
General Electric Co.'s NBC will broadcast the Holocaust movie ""Schindler's List"" in February with a TV-M rating. And News Corp.'s Fox said the year's first episodes of ""Melrose Place"" and the ""X-Files"" will be rated TV-14.
Q: What are prime-time shows likely to receive?
A: Networks expect most will carry a middle-of-the-road TV-PG. But a show's rating can vary from episode to episode.
Q: Where will the ratings appear?
A: They will be displayed briefly as a small icon in the upper-left corner of the TV screen at the start of a show. Newspapers, TV Guide and cable publications and on-screen listing services are expected to publish the guidelines.
Q: Are all shows affected?
A: No. News and sports programs are exempted. All other programs, including cartoons and talk shows, will be rated. Each local TV station will have the final say over whether a show is rated and what rating it will receive.
Q: Who will rate the programs?
A: Networks and producers will rate their own shows, unlike the movie industry, where an independent panel made up of parents rates films. TV executives contend they have far more programs to rate, with up to 2,000 hours a day of shows.
Q: What's been the public's reaction?
A: Mixed. The ratings have drawn flak from some lawmakers, parent groups, children's advocates, educators and others. These groups say the new system does not go far enough.
They favor a system that also would specify violence, sex and foul language, using letters such as V, S and L. An example: V-PG for a program in which parental guidance is suggested because of violent scenes.
Q: What do the critics plan to do?
A: They will ask the Federal Communications Commission to reject the industry's plan. And they want the industry to test the two approaches side by side in the home.
Q: What's the industry's response?
A: It will not participate in such a test. Executives also argue their system ""mingles"" age and content. For example, the system notes a TV-14 show may contain ""sophisticated themes, sexual content, strong language and more intense violence.""
Q: What is the origin of the ratings?
A: They stem from the communications law enacted in February that requires new TV sets to include a ""V-chip."" The technology, expected to be available in a year or so, will be used with the ratings to allow parents to block certain shows.
Q: What is the FCC's role?
A: The FCC must set up an advisory panel to devise a new system if the agency considers the industry plan unacceptable.
Q: Would the industry use such an alternative?
A: No. It has vowed to fight any government-imposed plan in court on First Amendment grounds.

40,"Negotiations between American Airlines and its pilots union continued into the early hours of Friday, with neither side reporting any breakthrough that would avert a midnight strike at the nation's No. 2 carrier.
A federal mediator refereeing the talks at a downtown hotel informed the pilots that American had rejected a key union contract proposal covering who should pilot -- and at what pay -- the carrier's smaller American Eagle planes.
Mediators are shuttling back and forth between the two sides offering hypothetical ""what if"" proposals on a variety of issues in an effort the bring the two sides closer together and prevent a midnight Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) strike by the pilots which would throw the nation's air transport system into turmoil.
""They're going to work all night, throughout the night. All day (Friday),"" said Dave Bates, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,000 pilots.
He said the union is ""disappointed at the lack of progress"" so far.
""We will continue to negotiate for as long as it takes. But (Friday) night at midnight the pilots will be on strike.""
Bates said no face-to-face talks had as yet been scheduled. An American spokesman would only say that the negotiations were continuing.
Going into the talks on Thursday evening, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said he was hopeful an agreement could be worked out in time to avert a strike.
The union had proposed that its pilots fly the American Eagle flights, but with lower pay than pilots flying the regular American aircraft. American, however, wants to continue using lower-paid commuter pilots from a different union to fly the smaller planes.
While the mediator has informed the union of the airline's rejection of the proposal on small planes, union officials said the company itself has not notified them directly of that.
The dispute also centres around the pilots' pay. They now earn an average of about $120,000 a year.
The union earlier had said it would offer a new pay proposal -- probably less than the 11.5 percent over four years it had sought. The latest reported offer from American was a 6 percent boost over four years.
A strike would ground 2,200 American flights on Saturday and affect about 200,000 passengers. American, a unit of AMR Corp., accounts for about 20 percent of the nation's airline capacity.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is trying to rebook passengers on other carriers and has already cancelled nearly all international flights scheduled for Friday night.
American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said on Thursday the carrier was cancelling 12 of its domestic flights scheduled for Friday. ""There are some small domestic airports where we have no permanent place to park the planes if there is a strike, so we decided to cancel those 12 flights.""
A Transportation Department official said a strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $200 million a day.
American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called for binding government arbitration of the dispute, a proposal the pilots have repeatedly rejected.
""I think mandatory binding arbitration should be required"" to prevent airline strikes, Crandall told a congressional subcommittee. Binding arbitration would mean both parties agreed to abide by the decision of an arbitrator.
""I seriously doubt we could accept that,"" union spokesman Wally Pitts said.
Crandall told a hearing of a House of Representatives Transportation subcommittee he was unsure if a strike could be avoided. ""We have two choices: we can either cave in or take a strike. A strike of 90 days will destroy this airline.""
As the talks entered their fourth day of intensive bargaining, President Bill Clinton was keeping a close watch.
Clinton could intervene and name an emergency board to try to resolve the issues. Under the Railway Labour Act, which also covers airlines, the president has the power to declare a national emergency to stop a strike and to keep planes flying for 60 days. The last time such an action was taken in an airlines strike was in 1966.
But at an unrelated news conference on Thursday, Clinton repeated that the parties should use the government mediator to reach an agreement.
"
40,"Regulators are set to kick off a two-part plan to slash rates on overseas phone calls, a move that could save American consumers and companies billions of dollars but ruffle the feathers of foreign governments.
The Federal Communications Commission is expected Tuesday to make it simpler for U.S. and foreign phone companies to negotiate cheaper packages for connecting international calls to and from the United States.
Next month the FCC is expected to propose rules to cut the charges U.S. carriers pay foreign phone monopolies to complete overseas calls made from U.S. shores. ""The ultimate goal is to get lower-priced and better-quality services for consumers,"" said Don Gips, head of the FCC's international bureau.
Officials say the foreign charges, or ""accounting rates,"" run five to 10 times actual costs, reflecting the power of state-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. Monopolies control more than 90 percent of the non-U.S. market.
U.S. phone companies, as a result, paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.  
""This figure would drop in half overnight if American carriers simply paid fees even vaguely related to costs,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in a recent speech. He noted that the imbalance dwarfs the U.S. foreign aid budget of $2 billion.
The United States has big imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Colombia and Argentina, among others.
""Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous"" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics.
U.S. carriers support the strategy. ""You've got to move accounting rates to cost,"" said AT&amp;T Corp Vice President Gerry Salemme. AT&amp;T said it must pay 45 cents a minute to have its calls connected to the Dominican Republic, but that the actual cost of the termination is 7 to 8 cents a minute.
The FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organization.
To cut rates and open markets, the FCC is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. Tuesday's order is meant for open markets, such as possibly those in Britain, Canada and Chile.  
The FCC will waive its ""proportionate return"" rules that limit the ability of U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate lower rates for terminating overseas calls. To win a waiver a foreign carrier's home market must be open to competition.
The existing rules require overseas companies to turn over their long-distance calls to U.S. carriers in the same proportion U.S. carriers send calls to a foreign carrier's home market. If AT&amp;T, for example, accounts for 60 percent of calls to a country, then that country's monopoly must hand off 60 percent of its U.S.-bound calls to AT&amp;T.
The FCC proposal due out next month would set ""benchmark"" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs. The agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.
""It literally has the potential of savings consumers billions of dollars,"" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
But the plan could rub governments the wrong way. High rates charged by their own phone monopolies can be used to maintain bloated payrolls or to subsidize local phone service.

37,"Signals from Hong Kong's likely future leader that the Chinese Communist Party might become legal in the territory in 1997 raised concerns in the pro-democracy camp on Wednesday about the party's future power.
Concern was stirred up after the man tipped as the favourite to become Hong Kong's chief executive, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, said on Tuesday he would accept the Communist Party's legalisation after the British colony reverts to China.
London is handing Hong Kong back at midnight next June 30, and Tung is the frontrunner to lead it after he received 51 percent of the votes in the first round of a ballot last week by the 400-member selection committee organised by China.
Although China is ruled by the Communist Party, Beijing has promised Hong Kong wide-ranging autonomy, leaving its capitalist system intact for 50 years under a policy of ""Hong Kong people running Hong Kong"" and ""one country, two systems"".
""The most important thing is, what will be the role of the Communist Party in Hong Kong after the handover, because whether it's legal or not it is here,"" legislator Emily Lau told Reuters.
Many people in Hong Kong have speculated that the future Chief Executive will be stage-managed by a Communist overlord from Beijing. China has publicly denied this is the plan.
Tung said on Tuesday in response to a reporter's question that he would accept the party's legalisation if asked to do so.
""That's totally unnecessary. It's already there,"" said Martin Lee, leader of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest.
The democracy camp is worried about what power, if any, the Communist Party might wield over Hong Kong, which is supposed to be administratively separate from the rest of China.
""Let's be realistic. China is dominated by the Communist Party and the Communist party already has an office here in the form of the Xinhua News Agency headed by Zhou Nan,"" independent lawmaker Christine Loh told Reuters.
""In the future after 1997 there is no reason to continue to pretend the Communist Party is not here,"" Loh said.
""But the problem is the Communist party isn't just an ordinary political party. In China it dominates the political and governmental institutions. So what we want to know is that its presence here would not represent interference,"" she said.
A Hong Kong security authority spokesman said the Communist Party is not legally registered in Hong Kong and, therefore, does not exist in the eyes of the law.
Hong Kong's colonial authorities outlawed all political parties. Since 1990, however, they have been allowed to register under the societies ordinance. As a result, parties such as Lee's Democrats are registered as societies.
But, ""The Communist Party is not registered under the societies ordinance and we've received no application from them for registration,"" chief government spokesman Kerry McGlynn told Reuters. He declined to comment further.
A government source said the government never talks about the issue in detail. ""When a politician raised the issue last year, the government's spokespersons just looked down and mumbled into their beards.""
""In terms of legalising it, I'm not aware that the Communist Party is actually illegal, but we know it's not legally constituted by being registered,"" Loh said.
In the past, the party was involved in violent conflicts with the colonial government, especially the Hong Kong riots of 1967 inspired by China's radical-left Cultural Revolution.
"
37,"China is poised to take a major step in reversing democratic reform in Hong Kong by creating a new legislature to replace the territory's elected body when Beijing resumes control of the British colony next year.
The die will be cast on Saturday when 400 Hong Kong people, carefully screened by China, meet over the border in the city of Shenzhen to appoint 60 legislators who will make Hong Kong's laws from July 1.
The ""provisional legislature"" will be installed after China disbands the elected Legislative Council (Legco) in a move to roll back political reforms introduced by Beijing's nemesis, departing colonial governor Chris Patten, since 1992.
The body that will choose the new parliamentarians is the Selection Committee, which also elected Tung Chee-hwa, a 59-year-old shipping tycoon with strong pro-Beijing loyalties, to succeed Patten as chief executive of the territory of 6.3 million people.
China resumes control of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 next year, ending more than 150 years of British rule.
The Hong Kong public, who voted resoundingly for pro-democracy groups in Legco elections last year, have had no vote in the two selection processes organised by China and no say in the decision to remove the elected legislature.
The Sino-British quarrel over the provisional legislature set Tung and Patten on a collision course this week.
""A quarter of those who are lining up for jobs in this institution were beaten in regular elections ... It will be a blot on the first months of Chinese rule,"" Patten told a newspaper. ""This echo chamber has no place in the political or administrative life of Hong Kong ... We will have nothing to do with it any form.""
Tung responded in a speech to the business community by saying Britain must ""face the reality"" of the new legislature. He warned that if its legitimacy was challenged further he would get China's parliament to legislate on its legality.
Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy group, the Democratic Party, is boycotting the selection process, which it brands as a plot to snuff out democracy and enact repressive laws.
""You won't find five of them who can be called democrats by any stretch of the imagination,"" Democratic Party leader Martin Lee told Reuters, commenting on the candidates.
The Democratic Party has expelled a rebel member, Dominic Chan, because he broke ranks to run for the new assembly.
The party is organising two days of protests against the provisional legislature, and China has beefed up security on the border in case demonstrators try to cross into Shenzhen, local media quoted Chinese sources as saying.
The Selection Committee will choose the 60 members of the provisional legislature from a list of 130 candidates.
Pro-Beijing parties fielding candidates denied critics' allegations this week that they had negotiated the result of the voting in advance in under-the-table horse-trading.
""There is definitely no carve-up of seats,"" said Liberal Party leader Allen Lee.
Each Selection Commitee member will vote by endorsing up to 60 names from among the candidates. The top 60 candidates -- those listed the most times -- will be appointed to the provisional legislature.
Among the candidates are 34 incumbent legislators, raising the prospect that Legco could be crippled well before Chinese rule, because the two legislatures' schedules could clash.
A poll by Hong Kong University indicated on Thursday that one-third of the public support the concept of the new legislature and one-quarter trust the Chinese government.
"
37,"Hong Kong shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa was rated by a poll on Thursday as the best man to deal with China as a Beijing-controlled committee grilled candidates vying to run the territory when Britain pulls out in 215 days.
Britain hands its colony back to Chinese sovereignty at the stroke of midnight next June 30, and the 400-strong Selection Committee is in the midst of a three-day vetting of Tung and two rivals bidding to succeed colonial Governor Chris Patten.
The winner will be announced on December 11.
The opinion poll, conducted among 967 people by the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Monday and Tuesday, showed Tung to be the favourite and indicated 73 percent of the respondents also believe Tung is the candidate who can communicate best with the Chinese government in Beijing.
Only 7.2 percent thought his rival, former chief judge Ti Liang Yang could commmunicate well with Beijing, while another candidate, businessman Peter Woo, scored only two percent.
Yang, however, was seen as being more impartial and as the man most ready to voice his opinion to China, the poll showed.
Asked who was most likely to speak out against Beijing, 31 percent said Yang, 20 percent Tung and 4.8 percent Woo.
After the first day's questioning of the candidates by the committee on Wednesday, Tung emerged as a better communicator than he has appeared on previous occasions, analysts said.
He produced a clearly focused vision for Hong Kong with the main thrust on putting business and economic interests first.
During the quizzing by committee members representing Hong Kong's business community, Tung blasted the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, urging it to drop its anti-China stance and to play a positive role in the transition for the sake of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.
""At present they are objecting to anything Chinese,"" Tung said. ""This is not good in the long term or for the interests of Hong Kong,"" he said. ""They should not think in this way.""
The Democrats are boycotting the Selection Committee, condemning its mission to pick Hong Kong's post-colonial leader as undemocratic and its activity to assemble a new provisional body to supplant the present elected legislature as a violation of handover pledges made by China.
Tung, delivering his policy platform in a speech to the body, outlined a new era in which he would pack his advisory cabinet with specialists and include legislators -- now excluded from the equivalent colonial body.
He also said he would like to retain all the senior local officials of the civil service in sign that he might keep on the present and highly regarded Chief Secretary Anson Chan.
Among his policy initiatives, Tung listed the revival of manufacturing industries, especially with a high-tech focus.
In recent years manufacturing has shifted out of Hong Kong to cheaper locations in mainland China, and Hong Kong has become a service-based economy.
Tung also said he wanted to boost the role of provident funds and social security. He said he would press for faster approval of construction plans, the sale of public housing to tenants at affordable prices, the release of more government land for housing, and a reduction of red tape.
He said he had a sense of mission to work for Hong Kong's good. ""My father C.Y. Tung had always taught me to do meaningful things and to be proud of being a Chinese,"" he said. ""It is this sense of mission that drives me.""
"
37,"In an exercise dubbed by China as a ""democratic election with Hong Kong characteristics"", this bustling territory goes to the polls on Friday. But only 400 citizens out of 6.3 million people in the colony will be voting.
A 400-member Selection Committee formed under Beijing's tight rein will be inaugurated in Hong Kong with a month-long mission to elect the first post-colonial leader and the 60 members of a replacement legislature.
The committee, to be anointed by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on his first official trip to the colony, will set the tone of the government to rule Hong Kong after Britain hands its Asian pearl back to China at midnight next June 30.
Hong Kong, one of Asia's economic wonders, is to become a Special Administrative Region of communist-ruled China. Beijing has pledged to maintain the territory's thriving capitalist system intact for 50 more years under the terms of China's ""one country two systems"" reunification policy.
Pro-democracy legislators attacked the leadership candidates in a debate on Wednesday for failing to address issues of human rights and democracy and called for a real general election.
Trade unionist Lee Cheuk-yan told Hong Kong's existing legislature that a leading contender, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, was dangerous.
""Mr Tung is the most conservative among them, and he is the most dangerous as he calls on Hong Kong people to be willing to be obedient citizens,"" Lee said.
But a motion critical of the leadership selection was defeated by the pro-Beijing camp. Several democrats were absent on a lobbying mission to London.
""Democratisation is not like instant noodles... It took hundreds of years for Western countries to develop their present democratic systems,"" pro-Beijing legislator Ip Kwok-him said.
The sovereignty transition has been frought with disputes between China and Britain, between colonial governor Chris Patten and Chinese envoys, and between Hong Kong's burgeoning democracy movement and a pro-Beijing political camp.
They have sparred over the future of Hong Kong's human rights, democracy and basic freedoms, over whether or not the commercial ""level playing field"" will continue, and over the survival of Hong Kong's autonomy and the rule of law.
But now, 229 days before the sun finally sets on Britain's empire in Asia, attention is shifting to who will be running the show for China after Patten sails away.
In the first round of the process on Friday, the Selection Committee members will propose candidates for the chief executive who will step into Patten's shoes next year.
To enter the final run-off for the job, a candidate must be nominated by at least 50 members of the committee on Friday. The committee meets again on December 11 to pick the winner.
The leading candidates are all acceptable to China, sources close to the committee say.
In the forefront of the leadership battle are Tung and former chief judge Ti Liang Yang. An opinion poll gave Yang a 10 percentage point lead over Tung in public popularity this week.
Businessman Peter Woo and former appeals judge Simon Li came a remote third and fourth, and four other little known candidates scored less than one percent in the public's ratings.
However, it is not the public who vote, but the committee, and inside that body the real lobbying campaign is unfolding.
""We have a process which is laid down and I think it's clear the polls don't determine the winner,"" said Woo.
The committee was formed in Beijing two weeks ago and is dominated by pro-Beijing political and business groups.
"
37,"The United States' top diplomat on Asia drew flak from leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp on Wednesday as he met key officials and politicians on the colony's 1997 return to China.
The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord had separate meetings with local political parties and with China's top official in the British colony, Zhou Nan.
Lord was also set to meet colonial Governor Chris Patten and his deputy, Anson Chan, as well as the man tipped as Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader, shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa.
Pro-democracy parties criticised Lord for planning to see only one of the three candidates in the China-controlled contest to select a post-colonial successor to Patten -- tycoon Tung.
""He has adopted the conventional wisdom that Tung will be chief executive and that the other two have no chance,"" said legislator Emily Lau of the pro-democracy group, Frontier.
Lau said she was not invited to meet Lord. The democracy camp has accused China of preordaining Tung as winner of the contest, which will culminate on December 11, and some critics say Lord's meeting with him is helping to pick the victor.
""What's the point in seeing the others when there's only one who will become the chief executive-designate of Hong Kong,"" one U.S. diplomat admitted to a reporter on Wednesday.
Lau said U.S. politicians no longer followed up remarks supporting human rights and democracy with action, and that they were now interested only in making money out of China.
""If they cared about human rights and democracy they should have cancelled Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent visit to China, to send Beijing a strong signal,"" Lau said.
But Christopher went there -- just one week after China had jailed leading dissident Wang Dan, she said. The U.S. has said it hopes to see Hong Kong keep its freedoms after 1997, but has stopped short of condemning Chinese plans to crimp democracy.
Legislator Yeung Sum, vice-chairman of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, said his party had told Lord of its worries about the future of press freedom, the elected legislature and the undemocratic nature of the post-1997 leadership contest.
His party had told Lord that a Chinese plan to dissolve the elected Legislative Council next July 1 and install a new provisional legislature was illegal, Yeung told reporters.
""It's a step back as far as democracy is concerned,"" Yeung said, branding the provisional legislature move a breach of the Sino-British treaty covering the sovereignty transfer.
Lord said Washington would continue to take a keen interest in Hong Kong after the change of flag at midnight next June 30.
""I'm here essentially for two reasons. One, to underline the United States' strong interest in a smooth reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, and secondly I'm here to listen, and I'm listening to a wide spectrum of views,"" Lord told reporters.
Lord was to hold a news conference on Thursday.
On Wednesday, he heard not only the views of the democrats but also politicians who oppose some of Britain's latest moves.
Before meeting Lord, the chairman of the Liberal Party, Allen Lee, said he would stress his opposition to the colonial government's decision last week to put forward a liberal new anti-subversion law without China's agreement.
""Mr Patten, knowing that the chief executive will be selected next week, gazetted last Friday a bill, without the agreement not only from the chief executive-designate, but also from the Chinese government,"" Lee said.
""I think this is totally irresponsible. He is playing politics, and he doesn't deserve to be the governor of Hong Kong,"" he said.
"
37,"Britain has suggested going to the World Court over China's plan to disband Hong Kong's elected legislature when Beijing takes back the territory next July.
The spectre of the two countries slugging it out in the International Court of Justice in the Hague raised the drama of Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule to a new level after many months of bitter wrangling on handover arrangements.
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten denounced China's plans on Friday and proposed letting the World Court rule on the dispute.
After more than 150 years of British rule, the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people falls back under the Chinese flag at midnight next June 30, with promises from Beijing's communist leadership that almost nothing will change.
At that moment, a Beijing-appointed legislature will take over from the elected Legislative Council (Legco), reversing democratic reforms introduced by Patten over the past four years.
""There is no justification for China to replace a legislature elected openly and fairly by more than one million Hong Kong people,"" Rifkind said in London.
""China should be prepared to trust Hong Kong people with the measure of democracy we have introduced.""
He summoned Chinese ambassador Jiang Enzhu, the man tipped to be China's envoy in Hong Kong next July, to underline Britain's concern.
Separately, Patten said in a statement and in an interview with Reuters that the body planned by China would be a ""rubber stamp"" chamber that would simply echo Beijing.
The threat of World Court action came on the eve of a vote by 400 wealthy and influential Hong Kong people picked under China's supervision to elect the provisional legislature.
Pro-democracy groups staged scattered protests in Hong Kong and jeered committee members as they left for the Chinese frontier city of Shenzhen where Saturday's meeting takes place.
""The International Court of Justice will, I'm sure, be able to sort things out, and we'd be very happy to put our arguments to them,"" Patten told Reuters.
""Clearly this weekend is going to be a very disagreeable one,"" Patten said, adding that China might ""trash an institution"" but it could not ""stamp out the spirit of democracy"" in Hong Kong.
Protesters mounted small-scale demonstrations outside China's diplomatic mission in the colony and at the Hung Hom railway station where members of the Selection Committee were boarding trains for Shenzhen.
""It is totally unacceptable,"" said lawmaker Emily Lau, who joined in the protests. ""There is no legal and constitutional basis for that body, and also the Chinese government is using that body to kick out people who they do not like.""
Patten said that despite Britain's views on the legislature, he would meet Hong Kong's post-colonial leader-designate, 59-year-old shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, to explore ways to cooperate on building the post-handover administration.
The quarrel over the legislature set Tung and Patten on a collision course this week. Tung lashed back in a speech to the business community, saying Britain must ""face the reality"" and warned that if the legislature were challenged he would get China's parliament to pass a resolution making it legal.
Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy group, the Democratic Party, is boycotting Saturday's selection process, which it brands as a plot to snuff out democracy and enact repressive laws.
""You won't find five of them who can be called democrats by any stretch of the imagination,"" Democratic Party leader Martin Lee told Reuters, commenting on the candidates.
"
37,"Hong Kong's post-1997 leadership campaign has begun in earnest with all the top candidates for the job as the territory's chief executive stating their positions on key issues in recent days.
The latest was Sir Ti Liang Yang, who on Monday made several policy statements including support for China's controversial plan to scrap the British colony's elected legislature.
With Britain's withdrawal and Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule 245 days away, would-be contenders to succeed Governor Chris Patten as the territory's top executive have sharpened their policy positions and revved up their campaigns.
""I think we have a real race in the sense that there is no chosen candidate in this contest,"" political expert Michael DeGolyer said on Tuesday.
DeGolyer, who heads a study on transition issues at a Hong Kong university, dismissed speculation that China had decided the outcome in advance and said rival Beijing factions were backing different Hong Kong personalities in the race.
""It's pretty clear they are backing different candidates in this contest,"" DeGolyer told a Hong Kong radio talk show.
The four main contenders among 31 nominees are Yang, shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, businessman Peter Woo and ex-appeals court judge Simon Li.
Yang, who resigned as the territory's chief justice last month to vie for the chief executive slot, broke with government policy when he ended his silence on China's plans for the legislature, describing them as legal and necessary.
China plans to dissolve Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council (Legco) -- reversing Patten's democratic reforms -- and install an appointed ""provisional legislature"". Britain and Hong Kong's democratic camp hotly oppose the plan.
""In my view the provisional legislature has a legal basis and there is a necessity to establish it,"" Yang told reporters.
He said without it, there was a risk of a legal vacuum arising during the transition to Chinese rule.
But Yang rejected the idea of the new assembly operating in tandem with Legco in the run-up to the handover.
He also said the enactment of new laws on subversion and treason, to reflect the change of sovereignty, should be left to a future permanent legislature to handle.
Despite the campaign atmosphere, the territory's new leader will not be democratically elected but chosen by the secretive, Beijing-appointed Selection Committee, a panel of 400 people from Hong Kong that will make the choice next month.
The Beijing-controlled Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao on Tuesday called the process ""a democratic election with Hong Kong characteristics"", a play on China's label for its own political system, ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
Yang also said he was shedding his British knighthood and the corresponding title ""Sir"".
Over the past week all four front-runners have made clear they would not challenge China's tough line on key political issues such as the legislature, democracy, human rights and freedom of expression in Hong Kong.
"
37,"Hong Kong democracy activists staged a noisy protest on Monday after 134 politicians applied to join a Beijing-controlled assembly to replace the colony's elected legislature in mid-1997.
The rush to join the provisional legislature may cripple the colonial legislature in the twilight of British rule, political analysts said.
As a registration deadline expired on Monday, organisers said 134 people had applied, among them at least 33 members of the present elected Legislative Council (Legco).
Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight next June 30, and Beijing is steaming ahead -- in the face of British objections -- with a plan to replace the elected Legco on handover day with a provisional assembly, to be selected on December 21.
The territory of 6.3 million people now face the prospect of two legislatures during the final six months of British rule -- one elected, legal and active, and one a ""selected"", shadow chamber preparing post-1997 laws.
The number of seats on Legco and the new body is the same -- 60. Among 33 incumbent lawmakers who have applied are Legco speaker Andrew Wong, whose bid startled the political community last weekend and sparked fears that Legco could disintegrate.
Banner-waving pro-democracy activists on Monday caused chaos in the lobby of the building where registration took place, burning documents and scuffling with security men. ""Phoney election"", ""dictatorship in disguise"", protesters shouted.
""Cracks which have already emerged within the Legislative Council over the bid by some members for a seat on the provisional legislature will widen in the next six months,"" said political commentator Chris Yeung.
""When you have two bodies from which laws emanate at the same time, there's going to be some confusion and dispute,"" said analyst Michael DeGolyer of Hong Kong's Baptist University.
Seat seekers for the new chamber include at least 11 former lawmakers and 22 former election contestants defeated in 1995 elections won by pro-democracy groups.
Those who lost 1995 elections include prominent pro-Beijing politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Peggy Lam and Elsie Tu.
Applicants include at least 47 newcomers to legislative contests, many of whom are members of the hand-picked 150-member Preparatory Committee crafting the post-1997 Hong Kong power structures on behalf of China's communist rulers.
Other newcomers are members of the 400-strong Selection Committee. This is the China-backed panel that will chose the first post-colonial leader on Wednesday, with the winner forecast to be conservative-minded shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa. The committee will also be responsible for selecting the provisional legislative body on December 21.
Poll results issued on Monday by the independent daily Ming Pao showed Hong Kong people split over the body's legitimacy.
The poll showed 32 percent supporting it, 30 percent against, and 38 percent voicing no opinion.
Britain has condemned China's plan as reprehensible and unnecessary and has ruled out all cooperation with the body.
The Democratic Party, the largest in the Legco with 19 seats, is absent from all China-controlled transition bodies.
It has boycotted the selection process, branding the provisional legislature as undemocratic and illegal, and has vowed to challenge its legitimacy in court.
The threat has forced Beijing to consider locating the new legislature in mainland China until the handover.
"
37,"Two hundred days before its historic handover to China, Hong Kong has adopted a charismatic shipping tycoon as helmsman to lead it into the 21st century.
But the British colony of 6.3 million people is waiting to see if chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa can form a ""dream team"" with the territory's most popular public figure, ""iron lady"" Anson Chan, head of the present colonial Civil Service.
The former tycoon, who resigned from his shipping empire to become Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader, takes over from British Governor Chris Patten at midnight next June 30, when a century and a half of colonial rule comes to an end.
""If Tung can keep Anson in her job, we will have a dream team leadership that both Britain and the Hong Kong community will be happy with,"" a senior official said.
Tung, 59, selected by a Beijing-vetted electoral college to run the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, named Chan on Thursday as favourite to be his deputy, saying he wanted her to stay on as head of the 180,000-member civil service.
""I have said I hope she can remain at her post. She, too, has indicated she is willing to do so. I hope she can be my chief secretary,"" Tung said in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.
""I would like to see a smooth transition. I hope most of the senior officials can remain in office,"" he said.
Chan, 56, has signalled her interest in working for Tung but restated her fervent belief in libertarian values.
She praised Tung for urging Hong Kong to forget political squabbles and ""find common ground to build Hong Kong together"".
But she cautioned that the freedoms and plurality of views that made Hong Kong one of the world's economic marvels must be preserved, and said pragmatism and flexibility were vital to it.
""Its very success has been founded on tolerance of different viewpoints,"" she told the college gathering. ""I believe that the law was made for man, not man for the law, that government is the servant of the people, not their master.""
Of a similar age, Tung and Chan have much in common and have always described their relationship as friendly.
Both their families moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong as the Communists overran China, defeating the Nationalists in a long civil war that ended in 1949.
The contest for Hong Kong's handover leadership has been dominated by the Shanghai connection. The two candidates who lost to Tung -- former Chief Justice Yang Ti Liang and entrepreneur Peter Woo -- were also Shanghai-born.
Chan herself had earlier been touted as a leadership candidate, having emerged in the polls this year as Hong Kong's most popular political personality with more than 60 percent of public support. But she decided not to run against Tung.
The Shanghainese form one the greatest networks within Hong Kong. Tens of thousands of Shanghai people fled the Communist regime and relocated their businesses in Hong Kong after 1949.
The current leadership in China is also heavily dominated by the so-called ""Shanghai faction"" led by President Jiang Zemin, who has been actively promoting officials from his home area.
Tung, a conservative who was once bailed out by Chinese funds and who opposes conflict with Beijing, has evolved from a publicity-shy figure into a charismatic leader-in-waiting who can charm and quip his way through news conferences.
He shifts comfortably from one language to another -- English, Cantonese and Mandarin.
Chan is profoundly respected by civil servants for her no-nonsense, efficient administrative style, which has earned her a reputation for toughness -- tempered by a huge smile, kind heart and balanced political outlook.
""The question is whether it is too balanced. Beijing may reject her for defending democracy too much,"" the official said.
"
37,"The skyscrapers are decked with fairy lights. Red-cloaked Santas pat children on the head. Christmas carols ring out. It is Christmas in Britain's last major colony, but will it ever be like this again?
The most spectacular Christmas light displays in the world are strung from Hong Kong's skyscrapers, featuring giant illuminated Santas and reindeer covering entire facades, beaming a rainbow of colours along the famed Hong Kong harbour skyline.
Hong Kong -- shopping paradise of the world -- is awash with Christmas. Its glass and marble malls brim with exorbitant festive displays, its shops push the fanciest, most expensive brand names in the world, specially repackaged for the season.
But after Britain pulls out and Communist-ruled china takes over next July, what then?
Will Christmas turkey, Christmas pudding and Christmas cake be allowed to grace the yuletide dinner table? Even if it does, will it taste the same?
Will revellers pull Christmas crackers and drink themselves silly in merriment as many do today?
Will China allow bourgeois extravagance and Western customs? Will charities run their ""Operation Santa Claus"" fundraising drive for the disadvantaged and underprivileged? Will Christians be free to worship at Midnight Mass?
If China lives up to its promises, the answer to all these questions is a resounding ""yes"".
China has promised to allow Hong Kong to retain its freewheeling capitalist system for a further 50 years, as a quasi-autonomous part of the motherland under a ""one country two systems"" policy. This means freedom of religion will stay. And the hybrid cocktail of customs and traditions, too.
However, many of Hong Kong 6.3 million people worried that pro-democracy protests such as a Christmas Eve vigil and the mass dispatch of Christmas cards to mainland dissidents by human rights groups on Tuesday might not be allowed again.
It is also doubtful if Queen Elizabeth's Christmas broadcast will ever again be on Hong Kong public radio and television.""
Christmas is still going to be a holiday next year in Hong Kong, as is the other main Christian festival, Easter.
Only the Queen's official birthday and World War Two victory holidays are to be removed after China takes over.
And, in this overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese territory, there are more non-Chinese than ever, despite the gradual departure of expatriate colonial civil servants and company executives.
There are 37,000 Americans, 33,000 British and 30,000 Canadians, enough to keep a few Christmas parties going. The largest foreign group, 140,000 Filipinos, mostly brought in as servants, are also a strong Christian community.
Nevertheless, there are misgivings how much will remain the same in Hong Kong. And there's a whiff of melancholy and pre-nostalgia among expatriates this festive season.
It's almost like a ""last supper"", their minds tilted towards midnight next June 30, 1997, the moment when the British flag will be furled away here forever.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's annual ""Christmas Song Choice"", which will be aired on local radio, reflects the mood.
His selection starts with Louis Armstrong singing ""Basin Street Blues"", followed by ""As Time Goes By"" by Jimmy Durante.
Patten gathered his family and friends on Wednesday night, Christmas night, for a traditional dinner of roast turkey.
All assembled were aware it could be the last Christmas dinner in the regal Government House overlooking the harbour.
Patten's successor Tung Chee-hwa, who will be Hong Kong's first Chinese leader, has indicated he doesn't want to live in the mansion that symbolises Hong Kong's one and a half centuries of British colonial rule and 150-plus years of China's national shame. He says the residence is cramped and inauspicious.
So no more Christmas there, at least.
Hong Kong's final year as a British colony has seen the balance of power tilt into China's orbit, even before the change of flag arrives. Chinese influence waxed and Britain's waned.
However, just as Christmas has become a commercial success in Japan, the festival will inevitably live on -- Chinese-style.
Hong Kong Chinese vie with each other to lavish expensive presents on their children.
Even over the border in mainland China, Christmas shopping sprees are catching on. There, Santa Claus has taken to riding a rickshaw, instead of a sleigh.

3,"Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded relations.
""If the relations between the two sides are kept at a low ebb due to political and ideological problems... Taiwanese businessmen will lose confidence because of higher risks,"" said Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest investor in China.
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing earlier told the same seminar in Beijing no one could stand in the way of direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan which have been banned by the island since 1949.
Kao is heading a delegation of nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are visiting in a private capacity.
Kao called for the resumption of talks suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.
""I would like to suggest here... that the two sides resume as soon as possible talks on trade and investment,"" Kao said.
Taiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials during the current trip, which comes less than two weeks after President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.
Taipei's China Times Express newspaper said on Sunday that Taiwan's economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorated.
Li, the Chinese vice-premier, took a swipe at President Lee, saying no one could block direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan, rivals from the time of the Chinese civil war that ended in 1949.
""Economic development between the two sides is the general trend and no single person can obstruct this,"" Li said.
""Any person who tries to place artificial barriers to restrict economic cooperation is going against the will of the people of the two sides,"" he said.
He also told the seminar he hoped Taiwan authorities would allow direct links as soon as possible.
Indirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s, through Hong Kong or a third country.
Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport links. But Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.
China has been pressing Taiwan to open direct links. Last week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links.
The Taiwanese delegation is the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Taiwan President Lee's mid-1995 visit to the United States.

3,"China will defrock radical monks in Tibet in a crackdown that could last up to five years in a bid to uproot the influence of the Dalai Lama in his Himalayan homeland, a Chinese propaganda official said on Thursday.
""Lamas who are comparatively reactionary will be told to return to secular life,"" the propaganda official said by telephone from Tibet's capital, Lhasa.
""Reorganisation of monasteries... will consist mainly of ideological education... It could continue for three to five years,"" said the official, who declined to identify himself.
China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled god-king, in the region, saying religion must conform to socialism instead of the other way round.
Atheist China views religion as feudal superstition though it tolerates a limited degree of religious freedom.
""Religious culture... not only hampers social development and economic development, but also stops people becoming more civilised,"" the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.
The newspaper complained last week that monks in Tibet outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings.
""Monasteries will not be closed... (but) work teams will enter and be stationed at monasteries,"" the propaganda official said.
For several months, China has been stationing ""work teams"" in Tibetan monasteries. The teams force monks into study sessions on becoming more ""patriotic"" and into signing pledges supporting Chinese authorities.
""Those aspects of religion which fail to adapt to social development and impede social progress will be eliminated... to prevent the Dalai Lama from using religion to engage in splittist activities,"" the official said.
There were 1,787 temples in Tibet by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the Tibet Daily has said.
The newspaper has complained that healthy young Tibetans were entering the clergy and living off alms instead of working.
China has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to try to eradicate the influence of the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.
The Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.
Beijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure.
""The spiritual realm is the main battlefield of our struggle against the Dalai Lama clique,"" the Tibet Daily said.
The newspaper said last week some temples in Tibet were controlled by supporters of the Dalai Lama and had become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad to engage in separatist activities.
It blamed monks and nuns for creating disturbances and sabotaging stability since 1987. Tibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by the Dalai Lama's supporters.
"
3,"China has retired its navy and air force commanders due to old age, a source familiar with the reshuffle said on Tuesday.
Admiral Zhang Lianzhong and Lieutenant General Yu Zhenwu, both 65, have stepped down as navy and air force commanders respectively, said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Zhang was replaced by navy deputy commander Rear Admiral Shi Yunsheng, 56, the source said. Yu was succeeded by air force deputy commander Liu Shunyao, believed to be in his early 50s.
Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin approved the reshuffle in October in his capacity as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, or commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the source said.
Asked if the reshuffle was intended to further consolidate Jiang's power in the military, the source said Zhang and Yu retired due to old age.
""It's professionalisation of the military,"" the source said.
However, a Chinese analyst said the four vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission were already aged between 67 and 82 and still active. The two youngest vice-chairmen were appointed by Jiang.
Both the new appointees are believed to be proteges of Jiang, another analyst said. Jiang ordered the promotions of Shi and Yu to navy and air force deputy commanders in January, 1995 and December, 1994 respectively, the analyst said.
Some diplomats and Chinese analysts have dismissed Jiang as a transitional figure lacking the personal clout, political power base and administrative ability to step into the shoes of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after the death of the 92-year-old patriarch.
But Jiang, who has no military pedigree, has moved in recent years to shore up his position in the military with a string of reshuffles.
The PLA is the world's largest armed force with three million members.
It is believed to be planning to pare that number by 500,000 in a streamlining that reflects the end of the Cold War and a desire to redirect state funds to economic development.
"
3,"China announced on Thursday that a court had rejected the appeal by a son of one of the country's politically powerful families, upholding a suspended death sentence for bribery.
The court showed leniency to Zhou Beifang, 43, former chairman of Hong Kong-listed affiliates of the giant state-owned Capital Iron and Steel Corp (Shougang), because he showed remorse, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Zhou's death sentence was suspended for two years. Such suspensions usually mean the sentence will not be carried out if the prisoner repents and cooperates with authorities.
Zhou is one of China's so-called ""princelings"", or children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections.
The Zhou family has close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
The court also showed leniency because Zhou voluntarily returned ill-gotten wealth even before prosecutors obtained evidence against him, Xinhua said.
Zhou was convicted of accepting bribes totalling 9.28 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.2 million) between June 1993 and April 1994, Xinhua said. It gave no details of who paid Zhou the bribes or why.
He was also found guilty of paying 1.2 million yuan ($144,600) in bribes to three people, including two former officials of the Beijing city government, so that his wife and daughter could move to the British colony, it said.
Xinhua quoted the Supreme Court as announcing the decision though it was the appeals court that handed down the verdict.
The agency gave no explanation. It did not say when Zhou was convicted, when he appealed or why his appeal was turned down.
Court officials reached by telephone declined comment.
State television showed a grim Zhou wearing a stylish, striped blue shirt and examining documents held by a court policeman as a court tribunal looked on.
Zhou's conviction was part of a highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched by China last year. It led to the suicide of a Beijing vice-mayor in April 1995 and the fall of his mentor, former Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong.
Zhou's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age. He stepped down days after his son's detention.
The court also rejected the appeal of co-defendant Chen Jian, 39, former deputy director of the General Office of the Communist Party's Beijing Municipal Committee. It upheld his 15-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from Zhou, Xinhua said.
Another former official of the Beijing city government, Li Min, did not appeal against his sentence of life imprisonment, also for accepting bribes from Zhou, the agency said.
In a related case, the court rejected the appeal of businessman He Shiping, who was sentenced to 16 years for accepting bribes. A fifth defendant, who was given five years in prison, did not appeal, it said.
Television showed lengthy footage that include Li staring at the floor and a dejected He Shiping wiping tears from his eyes.
Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949. But it has staged a comeback since economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago as living standards climb but at the cost of eroding party discipline.
"
3,"China's breakaway Catholic Church has ordained about 50 graduates of one of the country's biggest seminaries into the priesthood this year, clergy at the seminary said on Monday.
The new priests, five of whom were ordained on Sunday, were the first group of clergymen installed by the National Catholic Seminary since 1991, they said.
The officially authorised seminary in Beijing did not accept any new students for six years from 1986 due to a lack of funds and space, the clergymen said.
""It's a big problem. Funds are too limited,"" a priest surnamed Meng told Reuters by telephone.
The seminary receives 10,000 yuan ($1,200) a year from the government, or one-sixth of its annual budget, another priest said. It raises the rest from donations.
Father Meng, who graduated in 1991, said there was no shortage of youths, many of them poor, who wanted to become priests.
He and other priests denied that government pressure had played a role in the lack of new students between 1986 and 1991.
Catholics in communist China are allowed to worship openly only if they belong to the state-sponsored Catholic Patriotic Association.
The association, which supervises the national seminary, appoints its own bishops and does not recognise the Pope as universal Catholic leader.
The official church has the blessings of the Communist Party but it too must walk a fine line between the demands of the party elite and the needs of the faithful.
The Washington-based Human Rights Watch/Asia has said Beijing has been stepping up harassment of unauthorised Catholic and Protestant groups in recent years.
The group said the crackdown on Christians included stricter controls on contacts with foreigners and was part of a broader drive begun in 1994 against all forms of religion as well as political dissent.
Bishop Zong Huaide of the state-backed church ordained five graduates of the seminary on Sunday. Zong delivered mass at the Church of the Holy Saviour, built in 1703, which was packed with about 3,000 people.
China has 31 seminaries and about 1,100 priests, 700 of whom are state-anointed young men.
The official Catholic Church in China counts four million members, while the underground church is believed to have several million members.
Vatican relations with Beijing have alternately cooled and warmed over the decades since the late 1950s, when links were severed over the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan.
China has said it will not normalise relations until the Vatican severs its ties with Taiwan, which Beijing has regarded as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
The Vatican, on the other hand, has demanded recognition of the Pope's primacy before it renews ties with China.
"
3,"China on Thursday savoured its latest victory in a diplomatic tug-of-war with Taiwan, while the stunned island scrambled to limit the damage from South Africa's decision to abandon it.
South African President Nelson Mandela said in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997.
Beijing hailed the move, saying it was in South Africa's interest.
""We ...welcome President Mandela's positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing in Beijing.
""If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interest to do so,"" Cui said.
Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs.
South Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People's Republic on the mainland.
The Chinese government spokesman said the People's Republic was the sole, legitimate government of all China.
""South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan,"" Cui said.
Wealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan was stunned by Mandela's announcement and scrambled to limit the damage by urging its 29 other allies not to be swayed by China.
""We hope such a situation won't affect our diplomatic relations with other countries...,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister John Chang said in a televised news conference in Taipei.
""We will actively negotiate with South Africa in the next 12 months,"" Chang said, adding that he might visit South Africa before an official visit scheduled for January.
South Africa's Ambassador to Taiwan Johannes Viljoen urged the island not to exact reprisals against Pretoria.
But Taiwan's top economic planner said the island would not continue to encourage investment in South Africa.
Tuntex, one of the island's major business groups, said earlier on Thursday it would respect the government's wishes in deciding whether to move ahead with a planned $3 billion petrochemical project in South Africa.
Taiwan officials said they would conduct an overall review of Taiwanese investments in South Africa, currently totalling over $1.5 billion.
South Africa's decision to switch ties to China sent Taiwan stocks into a brief dive, but the market had recovered by the close. Many businesssmen played down any potential for serious, long-term harm.
The Taiwan dollar closed little changed against its U.S. counterpart despite news of the island's diplomatic setback.
Taiwanese officials blamed China for South Africa's decision to ditch Taiwan, saying China was ""buying"" foreign ties and damaging chances for reunification between the longtime rivals.
There were no protests at Pretoria's embassy in Taipei, contrasting with the public outrage displayed in previous years after Washington, Seoul and other former allies dropped Taipei for Beijing.
"
3,"China sent a senior official to attend a reception at the Ukraine embassy on Friday despite a diplomatic rift over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan's vice president Lien Chan.
But an apparent guest list mix-up left both sides unsure over who would represent Beijing at the reception, held to mark Ukraine's independence day.
Ukraine's ambassador thought Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei would attend, but the Chinese thought it was Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang.
Zhang, however, fell ill and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan showed up instead.
The confusion followed Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan's three-day trip this week to Ukraine which infuriated Beijing.
""It was a misunderstanding...a mix-up,"" Ukrainian Minister-Counsellor Leonid Leshchenko told Reuters, referring to the guest list.
Asked if he saw it as an intentional slap on the wrist, Leshchenko shook his head and said: ""No, no no.""
A Chinese Foreign Ministry protocol officer said Tian, the vice-minister that the Ukrainians were expecting, was abroad.
Ukrainian diplomats noted that Tang, the vice-minister who attended, was filling in for Tian as the acting first vice-minister and was actually higher in rank than the person who fell ill.
Ukraine's Ambassador Anatoly Plyushko emerged from a half-hour chat with Vice-Minister Tang, and said the vice-minister told him that China attached ""great attention to bilateral relations"" and ""hoped to continue to develop"" ties.
Plyushko said the vice-minister did not raise the issue of Lien's three-day Kiev visit.
""All Chinese guests...invited came,"" Plyushko said. ""This is evidence...(of) their attitude towards our relations. I'm optimistic.""
The atmosphere was less pleasant on Wednesday when the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned Plyushko to protest against Lien's trip.
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province with no right to conduct foreign relations on its own, and has sought to push it into diplomatic isolation since a civil war separated them in 1949.
The former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China but not Taiwan.
In apparent retaliation against Lien's visit, Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has postponed a visit to Ukraine.
In Kiev, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko took a shot at Beijing on Thursday, saying China had over-reacted to Lien's visit and calling Beijing's protest ""out of proportion"".
"
3,"The father of Chinese dissident Wang Dan protested his son's innocence on Wednesday, just hours before the start of the former student leader's trial, and said the family would not give in to the authorities.
""He is definitely innocent,"" Wang Xianzeng told reporters as he left his home to go to the court.
The trial of Wang Dan, 27, on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government was due to begin on Wednesday morning at the Beijing People's Intermediate Court.
The public was effectively barred from the court, which was surrounded by police who had set up roadblocks across all major roads leading to the building.
""It just depends on whether the government wants to convict him or not,"" Wang Xianzeng told reporters.
""I'm not optimistic about the results... We will definitely appeal... We will not give in,"" he said.
""Speech can't overthrow the government,"" he said.
The court charges against Wang say that his writings in foreign publications are part of evidence to back up the charge that he had tried to overthrow the government.
His mother, Wang Lingyun, said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty to the capital charge.
She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.
The former student leader, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.
His family found a lawyer willing to defend the dissident after being given just one day in which to do so.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.
The mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he was detained in May 1995.
Human Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.
""The fact is that China's urban dissident movement...has in effect been comprehensively smashed,"" it said in a statement.
""At least where political dissidents are concerned, all the judicial signs thus far point...to intensified repression by the country's state security forces,"" it said, calling for a freeze on trade missions from the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.
Wang's court appearance was expected to resemble the in-camera proceedings last December against Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.
"
3,"A Chinese court on Friday took 10 minutes to reject the appeal of dissident Wang Dan and uphold an 11-year prison sentence for subversion, his mother said.
The verdict came four days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who diplomats say was expected to raise human rights issues in his meetings with Chinese leaders during his visit.
Angry family members staged a one-hour sit-down protest in front of the Beijing Higher People's Court after the court rejected Wang's appeal against his conviction, she said.
""It (the verdict) was all prepared in advance,"" Wang Lingyun told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""I'm very angry. It was very unfair,"" she said. ""The (appeals) court just copied the verdict of the first trial.""
The 27-year-old dissident was not allowed to speak at his appeal hearing as a judge read from a brief, prepared statement, the mother said.
Wang was convicted of plotting to subvert the government by publishing articles in foreign publications and receiving funds from hostile overseas organisations.
The mother said she would petition the appeals court but that it would be a formality and would not involve the court holding another trial.
Court officials, reached by telephone, declined comment. The tightly-controlled state media made no mention of Wang's conviction.
Police earlier kept reporters away from the court building, the family's home and nearby subway stations.
The dissident, wearing a red sweater and grey suit, appeared in low spirits and poor health, the mother said.
""(But) he was psychologically prepared. It came as no surprise. He does not have any illusions about them (the authorities),"" she said.
The former student leader had already served four years in prison for his role in student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the army in 1989.
The U.S. secretary of state, scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, was likely to bring up human rights when he meets Chinese leaders.
Sino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by issues ranging from human rights to Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade.
Beijing has slammed Western criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.
Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said in Beijing on Thursday that the world was dismayed by harsh sentences slapped on Wang and fellow dissident Wei Jingsheng, the father of China's modern democracy movement.
The jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.
China has said Wang's trial last month by a lower court was open and fair but the New York-based Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.
Human Rights in China has denounced the trial as a ""secret trial"" on a trumped up charge. The lower court took less than four hours to convict and sentence Wang on October 30.
"
3,"China said on Friday that Taiwan was a pawn and toy of hostile Western forces out to weaken and divide the country and thwart its development.
""Taiwan...acts as a pawn of international anti-Chinese forces, a toy in the hands of others,"" said a front-page commentary in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper.
The commentary, issued to mark the 25th anniversary of Beijing's ousting of Taipei from the United Nations, accused Taiwan of collaborating with forces hostile towards China to try to regain admission to the world body.
""Some Western forces have ceaselessly played the 'human rights card', 'Tibet card' to limit China's development,"" the commentary said.
""They see the Taiwan issue as one of their trump cards -- an important means of weakening and dividing China,"" it said without naming any countries but implying the United States.
In September, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a non-binding resolution supporting Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the United Nations, enraging Beijing.
China, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, maintains that the issue was settled once and for all in 1971 when Taipei was replaced by Beijing at the United Nations.
The commentary said countries that have helped Taiwan with its bid to regain admission to the United Nations were shortsighted like ""rats which can only see an inch in front of their eyes"".
It urged Taiwan's allies, mainly Central American, African and Caribbean countries, to stop ""foolish activities in the interest of others"".
For the fourth consecutive year, China and its supporters blocked moves in the General Assembly in September to consider U.N. membership for wealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan.
China considers any move to give Taiwan U.N. membership an encroachment on its sovereignty and an interference in its internal affairs.
Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and forced them to flee to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Beijing's communist rulers have sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation to force it into reunification. Almost 160 countries recognise Beijing, while 30 have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Both communist Beijing and capitalist Taipei agree to reunify one day, albeit on different terms. China has threatened to invade if the island declares independence.
The commentary said Taiwan's offer to give $1.0 billion to the United Nations on admission into the world body had become an ""international joke"".
It jeered at the argument that Taiwan deserved a seat as it was now democratic and economically prosperous, saying the island was ""deceiving others and itself"".
""No matter what political system Taiwan implemented or what level of economic development it attained...regaining admission to the United Nations would be purely a dream,"" it said.
"
19,"British opposition Labour party's plans for a one-off ""windfall"" tax on utility companies may be causing more stock market damage through uncertainty than the tax itself would, analysts said on Thursday.
If it won the next general election, due within six months, Labour has said it would levy a tax to reap excess profits from recently privatised utilities to help pay for welfare reform.
""The market does not like uncertainty -- give it a tax like this with no parameters and it will assume the worst-case scenario,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
As parliament prepared to debate the issue, at the prompting of the ruling Conservatives, analysts said if the Labour party would be more specific about plans, some of the uncertainty weighing on utility shares might lift.
""They have promised to raid the utilities but they have not said which, how much or when, and that is damaging,"" said Philip Hollobone, analyst at Williams de Broe.
Labour, which is well ahead in opinion polls, has said it would use the funds to tackle youth and long-term unemployment but has declined to set target companies, amounts or timeframes.
Newspaper reports have suggested the tax might be aimed at raising more than five billion pounds ($8.42 billion) and possibly as much as 10 billion pounds.
Speculation on possible targets has widened to include up to 30 companies, like British Telecom, British Gas and perhaps airport operator BAA Plc, in addition to the water and electricity companies initially pointed to.
Some of these, such as BAA, have already rehearsed arguments why they should not be included in any windfall tax net.
The water and electricity sectors, privatised around the start of the decade by the Conservatives, became unpopular after a spate of huge executive pay rises, hefty dividend payouts, and head-turning takeovers deals.
One analyst who declined to be named, suggested that the water sector stocks are currently undervalued by around five billion pounds, reflecting concerns over the tax.
Thames Water, for example, has underperformed the FT All Share Index by as much as 10 percent since late August, according Reuters Securities 3000 data, although its relative has improved recently to underperformance of some four percent.
Shares in regional electricity companies, however, were pulled in two directions as a resurgence of bids in the sector boosted speculation which analysts said may have offset some of the downside of a utility tax.
""The worries over the windfall tax are severely overdone...even if it does happen, most companies will be able to find the money, even if they do not want to,"" said Hollobone.
Along with several other analysts, he warns that even if Labour does win power it may not be able to effect the tax because of legal problems in ensuring it is non-discriminatory.
Several utility companies have said they would challenge any windfall tax plans in court, but Labour's treasury spokesman Gordon Brown described the proposal as ""legally iron tight.""
On Thursday, the Institute of Directors (IoD), which represents British business interests, warned against the tax although it acknowledged that ""some of the utilities do have spare funds at the moment.""
The IoD said the tax could lead to problems over who should pay what amounts and said customers might face increased prices.
The Conservatives have claimed the tax could mean an extra 192 pounds on the average household bill and challenged Labour to come up with figures to contradict this.
""Investors who are wise to the market's over-caution on the proposed tax are buying. These stocks are undervalued and...some are yielding more than long-term bonds,"" said one analyst.

19,"Britain's decision to take legal action to ban Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) on non-prescription medicines is likely to boost competition and could benefit some stores in terms of market share, analysts said on Friday.
""Anything that actually causes prices to fall is not good news (for retailers), but for those wanting to increase market share it will mean more people coming through the stores,"" said one share analyst who asked not to be identified.
Office of Fair Trading head John Bridgeman said in a statement earlier that he would seek to remove RPM from over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, because ""there are good reasons for believing that it is time to end price-fixing.""
RPM allows manufacturers to set minimum levels for sale of certain over-the-counter medicines. The Community Pharmacy Action Group, which lobbies on behalf of pharmacies, said its removal could mean the closure of one in four local outlets.
The OFT's request goes to the Restrictive Practices Court which is unlikely to be able to consider the issue before late 1997, Bridgeman told a press conference.
Retailers therefore did not appear to be about to start an immediate round of price cuts.
Chemist and beauty products store chain Boots said it was disappointed at the decision and believed that RPM ""operates in the public interest.""
Boots has not reduced prices of such medicines during a long-running inquiry into price-fixing and industry sources said it was unlikely to take that route in the near future.
UniChem, a pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer, said removal of RPM would be ""immaterial to...profitability,"" while Superdrug, the high street chemist chain owned by Kingfisher, welcomed the move but ruled out immediate price cuts.
Supermarket retailer ASDA, which has led the campaign over the last year to have RPM removed after successfully lobbying for it to be withdrawn from books, also welcomed the OFT's decision, saying it could save consumers 300 million pounds ($476 million) on everday healthcare products.
But it said its stance on prices would not change.
""RPM is still in place, we are still in the same situation we were in yesterday and we will still be in it tomorrow,"" a spokesman said.
ASDA is currently refusing to sell Anadin Paracetamol, a painkiller produced by Whitehall Laboratories, and large packs of indigestion treatment Alka Seltzer, after it baulked at manufacturers' price increases.
It has launched a range of some 40 own-brand OTC medicines and vitamins selling for as little as half the price of branded equivalents, and says they have helped it extend market share.
Also on Friday, ASDA said it was launching an initiative to help support local pharmacies, shops which chief executive Allan Leighton told BBC television he had no wish to see put out of business.
Share analysts said that removal of RPM on non-prescription medicines could see specialists such as Boots increasing market share, reflecting events after RPM was taken off books when specialist retailer W H Smith increased market share.
""Smiths got stronger, increasing market share through promotions and using muscle with suppliers. I expect the same will happen to Boots - it'll get bigger and stronger,"" said Nick Bubb of MeesPierson.
Boots shares dipped on the news and stood at 638-1/2p, down 5p, by 1440 GMT. ASDA was up a penny to 114-1/2 pence while Kingfisher was down 1-1/2 pence at 654 pence. ($1=.6298 Pound)

19,"Privatised nuclear power generator British Energy Plc sparked criticism on Wednesday when it announced job cuts that failed to impress the stock market and angered unions.
""I don't think this move transforms (British Energy's) prospects at all,"" said Philip Hollobone, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe.
British Energy said in a statement it aimed to cut 1,460 jobs in Scotland and Wales to make savings in staff costs of 50 million pounds ($78 million) within three years.
It said it would have a one-off restructuring charge of 100 million pounds which was already provided for.
Chief executive Robert Hawley said there could be more savings to come as cuts in office costs came through.
Union representatives slammed the move in a statement as ""a high risk strategy,"" warning that job cuts could ""reduce training, lower standards and threaten safety.""
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), part of Britain's Health and Safety Executive, said it would review the plans and take action if it felt safety would suffer.
""If we think (the plans) are adverse (for safety), we will use regulatory powers to stop (British Energy) doing them,"" a spokesman for the NII said.
But Hawley maintained that ""safety is our bottom line, not profit.""
British Energy's debut on the stock exchange in July was overshadowed by temporary closures of two of its eight reactors after cracks were discovered.
Shares kicked off below the partly-paid issue price of 105 pence to institutions and 100 pence to small investors and have rarely moved above those levels, mangaging just a half penny rise on the day on Wednesday to stand at 108 pence at 1130 GMT.
The ruling Conservative government pressed ahead with its privatisation despite the deep unpopularity of the deal and has been left with a stake of around 12 percent.
The opposition Labour Party also criticised the job cuts, which energy and industry spokesman John Battle said showed British Energy ""has not performed as they promised they would.""
He called on the company to confirm its dividend policy which it has said is vulnerable to underperformance by nuclear power stations.
Although Hawley maintained the company's plans were aimed at making ""absolutely sure we are competitive in the market place,"" analysts expressed concern it faced stiff challenges and remained an unattractive investment.
""They are under pressure,"" said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST).
Whiting said the crucial factor for British Energy was price of electricity in the so-called ""pool,"" or wholesale market.
""Pressure on electricity prices is downward in the medium to long term. (British Energy) has to address operating costs to get profits to stand still,"" he said.
Hollobone said the cost cuts should make predictions for dividend growth more secure but added that these were still below market averages.
""Dividend growth is one of the lowest in the sector and there is no sign of a special dividend,"" he said.
British Energy said at its privatisation that the first interim dividend would be 4.6 pence a share and forecasts for final dividend are for 9.1 pence in 1996/97.
""You can get better value elsewhere. Why invest in British Energy?"" Hollobone said. ($1=.6393 Pound)

19,"Entergy Corp on Wednesday called off talks with British regional electricity company (Rec) London Electric but the U.S. firm said it was still keeing an eye on the electricity sector, which has seen a recent flurry of bids and rumours.
In a statement responding to newspaper reports it planned a 1.2 billion pound ($2.02 billion) takeover of London Electric, Entergy said exploratory discussions had taken place but had been discontinued.
""We continue to evaluate attractive markets and investment opportunities worldwide and consider the UK electricity market to be in that category,"" Entergy spokesman Patrick Sweeney said.
Shares in London, which had surged higher on the bid reports, slipped to a low of 630 pence but later climbed back to 661-1/2 pence, down just 3-1/2 pence.
""What (Entergy is) saying is that the talks with London Electricity have ended. That doesn't mean they've ruled out a hostile bid for London Electricity, Yorkshire, or another,"" said Yamaichi analyst Nigel Hawkins.
Recent interest has seen two of the five remaining Recs attract U.S. predators -- Northern Electric is fighting CalEnergy's $1.225 billion bid and East Midlands has agreed to a $2.15 billion offer by Dominion Resources.
Seven of the original 12 cash-rich Recs have already been sold, three of them to U.S. companies which are attracted by the looser regulatory system in the UK.
Earlier this week, Entergy denied a report in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that it was interested in bidding for Yorkshire Electricity, considered the most attractive of the remaining Recs.
Southern Electric, which has so far kept out of this round of bid speculation, avoided takeover by British generator National Power when the government blocked the bid on competition grounds in April.
The company then went on to make an offer itself for its cousin Southern Water but was pipped by power company Scottish Power with a 1.68 billion pound bid.
The latest two bids for Recs are clouded by concerns that political pressures might prompt a block, however, as the ruling Conservatives struggle to catch the opposition Labour party's lead in polls before a general election due by May 1997.
The Recs, which were privatised by the Conservatives in 1989, have triggered sharp public and opposition party criticism for big dividends, bulging executive pay packets and bumper takeover prices.
But companies may well consider chances of an approval for takeover more likely with a Conservative government than from Labour, which already plans a ""windfall"" tax on utilities if it gains power.
""There's definitely a feeling that the window of opportunity is closing on these bids,"" said the sector analyst.
Analysts said there could be other U.S. companies looking at the sector, adding that Yorkshire Electricity remained one of the most attractive for a predator.
Industry watchdog Offer completed consultation on CalEnergy's bid on November 7 while the closing date for comments on Dominion's offer is November 22.
Trade secretary Ian Lang has a first deadline for deciding on CalEnergy's bid of November 25, analysts said, but might extend it to mid-December. ($1=.5950 Pound)

19,"The birth of a cable giant led by British Telecom's rival Cable &amp; Wireless should enliven competition and ease pressure on BT by regulators long worried by its dominance of the UK market, analysts said on Wednesday.
In its latest rebuff, telecommunications watchdog Oftel on Wednesday banned a promotion by BT, Britain's biggest telephone company, with satellite broadcaster BSkyB, due to a ban on BT's use of its network for entertainment.
""Oftel's decision is nuisance value for BT. (but) the Cable &amp; Wireless deal has far-reaching implications,"" said Patrick Hickey of Henderson Crosthwaite.
The merger announced on Tuesday created Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, a company controlled by C&amp;W that brings together its own Mercury telecoms business with the British operations of NYNEX of the U.S., Bell Canada International, and Videotron to create a $7.5 billion group. Its constituent companies already reach almost 2.5 million homes in Britain.
Following the Oftel decision, by 1230 GMT, BT shares were off 5.5 pence to 348.5 pence and BSkyB was off 17 pence to 661.5 pence, a low for the day, while C&amp;W was up 7.5 pence to 474.5.
Oftel said that BT's promotion, which involves discounts on subscriptions to BSkyB for customers using a ""Friends and Family"" phone charges offer, was discriminatory.
BT said it was ""baffled"" by Oftel's statement and claimed that the promotion offered cost savings to customers and was open to all BT users.
Oftel's decision is particularly emotive, analysts said, as it follows hot on the heels of its rivals' merger and despite active lobbying by BT to have the restriction on it offering television lifted.
BT welcomed the new Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, saying that it would help to create a market where ""competition can become the natural regulator.""
""The stronger Cable &amp; Wireless is perceived, the more Oftel will get off BT's back,"" suggested Tressan MacCarthy, analyst at Panmure Gordon. ""BT is likely to push hard and use this as an argument for letting them into the market,"" she added.
The Conservative government has stood its ground on BT's ban from cable television, saying there will be a review of the situation in 2001 with a possible early look in 1998.
The opposition Labour party, currently leading in polls ahead of a general election which must be held by May 1997, has linked opening doors for BT to connecting up schools to the Internet.
BT's promotion with BSkyB would have seen cost savings of around 90 pounds ($143.8) a year per customer in subscription discounts and credits to telephone bills, a BT spokesman said.
Analysts said customers also stood to benefit from the emergence of C&amp;W as a strong domestic competitor to BT.
""As the businesses are put together, say a year out, it will begin to have an impact on BT,"" said Hickey.
""It will be a pretty competitive environment,"" he added.
Cable &amp; Wireless Communications has around 2.47 million homes in its sights through a variety of franchises throughout the country and access to 18 million business and domestic telephone customers through its Mercury unit.
It will be offering not just cable television and telephony but also home shopping and Internet link-ups.
""It will be a more coherent competitor to BT, customers will feel more confident of one name instead of fractured franchising,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
For BSkyB, which is 40 percent owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, the new cable power could mean harder negotiations on programme pricing, analysts said.
""Cable &amp; Wireless Communications might feel it has more muscle to flex but BSkyB could see it as desperate for content; they both will need each other,"" Hickey said. ($1=.6260 Pound)

19,"British supermarket chain Safeway, known for cute kid adverts and innovative technology, turned in a seven percent rise in half year profits on Thursday and said sales were rising with hopes of a cheery Christmas.
""I am positive about Christmas, there are some good statistics on retail generally...I would hope that (consumers) would have more confidence to spend,"" chief executive Colin Smith said in an interview.
The company announced plans to open 450,000 square feet (41,810 sq metres) of extra space, or about 18 stores, in the next two years, which will generate about 5,200 jobs.
But with the company's profits and dividend coming in towards the lower end of expectations, Safeway shares reversed a recent trend to slip to a low of 362 pence, down nine, before recovering to 370 by 1150 GMT,
Safeway checked in half year pretax profits of 228.2 million pounds ($383.5 million), compared with forecasts of between 228 and 231 million. It paid a dividend of 4.4 pence, up from 4.05 pence and within forecasts of 4.4 to 4.6 pence per share.
The company, which completed its ""Safeway 2000"" strategic review in the summer aimed at boosting sales and cutting costs, said sales from existing stores were up five percent in the first five weeks of the second half.
That followed a 5.1 percent gain in the first half, including price inflation of 2.6 percent.
""Our strategy to attract more family shoppers to our stores is succeeding and this success is reflected in sales growth which is outperforming the industry average,"" the company said.
But Smith said the sector was ""very competitive...and margins at the moment are slightly down.""
Supermarkets are attempting to steer clear of an all-out price war by relying on marketing initiatives such as loyalty cards and customer service to boost sales, but pricing remains a key element.
In the first half, a fierce petrol price war hit profitability in Safeway's petrol forecourts to the tune of 10 million pounds, but Smith said he hoped this would not impact on the second half.
Gross margins have run slightly down on a year ago in the first half and start of the second half, Safeway said, driven by ""our immediate and vigorous response to a number of significant marketing and pricing initiatives launched by our competitors.""
But net margins were stable in the first half at 6.9 percent as productivity gains and efficiency improvements helped.
The supermarket chain plans to extend its innovative self-scan shopping, where customers track and total their own shopping to avoid queueing at checkouts. The scheme will be added at 50 stores on top of the current 100.
Smith said the company would continue to focus on the family shopper and the large family weekly shop to boost sales.
""Increasing efficiencies mean we can be a low cost operator...which allows us to afford to reinvest in being competitive."" ($1=.5950 Pound)

19,"British regional electricity company Northern Electric on Monday promised to rush out results by the end of November to prove that a $1.225 billion hostile bid from America's CE Electric undervalued it. But CE Electric said it still felt its 630 pence per share offer was full and fair, adding that there was ""nothing in Northern Electric's defence document which changes our view.""
In its first formal defence since CE Electric posted its bid on November 5, Northern said the half-year figures, previously scheduled for December 5, would include ""important financial information"" to show the value of the company. It reiterated its belief that the offer was too low and said that when CE Electric announced the bid at the end of October, it had suggested a price of 700 pence per share.
But CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by U.S. energy group CalEnergy, denied this in a statement on Monday, saying: ""This ambitious range was entirely the proposal of Northern Electric's board.""
The U.S. group has already snapped up nearly 30 percent of its target, as Northern's shares were clouded by uncertainty over whether the government would approve the bid. Northern shares eased half a penny to 608-1/2 pence by 1543 GMT. Northern confirmed it planned to pay a 56.5 pence special dividend in February 1997 if CE Electric's offer lapsed and said that could mean the U.S. firm stood to reap gross yields of over 9.5 percent a year from its net investment. ""Northern Electric is worth more to CE Electric,"" the company said in a statement. But CE Electric said the special dividend was ""fully reflected"" in the share price before the offer was launched. Northern chairman David Morris said the company believed that uncertainty as to whether CE Electric's bid would be referred to the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission) was dominating the market's reaction and keeping the share low. The British government has approved takeovers of seven of the original 12 cash-rich regional electricity companies (Recs) in two years, of which three were bought by U.S. companies. Only two bids for Recs have been blocked, when offers from generators National Power and PowerGen were deemed against the public interest by trade secretary Ian Lang. Northern itself is the only Rec to have survived a hostile bid, when it fended off Trafalgar House, now a unit of Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound ($934.2 million) benefit package last year.
Since Northern came under threat, East Midlands Electricity agreed to a 670 pence per share $2.15 billion takeover by Dominion Resources of the U.S. last week. Bid speculation has sparked price rises in other RECS, including Yorkshire Electricity.
A report in the Sunday Telegraph said Yorkshire was in talks with Entergy of the U.S., but both firms denied this on Monday.Shares in Yorkshire gained 12 pence to 747-1/2 pence while East Midlands slipped 2-1/2 pence to 623 pence. The market is worried that political pressures on the ruling Conservative government, which opinion polls put in second place before the general election less than six months away, might prompt it to block any more bids.
The electricity sector, privatised by the Conservatives in 1989, has proved unpopular due to high dividend payouts, hefty executive pay packets and head-turning takeover deals.

19,"Britain's nuclear generator British Energy Plc said on Tuesday it would announce job cuts and cost savings on October 9 which were largely expected by the market but criticised by opposition politicians.
""It is clear that British Energy has not performed as they promised they would,"" Labour's energy and industry spokesman John Battle said in a statement.
A British Energy spokesman confirmed Wednesday's announcement would cover job cuts and cost savings but declined to give further details.
Analysts said they were expecting the company to outline a cut of some 20 percent in its workforce of over 6,500 by the year 2000.
""That's what we have based our valuation on, it was the figure given to the analysts' briefing over privatisation,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
Newspaper reports this week have said the company could cut between 1,300-1,500 posts in an effort to make cost savings of around 100 million pounds ($156.4 million).
Battle called on British Energy to confirm the dividend policy outlined in the company's privatisation prospectus, which warned that it was vulnerable to underperformance by nuclear power stations.
At privatisation, the company said its initial interim dividend would be 4.6 pence per share and forecasts for final dividend are at 9.1 pence for 1996/97.
But Labour's Battle said the job cuts could damage performance and see the company falling below targets. ""Performance targets anticipated in the prospectus have never previously been consistently achieved and the loss of a reported 1,300...staff is expected to further undermine chances of reaching them,"" Battle said.
British Energy, which runs eight nuclear power stations in England and Scotland, was one of the ruling Conservative party's most unpopular privatisations when it was sold off in July.
It had a first instalment price of 100 pence for small investors and 105 pence for institutions but slid below these levels at its debut and has rarely moved above since.
Its launch was overshadowed by concerns over its future profitability when it closed two of its eight reactors after finding cracks just days before shares started trading. Analysts said the job cuts had largely been outlined at the time of privatisation.
""All that has been absorbed into forecasts,"" said Kevin Lapwood of Merrill Lynch.
British Energy shares were down half a penny at 105 pence by 1109 GMT, which analysts said reflected market nonchalance over job cuts. ($1=.6393 Pound)

19,"British water and sewerage company South West Water saw half year profits surge on Thursday and it hiked its dividend 20 percent, as expected, with a promise of real dividend increases of eight percent in coming years.
""The dividend policy will continue to be based on the pursuit of progressive growth,"" the company said in a statement.
South West Water's pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 rose to 72.9 million pounds ($120.4 million), up 35 percent and ahead of expectations which were between 57 and 68 million pounds.
It had promised to pay out an interim dividend of 11.8 pence when two proposed bids for it, from Severn Trent and Wessex, were blocked by the UK government in October.
In a statement, the company said it hoped to raise the total dividend for the year by 20 percent and then reach eight percent real increases in the annual payout to shareholders.
But the half year surge in profits was unlikely to be repeated, finance director Ken Hill told Reuters.
""I do not think a 35 percent increase in PBT (profit before tax) is likely to occur at the end of this year,"" he said, nor in years immediately following. ""But we are looking for profit increases,"" he added.
Shares in the company gained five pence to 582.5 pence by 0940 GMT.
Anglian Water, which reported last week, saw half year profits rise 5.5 percent and raised its dividend 14.6 percent.
Thames Water, which kicked off the flow of interim results in the sector on October 29, turned in pretax profits before exceptionals up 15 percent and raised its dividend 22 percent.
South West Water has also committed to pay out a rebate of 15 pounds each to customers after trade secretary Ian Lang blocked the bids, which were awaiting approval before being priced.
Hill said the company's strategy now was to ""focus on the core business...and develop very carefully the strategy of the non-regulated businesses.""
South West Water has interests in waste management, environmental instrumentation and construction services, which contributed 6.6 million pounds to profits in the first half.
Hill said recent tax changes affecting some share buy backs would not alter the company's strategy of only using its mandate if it were in the interests of shareholders.
South West Water said a complicated financing deal which involves standby letters of credit which are counter-indemnified by cash deposits had contributed 5.7 million pounds to first half profits.
The facility should boost annual profits by nine million pounds in each of the next three years, the company added.
It said capital expenditure was 61.6 million pounds in the first half of the year and ""a further substantial uplift is planned for the second half.""
Water leakage, an issue which has triggered severe criticism of water companies from politicians and lobby groups, has been cut to 21 percent from 28 percent in 1992, the company said.
Its target of only 15 percent of water leaking from infrastructure by 1999 should be reached, it added.
The company's non-executive chairman Keith Court steps down in February and a replacement is being sought after non-executive deputy chairman Alan Fletcher bowed out.

19,"Shares in media group Pearson rose sharply on Monday as takeover speculation swirled on a report, later denied, that broadcaster BSkyB might be planning a bid, just days after new management was appointed.
""The price was boosted last week by the management change but now it reflects revived bid speculation,"" said one sector analyst who declined to be named.
Pearson shares were up 25 pence at 721-1/2 pence by 1115 GMT after touching a peak of 745 pence, a high for the year.
A report in Monday's Independent newspaper said BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake, was in the early stages of planning a bid worth more than four billion pounds ($6.4 billion) in cooperation with a U.S.-based media group.
But BSkyB's chief executive, Sam Chisholm, was quoted in later editions of Murdoch's Times newspaper saying there were ""no talks taking place between News Corp, BSkyB or any associated company about a bid for Pearson.""
BSkyB was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times newspaper, Penguin Books and a number of television production companies, said it did not comment on speculation.
Analysts said although BSkyB appeared to have ruled itself out of a bid, observers felt any move on Pearson was likely to be made before new management takes control next year.
Last week, Pearson appointed Marjorie Scardino to be chief executive from January 1 -- the first female head of a company represented in the key FT-SE 100 share index -- and Dennis Stevenson chairman.
""If someone is thinking seriously about a bid, now is the time to do it. The new management hasn't arrived yet and so it would be harder to mount a defence,"" said one media analyst who asked not to be identified.
But analysts said Pearson shares were now approaching the top end of their price target range for full valuation of the business and the price tag attached to speculation around BSkyB was high.
""It is touching the stratosphere at these levels,"" said Anthony De Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon.
The media analyst said it was difficult to put a price tag on Pearson because its diversified nature meant it could have specific attractions for a variety of bidders.
Speculation of a bid for the company last surfaced in August when Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed-Elsevier was rumoured as a possible buyer.
After initial stock market disappointment, Scardino's appointment at Pearson was greeted with a 12 pence jump in shares on Friday as hopes emerged that she might reorganise the sprawling media company.
The Sunday Times newspaper reported that a sale of its television interests, which include soap opera and games show producer Grundy, might be on the cards.
""It may be that BSkyB want to acquire Grundy or Thames Television but whether they would want the entire group is another matter,"" said Anthony De Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon.
So far, Scardino appears to be keeping her options open, analysts said.
""There is no real evidence yet that she would consider any demergers and it is open to question whether such a move would bring shareholder benefit,"" the sector analyst said.
""We have the stock on a hold at the moment. Let's see what the new management comes up with and let's see if there is anything concrete behind this bid speculation,"" he added. ($1=.6298 Pound)

12,"Canadian mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd has been in hiding since it announced 17 days ago that it has formed a partnership with the son of Indonesian ruler Suharto, prompting a flurry of comment on its ethics. (Corrects description of Suharto.)
Despite a constant whirl of rumors and persistent questions that have sent the company's shares on a roller coaster ride, Bre-X is maintaining a dogged silence. 
The Calgary-based company that controls one of the world's biggest gold prospects in Indonesia has not talked to the financial press for weeks. Company officials will take calls only from a handful of favoured analysts, according to market sources.
""I haven't had any calls returned,"" said gold analyst Rick Cohen with Goepel Shields in Vancouver. ""There seems to be a certain number of people they talk to. Everybody's a bit in the dark."" 
Bre-X sent out a news release on October 28 about its alliance Suharto's son, Sigit Harjojudanto, whose business influence is pervasive in Indonesia.
Since then, instead of directly addressing material questions about its business in Indonesia -- many of which are playing havoc with its stock price -- Bre-X has opted instead to leak to the market carefully selected press material.
On Sunday, for example, the company faxed the media, analysts and shareholders a copy of a story from the Far Eastern Economic Review detailing its links with Sigit. 
The article referred to Sigit's possible ties with the Indonesian army, stated flatly that one of Bre-X's Indonesian partners has been bought out and asserted that Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold Corp had tried to push Bre-X into a bad deal.
Despite questions about the article, Bre-X refused to respond and still has not said whether it endorses the story or puts any faith in the statements contained in the story.
""I've certainly suggested a few times that they talk to the media and clear things up,"" said Neil Winchester, manager of surveillance at the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
""It would be advantageous to the marketplace,"" he added.
Rumors have surrounded Bre-X since the Indonesian government said last month it would not issue essential contracts of work until Bre-X cleared up an ownership dispute with some of its Indonesian partners.
The dispute has placed a cloud over Bre-X's search to find a major mining partner to help it develop the rich Busang gold deposit in East Kalimantan, but the alliance with Suharto's son was expected to help the company clear up its problems. 
""They're optimistic that they can get everything (the permits) within a couple of weeks,"" said gold analyst Michael Fowler of Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, who said he spoke with Bre-X on Tuesday.
But he said Bre-X would not comment on the article it distributed. ""They just sent it out for general interest purposes,"" he added.
Still, the rumors in the article and other rampant gossip are taking a toll on shares linked to Bre-X. Other exploration companies in Asia have complained the uncertainty has spilled over and hurt their stocks. 
Minorca Resources Inc, a Canadian junior mining company that has an interest in the Busang deposit through an alliance with Bre-X's Indonesian partner, PT Askatindo Karya Mineral, has found itself on the defensive.
Talk about Askatindo being bought out is unfounded, Minorca president Roland Horst said in an interview. ""They have no intention to sell out,"" he said.
Minorca's chairman is in Indonesia this week meeting with Askatindo officials and verified the company's intentions.
""There were discussions, but they were rebuffed,"" said Horst. 
He added that he also had a slew of unanswered questions about Bre-X's arrangements with Suharto's son.
""To be frank, the relationship between Minorca and Bre-X is relatively cool.""

12,"Gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. is negotiating with Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to gain control of Bre-X's huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, the two companies said on Tuesday.
The companies were negotiating under the ""guidance"" of the Indonesian government, which asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, Bre-X said.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X discovered Busang, one of the world's biggest gold deposits, in 1994.
Official estimates of Busang have outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, but analysts have said that number could rise to 100 million ounces.
""This is a result of Barrick working very hard behind the scenes to circumvent Bre-X's sale process,"" one analyst said of the news. Bre-X has been seeking a partnership with a major gold producer to operate Busang.
To satisfy Indonesia, Bre-X would keep 25 percent of its stake and 75 percent would go to Toronto-based Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer.
Bre-X said that the Indonesian government ""would appreciate it if the parties could consider a 10 percent participation being given to the Indonesian government.""
The Indonesian government wants Barrick and Bre-X to reach a deal by December 4 or else the government ""will take steps to prevent a delay in the development"" of Busang, Bre-X said.
Development of Busang has been held up by disputes between Bre-X and its Indonesian partners over ownership of the discovery.
Bre-X, which controls 90 percent of Busang, said it asked Indonesia's Mines Ministry if other deals would be acceptable, but had not yet received an answer.
A deal between the two companies was not a sure thing, Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in an interview.
He said he had no details about how much money or stock would change hands or when a deal would be reached.
With the Indonesian government guiding the Busang negotiations, Bre-X's powers to negotiate a favorable deal were curbed, analysts said.
""There have been some constraints imposed on Bre-X,"" said mining analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital Corp. in Montreal. ""That's going to negatively impact on how much Bre-X can receive for its interest.""
But Barrick has an international reputation at stake and will have to be seen to treat Bre-X fairly, analysts said.
""Given the possible questions that may be raised over how Barrick obtained this special status, it will be essential that they are viewed as treating Bre-X shareholders fairly in any negotiations going forward,"" said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.
Barrick shares soared on the news, gaining C$2.30 to C$38.85 by mid-afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They rose 2-1/4 to 29-3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bre-X shares fell in Toronto before the news and held steady in active trading at C$20.10, down C$2.45, after the market digested the news.
Its stock has been volatile lately, clouded by the ownership dispute over Busang.
Busang would set Barrick well on its way to achieving its dream of becoming the world's biggest gold company.
In 1995, the company -- already North America's largest -- produced 3.1 million ounces of gold and had gold reserves totaling 43.3 million ounces.
It has become increasingly aggressive in moving towards its goal, analysts said.
Last summer, Barrick acquired Arequipa Resources Ltd. and its promising Pierina gold property in Peru for about $800 million.

12,"Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd., moved on Monday to resolve a dispute over its huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, forging an alliance with a company controlled by the eldest son of Indonesia's President Suharto.
""This is an important first step to the resolution of Bre-X's problems,"" said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements Canada.
The stock jumped C$3.50 to C$24.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, topping actives on more than 6.4 million shares. On Nasdaq, Bre-X rose $2.625 to $18.25.
Bre-X said it will pay $40 million for a deal with PT Panutan Duta, part of the Panutan group run by Sigit Harjojudanto, Suharto's eldest son.
Analysts said the alliance with Panutan Duta, part of the Panutan group involved in energy, mining and telecommunications, should help Bre-X clear up a widely publicised dispute over the ownership of its glittering Busang gold discovery.
Bre-X stock has taken a beating in recent weeks because of the dispute.
One of Bre-X's Indonesian partners, Jusuf Merukh, is seeking a 40 percent stake in Busang, which has estimated gold reserves of 47 million ounces.
The Indonesian government has said it will delay issuing the crucial contracts of work to Bre-X until the dispute is resolved. Without the contracts, Bre-X cannot advance its work on the Busang deposit.
The dispute has also clouded Bre-X's quest to find a major mining partner to develop and operate Busang.
Panutan will receive a 10 percent interest in the richest parts of the Busang gold deposit on the island of Kalimantan, Bre-X said.
In return, Panutan will act as a consultant for Bre-X in Indonesia and help the Calgary, Alberta-based company deal with administrative and technical matters. The deal is conditional on Bre-X's receiving essential permits from the Indonesian government.
""Having an arrangement with this fellow is a bonus,"" said Ing, the analyst. ""The key in Indonesia is who you know.""
""They seemed to have teamed up with a partner with high standing,"" said mining analyst Michael Fowler of brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion.
""This should clear up most of the (ownership) claims that are out there.""
Merukh told Reuters in Jakarta on Monday that he was optimistic a deal would be reached in November.
But Bre-X's hold on the Busang discovery is shrinking as it works out its problems, said Ing.
He said Bre-X will probably have to give away another slice of the deposit to Merukh and his Australian supporters, Golden Valley Mines NL.
""Slowly and salami-like, Bre-X is getting cut back,"" said Ing.
Officials at Bre-X did not return phone calls to discuss details of the alliance.

12,"The world's gold producers will likely pay dearly for the steep fall in the bullion price and the deep uncertainty overhanging the gold market.
If the bullion price weakness continues or worsens, gold miners face lower profits, money-losing operations, closed mines, slashed exploration budgets and plunging share prices.
Analysts predict smaller companies will be increasingly vulnerable to takeovers as industry conditions get rougher.  
""Earnings are going to be terrible,"" said gold analyst Michael Fowler at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion in Toronto. ""There have already been some mines that have shut and there could be a few more. And consolidation is likely to continue.""
Gold, which was fixed at $358.55 an ounce in London on Friday, has lost more than $13 since the start of the new year, and few analysts believe the decline is finished.
The low price has already taken its toll on Canadian gold stocks, knocking the Toronto Stock Exchange's heavily weighted gold index down more than nine percent since Dec. 30.  
At least two companies have announced shutdowns of marginal mines recently. Toronto-based TVX Gold Inc. said earlier this week it would close its Casa Berardi gold mine in Quebec. In December, Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc. said it would sell two small mines in Quebec and stop work at its high-cost Paymaster mine in Northern Ontario.
""That can certainly happen again,"" said Jim Taylor, mining analyst with Yorkton Securities in London. ""The high-cost producers are certainly vulnerable.""  
The effect will begin to show in fourth-quarter earnings, and earnings in the first quarter of 1997 will certainly reflect the low bullion price, according to analysts.
If Merrill Lynch's predictions of an average 1997 gold price of between $370 and $375 an ounce hold true, it could spell earnings trouble for many producers.
Merrill Lynch analyst David Christensen predicted that U.S. gold firm Homestake Mining Co.'s earnings for the year would drop to about 13 cents a share if gold averaged $370. Homestake would earn 22 cents a share at a gold price of $385.  
Companies that do not hedge their gold sales -- such as Homestake, Echo Bay Mines Ltd., Battle Mountain Gold Co. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. -- were especially vulnerable, Christensen said. Other analysts mentioned Royal Oak Mines Inc. and Pegasus Gold Inc. as prime victims of a lower price.
""A surprisingly large number of these companies are marginal -- companies that you wouldn't traditionally think of being marginal producers,"" he said.  
Companies that rely on the spot price of gold ""are fully exposed to a decline in the gold price,"" Christensen noted. ""They're all either spot sellers or don't have significant forward selling. They'll all be negatively affected in terms of earnings and cash flow.""
One exception was U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp., which would likely see earnings rise in 1997 because of projects ready to start this year, he added. His projection did not take into account the potential acquisition of Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp..  
Even companies with solid hedging programs, such as Canada-based Barrick Gold Corp., will likely find their share prices hit along with the gold price.
""This is a sentiment swing,"" said gold analyst Manford Mallory with Research Capital in Toronto. Investors do not usually differentiate between hedgers and non-hedgers when the gold price starts to drop, he added.
Although some analysts believe a few more marginal projects could bite the dust if the gold price stays low, most say the production effects of lower gold prices will become apparent in decisions to delay development.  
""Most of these companies will continue to produce as long as they are cash flow positive as opposed to earnings positive,"" said Christensen.
But as earnings start to drop, one of the first casualties will likely be exploration budgets. While some 1997 exploration commitments have been made, high-cost companies could find themselves slashing any flexible plans in order to cut their losses.  
Exploration companies will become more vulnerable to takeover moves from larger companies with strong cash flow, analysts said. As the low price of gold discourages investors, junior companies will find it more difficult to raise money for exploration programs.
""The capital is drying up,"" said analyst Daniel McConvey of Lehman Brothers in New York.
The smaller companies may well see their share prices drop, making it cheaper for companies laden with cash to swallow them.  
Toronto-based Kinross Gold Corp. a mid-tier producer, said it plans to take advantage of the sector weakness to expand.
""I would classify us as a predator,"" Kinross spokesman Gord McReary said in an interview. ""We think we're in a very privileged position. We're in the kind of strange situation where maybe some of the bad news for the sector can be good news for us,"" he said.  
Gold equities in Australia may also be knocked down by lower gold prices, said analyst Taylor. But since many Australian companies hedge their sales, earnings will not be hurt as much as among some companies in North America.
In South Africa, however, analysts expect first-quarter earnings to be trampled by low gold prices.
In Mexico, mining giants Industrias Penoles and Grupo Mexico will probably not alter their expansion plans for polymetallic mines with high gold contents but will see slightly differing bottom-line impacts.
"
12,"Falling gold prices have recently drained much of the life from the Toronto Stock Exchange's key gold index and analysts say the bloodletting may not be over.
""Gold stocks are still reflecting a $380 gold price, but look at the price now,"" said gold analyst Mike Jalonen at brokerage Midland Walwyn in Toronto. ""It's awful.""
""I think people are writing the obituary for the Toronto gold index,"" said Vahid Fathi, a mining analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago. ""They've been slaughtered.""
The Comex February gold price has slid steadily since Dec. 30 to $355.70 an ounce on Wednesday from $370.90. Gold was up slightly in London on Thursday at $356.60.
Gold prices have slumped to three-year lows on a strong U.S. dollar, booming financial markets, low inflation, rising mine production and rumors of central bank selling.
Most analysts said the yellow metal was headed further south, but there was no consensus on the extent of the decline or when prices might recover.
The heavily weighted gold index in Toronto, Canada's biggest stock market, has dropped with the price of the metal, losing more than nine percent since Dec. 30.
Canada's biggest gold companies, Barrick Gold Corp. and Placer Dome Inc. have followed suit.
Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer, closed at C$35.55 on Wednesday, down from C$39.50 on Dec. 30. The stock rose slightly on Thursday to C$35.75. In New York, Barrick has fallen to 26-3/8 from 28-7/8 on Dec. 30.
Vancouver-based Placer Dome fell to a 52-week low of C$27.05 on Wednesday from C$30.90 on Dec. 30. It was up C$0.30 to C$27.35 on Thursday. In New York, Placer fell to 20-1/4 on Thursday from 22-5/8 on Dec. 30.
U.S. gold producers have also been hit. Newmont Mining Corp. was trading at 40 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, versus 45-1/4 on Dec. 30. Homestake Mining Co. was at 13 5/8 on Thursday in New York, down from 14-1/4 on Dec. 30.
Traditionally, Toronto gold stocks move up in tandem with the gold price, but do not react as strongly to a price decline.
Discoveries, takeover rumors and news from exploration companies that share the Toronto gold index with major producers generally temper the index's reaction to price slumps.
That is not the case now.
""At this point in time, the market is not even paying attention to special situations,"" said Fathi.
On Wednesday, almost every stock in the Toronto gold index fell except for diamond companies.
Midland Walwyn's Jalonen predicted Toronto golds would lose a further five percent before they stabilized.
Diversified producers such as Vancouver-based Teck Corp. were not as vulnerable as pure gold producers to steep drops in the gold price, Jalonen noted.
"
12,"North America's major gold companies are waging an expensive battle to win the coveted title of world's biggest gold producer.
""We want more of the action,"" said Hugh Leggatt, spokesman for Vancouver-based gold firm Placer Dome Inc.. ""We want to be positioned in the industry as a bigger player.""
Placer Dome has made a $600 million bid for Highlands Gold Ltd. of Papua New Guinea and the 25 percent of Placer Pacific Ltd.  it does not already own.
The company also plans to raise $300 million through a preferred share issue and sell off some small Canadian mine properties.
Placer also has its eye on Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta-based exploration company that discovered what could become one of the world's largest gold mines, the Busang deposit in Indonesia.
But Bre-X is also crucial to Barrick Gold Corp.'s plan to become the world's biggest gold company.
Toronto-based Barrick is already the the world's most profitable gold company and North America's biggest, but it wants to surpass Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. to be the world's largest.
Barrick, through skilful navigation of Indonesian politics, appears to have Bre-X within its grasp. Jakarta has asked the two companies to form a joint venture to develop the 57 million ounce Busang deposit, with Barrick controlling 75 percent.
Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp. was interested in Bre-X, but when Barrick appeared to gain the upper hand, Newmont turned its sights to Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp., a mid-tier gold company.
Although Newmont seems to have lost out on its stock swap offer for Santa Fe to a $2.3 billion competing bid from Homestake Mining Co., analysts said Newmont was still hunting for other takeover targets.
""This is a very capital-intensive industry and it's becoming a global industry,"" Newmont spokesman Doug Hock said in an interview.
""In order to compete, you have to have large resources to do that. What you see is the larger players becoming bigger in order to compete.""
Homestake is poised to become North America's second-biggest gold company after Barrick if its takeover of Santa Fe succeeds.
Major gold companies are under pressure from their shareholders to keep gold reserves growing, analysts said.
""If one company gets big, they have a lot of clout in the marketplace to acquire properties or resources,"" said gold analyst Michael Fowler of brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion.
With gold bullion prices in a steep decline, the share prices of many mid-tier companies have been hit, making takeovers cheaper, Fowler said.
But he said the current leaders of the gold world, the South Africans, were not caught up in the recent consolidation.
""It looks as though they're losing out to the North Americans,"" said Fowler. ""They're behind the eight-ball really.""
North American gold producers were geared to react aggressively and quickly, but the South African producers concentrated more on paying dividends, he said. ""They don't move very fast.""
Analysts said this round of deal-making was far from over as major gold companies fought it out to satisfy their shareholders' thirst for growth.
Analysts said possible future takeover targets included large mid-tier producers such as Dayton Mining Corp., Battle Mountain Gold Co., Cambior Inc. and Echo Bay Mines Ltd..

12,"The world potash market is churning, and Canada's huge Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc is in the middle of the upheaval.
Since Potash Corp, the world's biggest potash producer, said last week it had entered into talks to buy a controlling stake in a major European potash firm, its stock has zigzagged as the market comes to terms with a quickly changing picture of the potash world.  
""You're getting into an interesting part of the fertilizer world, and I don't know what will happen,"" said James Searls, a potash analyst for the U.S. Geological Survey in Virginia.
""It's going to be really curious.""
Potash Corp wants to acquire a 51 percent interest in Kali und Salz AG from German chemical conglomerate BASF AG. If it succeeds, Potash Corp would control 25 percent of Germany's four-million-tonne-per-year potash market.
The deal would boost the Saskatchewan company's share of world production capacity to about 50 percent from 35 percent, analysts have said.  
But there is another player waiting in the wings, promising to make Potash Corp's consolidation plans more intriguing.
Asia Pacific Resources Ltd of Vancouver has made an important potash discovery in Thailand. The company says exploration so far has shown at least one mine is economical.
""We believe we've got the potential for than one,"" Asia Pacific president Gerry Wright said in an interview. ""It may be two, it may be three or whatever.""  
Wright believes the property will be producing about two million tonnes of potash by the turn of the century and between four and six million tonnes by 2005 -- a sizable chunk of the world's current production of about 40 million tonnes last year.
While Asia Pacific plans to take develop the mines itself, it has signed confidentiality agreements with eight companies in the hopes of finding a partner, said Wright.
Potash Corp is not among them, he said.  
He hopes three of the eight will sign non-binding agreements with Asia Pacific by October and one will emerge as a partner by the first quarter of 1997.
The attraction of Asia Pacific's find is its location, said analyst Sam Kanes with ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto.
""These mines appear to have twice the margin per tonne that Saskatchewan Potash gets, because it's so close to the market that imports all of it,"" Kanes said.
China and the Pacific Rim are growing potash consumers, he said, and the Thai deposits are convenient.  
But Wright has no plans to take on Potash Corp for its market share.
""We have no interest in getting into a tussel with existing suppliers to that region,"" he said.
The growing market will be big enough for everyone, he said.
But market growth depends on healthy economic growth in Asia, said Michel Prud'homme, senior minerals analyst for federal department Natural Resources Canada.
In 1995, the type of potash produced by Potash Corp had a surplus supply capacity of about 7.5 million tonnes, he said.  
""Any new major project would be jeopardizing current supply arrangements.""
The recent developments have the stock market in a tizzy. Potash Corp shares soared on news of its negotiations in Germany, but it has been a volatile ride for the stock since then.
The stock dropped off Wednesday after a U.S. brokerage downgraded it from a buy to an outperform. But it was up C$2.50 to C$104 on Thursday, due to hedge buying by fertilizer distributors trying to sidestep an expected potash price increase, analysts said.  
""It will remain volatile until this deal with Germany is settled and until APQ is settled,"" said Kanes.
Asia Pacific lost C$0.10, falling to C$10.15, but the stock has been climbing steadily on news from Thailand.

12,"Canada's Barrick Gold Corp seems poised to supplant two South African mining giants to become the world's biggest gold producer through an unprecedented deal which will give it a majority share in Indonesia's rich Busang gold discovery.
Barrick, whose high-profile board of directors includes a former U.S. President George Bush, on Wednesday confirmed weeks of rumors it was negotiating with Bre-X Minerals Ltd for a stake in the Busang deposit, which contains at least 47 million ounces of gold, possibly more.
The unusual negotiations were requested by the Indonesian government, which has urged Bre-X to hand over 75 percent of its Busang stake to Barrick and form a joint venture.
""If this thing comes off, it makes Barrick the leading gold producer in the world,"" said Fred Ketchen, vice-president of Toronto brokerage ScotiaMcLeod.
""It indicates the advantages to major companies in having such high profile people on their board as George Bush and (former Canadian prime minister) Brian Mulroney.""
Exploration at the Busang property is still in its early days, but already the potential promises to catapault Barrick's production above that of the world's two leading gold companies, Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd and Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.
Barrick started with basically no gold production in 1983 and grew through acquisition and exploration to produce about 3.1 million ounces a year.
Barrick's flamboyant chairman Peter Munk, a fabulously wealthy risk taker well connected in both business and politics, has made no secret of his ambition to make his company number one.
While neither Barrick nor Bre-X would comment on how Barrick managed to persuade the Indonesian government to virtually mandate a deal with Bre-X, pieces of an intriguing jigsaw are beginning to fit together.
Bre-X bought the Busang properties in 1993 and made the huge gold find in 1995. The discovery propelled the company's stock from pennies to over C$200 before a stock split.
After Bre-X announced it would search for a heavyweight mining partner in Busang, the Cinderella story turned sour.
One of Bre-X's Indonesian partners claimed rights to up to 40 percent of the deposit and threatened to sue. The Indonesian government then delayed granting Bre-X its vital mining permits because of the ensuing disputes. ""It's quite clear that Bre-X did not follow protocol in its ownership issues,"" said an analyst who asked not to be named.
So Bre-X set up a strategic alliance with the eldest son of Indonesia's President Suharto, hoping the alliance would help sort out its problems. At the same time, Barrick was worked behind the scenes to gain the upper hand, sources said.
""Peter Munk is a pretty smart guy,"" said Ketchen. ""No grass grows under his feet.""
Barrick developed a relationship with Suharto's eldest daughter, hiring her construction company for future mining work. It developed ties with the Indonesian government, probably using Bush and Mulroney's influence, sources said.
""They (Barrick) really did the end run. There was lots of arm twisting,"" said an executive at a rival mining company.
Spokesmen for both Bush and Mulroney declined comment.
With the Indonesian government almost forcing Bre-X into Barrick's arms, Bre-X has lost much of its bargaining power. ""The government is God here. It holds most of the cards,"" said Michael Fowler with brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffiron.
Jakarta has given the companies until December 4 to come up with an arrangement. If they do not, the Indonesian government could take matters into its own hands.
But on Wednesday Bre-X investors seemed confident that Bre-X would win a reasonable deal. They pushed the stock up C$0.65 to 21.00 in heavy trading. Barrick rose 0.75 to 39.65.
""At the end of the day, I believe Barrick will be fair,"" said Fowler. Barrick has an international reputation to uphold and could face lawsuits from Bre-X shareholders if it tries to undermine Bre-X. Barrick may buy part of Busang and act as operator, rather than bidding for Bre-X, analysts said.
""None of the parties involved here will walk away completely unscathed,"" said analyst David Christensen with Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
With all the intrigue and rumor clouding the Busang developments, investors will always wonder if they've heard the whole story, he said.

12,"Canadian nickel giant Falconbridge Ltd has a growing appetite for expansion and is poised for growth through acquisition and exploration, the company's new chief executive officer said in an interview.
""The appetite of this company is much higher than what it used to be,"" Oyvind Hushovd told Reuters on Wednesday. ""Falconbridge is in very good shape financially today, which means that we have the ability to grow.""
Hushovd, 46, replaced Frank Pickard as chief executive this month after Pickard died suddenly at the age of 63 during a business trip in Chile this September.
Hushovd, originally from Norway, has worked for Falconbridge for more than 22 years.
He spent the past year and a half working closely with Pickard in the position of executive vice-president and was chairman of the steering committee that put together a strategic plan to carry Falconbridge into the next century.
""I don't see a need to revolutionize Falconbridge,"" he said. ""The backbone of Falconbridge is nickel, and copper is another leg of Falconbridge. It will probably be like that in the future.""
However, Hushovd is not content simply to sit back and let the long-term strategic plan unfold.
The plan calls for Falconbridge to double its annual nickel production to 200,000 tonnes and triple its copper production to about 500,000 tonnes a year, within 15 years.
To do that, Falconbridge needs to find growth opportunities, especially since the company lost a bid to take over the huge Voisey's Bay nickel, copper and cobalt deposit in remote Labrador, said Hushovd.
Ongoing work in New Caledonia, Ivory Coast and Zambia should complement plans to start producing nickel by the end of next year at the Raglan project in Quebec and plans to produce copper by 1998 at the Collahuasi joint venture project in Chile, Hushovd said.
In Zambia, Falconbridge joined a consortium in November to develop the Konkola Deep copper mine, in which Falconbridge is partners with South Africa's Gencor Ltd and Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.
In New Caledonia in the South Pacific, Falconbridge is poised to gain access to nickel reserves to supply a nickel plant planned in the north of the country. The board of France's Eramet on Thursday said it had agreed to reallocate its mining reserves in New Caledonia, which would give Falconbridge access to Eramet's Koniambo field.
Hushovd does not intend not stop there.
""Falconbridge has always been very strong in exploration,"" he said. ""We felt we lacked the business development infrastructure.""
So last summer, the company set up a business development group, to search out growth opportunities either through exploration or acquisition.
While Hushovd would not hint at specific acquisition targets, he stressed, ""I want properties that are not only profitable today but are also profitable in the future.""
In any future acquisitions, Falconbridge can probably count on support from its powerful majority shareholder, Noranda Inc, which owns 46 percent.
""We have a big owner, which means that hopefully we can pursue things that might be tough to pursue on our own,"" Hushovd said. ""We can have a bigger appetite than the company on its own would have.""
Hushovd said he had no immediate plans to boost the company's share price, which peaked at C$32.75 in May but is currently trading around C$29.15.
He noted that the stock normally reflects the nickel price, which has failed to meet expectations in 1996.
""I think we all had very high hopes for nickel this year, and the market did not turn out the way that we had forecasted,"" he said.
As for next year, ""I feel it's difficult to give a prediction at the present time. Fundamentally I do believe we're going to see better prices in 97 than we did in 96,"" Hushovd said. ((Reuters Toronto Bureau 416 941-8100))

20,"Latin America's oldest and largest guerrilla army on Wednesday hailed a Peruvian rebel group's storming of the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima as a ""spectacular and well-planned"" attack.
Marco Leon Calarca, the international spokesman, based in Mexico City, of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), defended the actions of Peru's Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), which launched the raid on Tuesday night.
He said armed struggle was often the only way to break the bonds of poverty imposed by an oligarchic system.
The Colombian authorities say the formerly pro-Soviet FARC numbers about 12,000 fighters. Independent political analysts say it has more than 18,000. The Cuban-inspired MRTA is thought to have no more than about 2,000 insurgents.
""The MRTA attack was spectacular and well-planned, which suggests it does have popular support. The MRTA, like all peoples of the world, has every right to fight by all means for basic rights,"" Calarca told Reuters in a phone interview from Mexico.
""People cannot be driven into extreme poverty without putting up a fight. They must defend themselves from the aggression of neoliberalism. The oligarchy is not simply going to hand over those rights,"" he added.
Members of the MRTA travelled to Colombia in the mid-1980s to fight in the so-called America Battalion, which also consisted of Colombia's leftist M-19 rebel group and Ecuador's Alfaro Vive Carajo! The battalion launched a failed attempt to create rebel liberated zones in Colombia, starting with the southwestern city of Cali. The FARC never joined the battalion because of military and political differences.
The FARC was set up in 1964 by Communists who had fought with self-defence forces set up by the Liberal Party during 10 years of virtual civil war that started in 1948. The government now accuses it of living off a vast fortune gleaned from kidnapping, extortion and drug trafficking.
It launched one of its bloodiest offensives in August, when it killed 27 soldiers and captured 60 in an attack on a jungle base in southern Colombia. It still has not released those captives.
"
20,"British Petroleum Co Plc gave a lukewarm reception Tuesday to a Colombian proposal that would see it losing almost half the oil-rich Piedemonte field in return for sweeter contract terms on much of the remainder.
The proposal, outlined by Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar to reporters Monday, is the latest twist in a long- running saga that has seen BP trying to boost the profit margins on its Piedemonte operations while Colombia seeks to sidestep criticism that it is allowing multinationals to call the shots.  
Piedemonte, in Colombia's eastern plains is estimated to contain between 600 million and one billion barrels of crude oil and condensates.
But so far BP has only pinpointed three hydrocarbon formations -- Volcanera, Pauto and Florena -- accounting for about 15 percent of the total area, arguing that current overheads do not make it profitable to explore the rest.  
If Villamizar's complex proposal were accepted, a BP spokesman said it would require the company to hand back rights to the 85 percent of the Piedemonte field that is still virtually unexplored, with the guarantee that state oil company Ecopetrol would re-award BP half that area under improved contract terms.
The spokesman for BP's Colombian subsidiary, BP Exploration Co (Colombia) Ltd, told Reuters: ""This is an interesting proposal but we regret that this solution would mean losing access to what is a large proportion of the Piedemonte field.""  
He conceded it may be a possible way forward but indicated that it represented little more than an opening gambit in the search for a new working formula between BP, Colombia's single largest foreign investor, and Ecopetrol.
Under the so-called ""sliding scale"" terms of the existing Piedemonte association contract, profits are divided equally between BP and Ecopetrol while production remains below 60 million barrels. Ecopetrol's share rises as production increases, topping out at 76 percent when output hits 150 million barrels.  
BP had been pressing for the entire Piedemonte contract to be renegotiated using the new-style Factor R, which takes account of investment and operating costs in individual fields to ensure adequate profit margins for foreign companies.
But those demands were rejected by Villamizar last month following a congressional debate. Villamizar's new proposal, however, would open the way for a Factor R contract to be drawn up on that area of the Piedemonte field which BP would cede and then win back. Ecopetrol would then operate the rest of field itself or contract it to other private oil companies.  
Gustavo Triana, a senior official of the powerful USO oil workers' union, known for its fierce opposition to multinationals, said the union would not readily welcome any ""underhand deal"" that granted better terms to BP after the government had said it would not do so.
"
20,"Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria on Thursday criticised the United States for its policy of rewarding or punishing countries based on their measures to fight drug trafficking.
During a visit to Colombia, Gurria said the so-called certification process was a barrier to cooperation in the war on drugs and renewed calls for scrapping the system, saying decisions were often based on ulterior motives.
""The process of certification inhibits cooperation and puts the country under scrutiny in a very difficult position. I believe there are much better ways of promoting cooperation,"" Gurria said at a news conference. He added that ""the decision is often based on criteria other than those that one would rationally take into consideration.""
Last year, Colombia was struck off the United States' list of allies in the drug war. Mexico came under severe criticism but managed to get certification and escape sanctions.
Mexico has since set up a ministerial contact group to address the issue with Washington, and that has led to an improved climate between the two governments, Gurria said.
Colombia has continued to come under heavy criticism from the United States for its perceived failure to crack down hard enough on drug trafficking.
Politicians and political analysts were divided on whether Colombia would regain certification this March in the wake of of a new law to strip drug kingpins of narcotics profits.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 80 percent of the world's cocaine is supplied by Colombia while more than half that on the streets of U.S. cities has been transported through Mexico.

20,"British Petroleum Co Plc considers its Piedemonte prospect in eastern Colombia ""fundamental"" to its worldwide operations despite drilling problems and wrangles over the exploitation contract, a top company official said Thursday.
John Doust, executive director of BP's local subsidiary, British Petroleum Exploration (Colombia) Ltd, predicted the field, still at the test stage, could come on stream by the end of 1999.
He estimated the total cost of developing the field, estimated to contain between 600 million and one billion barrels of crude and condensates, could run to about $2.2 billion, some of which would be shared by state oil company Ecopetrol.
""The oil project currently under way in the Piedemonte is fundamental for the worldwide organisation of the BP group,"" Doust said in a speech to journalists.
His recognition of the strategic importance of the 287,000 hectare block, in which BP has pinpointed three promising hydrocarbon formations after exploring just 15 percent of the total area, once again raises the question how BP will push the Colombian government for sweeter contract terms.
BP, Colombia's single largest foreign investor, argues that given tough drilling conditions, the terms of its so-called sliding scale association contract with Ecopetrol makes it unprofitable to exploit the field.
Under the existing contract, Ecopetrol's share of the profits rise as production increases from 50 percent to a maximum 76 percent.
BP has been pushing for a so-called R Factor contract -- which the Colombian government has so far denied -- which would take account of investment and operating costs to ensure adequate profit margins.
""We understand the uncertainty of the (Piedemonte) issue and the nature of the debate have caused uneasiness amongst many people... Let us keep in mind that we are truly seeking to achieve a break-even point and a platform of confidence for BP so that we can operate in an internationally competitive economic position,"" Doust said.
Last month, Colombia's Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar proposed BP should hand back rights to the 85 percent of the block that is virtually unexplored with the guarantee that Ecopetrol would re-award BP half that area under R Factor conditions at a later date and contract out the remainder to other companies.
Doust said BP was ""seriously considering"" the proposal. It is understood, however, that BP would be loath to surrender the rights to almost 50 percent of a block with huge potential under the current offer on the table.
BP has recently been hit by allegations of indirect links to right-wing paramilitary death squads that have assassinated social leaders close to its operations in eastern Colombia.
Doust blamed the accusations on a campaign to discredit the company and repeated earlier statements that he had invited the country's chief prosecutor to carry out an in-depth investigation into the claims.

20,"Colombia's main oil union postponed a decision to launch an indefinite strike in protest against the arrest of 11 members on terrorism charges after top-level talks with the government Sunday night, leaders said.
The 5,700-strong USO union, known for its fiercely nationalistic stance, had been due to set a start date for a crippling stoppage at a general assembly Monday. Industrial action would have begun ""soon after"" Monday's meeting, union head Hernando Hern ndez said last week.

20,"A U.S. pilot flying his first anti-drug mission in Colombia was killed when his plane crashed in a jungle area of southeast Colombia on Tuesday, police said.
The pilot was identified by police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano as Robert Martin, 35. He was flying a U.S.-registered Turbo Thrush T-65 crop-dusting plane and had been fumigating illicit plantations of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. His hometown was not released.
U.S. ambassador Myles Frechette confirmed the aviator's death and said he was the first U.S. pilot, sent to the country under the terms of a U.S. State Department contract with the Colombian government, to die on such a mission.
He said Martin's body had been recovered and said the cause of the accident would be fully investigated.
""The most likely cause of the crash was human error or mechanical failure. Leftist guerrillas are present in the zone but this plantation was very remote and I doubt the rebels could have shot down the plane,"" Serrano said.
Police said it was the first day of the pilot's contract.
The crash occurred in a remote area of Guaviare province, one of Colombia's main coca producing regions. Martin was flying one of four planes on the spraying mission and was one of six U.S. pilots assisting Colombia's drug crop eradication programme.
Illicit plantations are often guarded by heavily armed gangs and sometimes by leftist guerrillas, which the government accuses of being involved in drug trafficking. It was not clear whether the plane had come under fire.
""Unfortunately narco-terrorists frequently fire at these (crop-dusting) planes. They don't know whether Colombians or Americans are flying them,"" Col. Luis Carlos Ortiz, second-in- command of the Colombian anti-narcotics police, told Reuters.
The U.S. pilots were originally only permitted to train Colombian pilots. But since October the Colombian authorities gave them the green light to fly live missions to eradicate coca leaf and opium poppy plantations.
All the pilots are civilians, employed by Texas-based aviation company Dyncorp, but a State Department spokesman told Reuters that some were former U.S. servicemen. Dyncorp declined to comment on the accident.
Last year Colombia's U.S.-backed drug crop eradication programme destroyed about 14,000 acres (6,500 hectares) of poppy and more than 44,500 acres (18,000 hectares) of coca leaf.
"
20,"Colombia has taken the first step to lifting a constitutional ban on extradition but the country's crusading anti-drug prosecutor on Wednesday dismissed the move as virtually meaningless.
Amid threats of a repeat of the bloodbath unleashed by drug gangs against extradition in the late 1980s, a Senate panel approved draft legislation late on Tuesday to lift the prohibition on sending Colombians abroad to stand trial
But chief prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso said the measure prohibited as much as it allowed and threatened to hog-tie the government in endless red tape. He said the legislation should be strengthened before a final vote in Congress.
""What we should be doing here is lifting the 1991 ban, which was a national disgrace. But the text approved by the Senate doesn't represent any advance,"" he said. ""I'm not saying it's a step back but it leaves us in exactly the same position.""
The draft legislation approved by an 11-8 vote by the Senate constitutional committee was also unlikely to satisfy Colombia's critics in the United States.
If the draft survives a required seven more congressional votes, it would open the door to extradition in some isolated cases. But it would not be retroactive, ensuring that the Cali cartel drug lords jailed last year, the target of a U.S. extradition request in June, will never see U.S. courts.
Furthermore, the legislation would prevent the extradition of criminals who voluntarily surrendered to Colombian justice and forbid their handover if they risked receiving stiffer sentences abroad than those they would face at home.
One of the main arguments by U.S. authorities, who have long pressed for the extradition of drug traffickers, is that Colombian justice is too lenient and convicted drug lords continue running their criminal empires from behind bars.
Drug lords led by Pablo Escobar, the late and notoriously violent leader of the Medellin cartel, waged a nationwide campaign of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations in the late 1980s and early 1990s to force the government to impose the constitutional ban on extradition passed by Congress in 1991. Memories of the thousands of people who died in that campaign of terror are still fresh.
Death threats against extradition supporters have been scrawled in the last week on walls around Cali, home to the powerful syndicate that edged out Escobar's organisation to become the world's major cocaine supplier.
A group calling itself ""Colombians For Peace"" issued pamphlets reminding people of the bloodbath of the 1980s because of the extradition issue.  ""Today that situation is once again threatening Colombia. Avoiding it depends on the government, congress and our judges,"" it said.
President Ernesto Samper, dogged by allegations of his own ties to drug lords, has said the extradition debate was poorly timed and insisted that priority should be given to his own proposal to introduce stiffer penalties for drug crimes.
"
20,"A former Colombian rebel leader who masterminded a 61-day takeover of an embassy in Bogota in 1980 on Wednesday urged Peruvian guerrillas holding hostages in the Japanese embassy residence in Lima to keep cool.
Rosemberg Pavon, alias ""Comandante Uno"" of the now defunct M-19 group, urged the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) gunmen to avoid bloodshed.
He said the crisis in Lima, where MRTA guerrillas took up to 490 hostages in the residence on Tuesday evening, hung by a thread and one false move by the rebels or security forces could spark a bloodbath.
Pavon headed an occupation of the Dominican embassy in Bogota which began in February 1980. A 15-strong commando of the M-19 held 57 hostages, including 19 diplomats, for 61 days before mediation by Cuban leader Fidel Castro ended the crisis and the guerrillas took refuge in Cuba.
""These situations are moments of high tension, great uncertainty and intense panic. The MRTA must try to keep as calm as possible,"" Pavon told Reuters in a telephone interview from the southwestern city of Cali.
""At any second there could be a tragedy because the whole rebel operation hangs by a thread between success and failure,"" he said. ""Both sides must work towards a rapid solution and keep a cold head in any negotiations.""
Pavon said that the MRTA, like the M-19 which laid down its arms in 1990, was fighting for social justice.
""We shouldn't fall into the trap of generalizing the MRTA as a pro-Cuban force. Like us it is fighting for a Latin American process of democracy,"" Pavon said.
He said he would be ready to travel to Peru to help negotiate an end to the crisis based on his experiences of 1980.
""I would say to the Peruvians that these situations can only be resolved with patience and with the desire for dialogue,"" he said in a separate interview with Colombia's Caracol radio.
In 1985, M-19 guerrillas seized the Palace of Justice in Bogota and held more than 200 hostages for two days before the army stormed the building. About 100 people were killed, including rebels and judges.
""The Peruvian government must at all costs avoid any repeat of a Palace of Justice scenario. The Colombian people have still not recovered from the scars of that incident,"" he said.
"
20,"Colombian lawmakers met on Thursday in an 11th hour bid to rescue a bill that would strip drug barons of their fortunes and help avoid U.S. economic sanctions.
An 11-member conference committee was debating whether to override the lower house of Congress and empower the government to seize drug-related assets accumulated over the last 20 years.
In a narrow 59-57 vote late Tuesday, the House of Representatives rejected the 20-year time limit, previously approved by the Senate, ruling instead that criminal assets could only be seized if they had been amassed after 1991.
The conference committee meeting was convened under intense pressure from President Ernesto Samper and senior ministers. They condemned the lower house's decision as a ""virtual amnesty"" and raised fears that the United States would impose economic sanctions on Colombia in retaliation for its failure to crack down on billionaire drug lords.
The committee is widely expected to toe the government line and send the bill back to a plenary session of Congress, recommending that the 20-year time limit be reincorporated.
Colombia's business community has taken an unusually outspoken approach and been vociferous in calls to Congress to approve an asset forfeiture law with a 20-year clause.
The United States decertified Colombia as an ally in the drug war last March. Four months later, it withdrew Samper's U.S. entry visa, citing allegations that he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug cartel cash. Foreign Relations Minister Maria Emma Mejia said earlier this week there is a very real prospect of U.S. economic sanctions starting next year.
Other anti-drug legislation that the United States has demanded, such as stiffer sentencing and the reintroduction extradition, has been watered down or sunk in Congress in recent weeks.
"
20,"Colombian lawmakers bowed to intense government pressure on Thursday and put the bite back into a bill to strip drug barons of their ill-gotten gains.
If the legislation survives a congressional plenary vote -- likely to be plain sailing after a stormy passage -- it could go some way to appeasing the United States, which has threatened to slap economic sanctions on Colombia for its perceived failure to crack down on billionaire drug barons.
A conference committee hauled the asset forfeiture bill back from the brink by reversing a decision by the lower house which would have taken the teeth out of the law.
In a narrow vote on Tuesday, the House of Representatives rejected the provision, previously approved in the Senate, that would empower the government to seize drug-related assets accumulated over the last 20 years.  The House ruled the law could only be retroactive to 1991, leaving much of the property amassed by the jailed Cali Cartel kingpins, estimated at more than $50 billion, untouched.
Justice Minister Carlos Medellin, who like a handful of other top ministers spent much of the day lobbying key lawmakers in the halls of Congress, was buoyed by the committee's decision.
""Now we just have to see if the plenary session of the Senate and Chamber of Representatives approves the decision. But I don't think there will be any problem,"" he said.
Colombia's business community also heaved a sigh of relief. It had campaigned for Congress to approve the 20-year time limit in a series of pleas over the last two days. Key export sectors of the economy are likely to be hardest hit if U.S. sanctions are imposed.
Even though the asset forfeiture law now seems to have reached high ground, the road back into the good books of the United States still promises to be rocky.
Political analysts agree there is little chance of Colombia regaining certification as a U.S. ally in the drug war, which it lost last March, even if it escapes threatened sanctions.
Other anti-drug legislation which the United States has demanded, such as stiffer sentencing and the reintroduction extradition, have been watered down or sunk in Congress in recent weeks.
"
7,"Boosting the pressure on General Motors Corp. for a new labour agreement, the United Auto Workers union Friday set a Sunday night deadline for a strike against the world's largest automaker.
UAW President Stephen Yokich said in a statment that union negotiators were not optimistic that a new contract deal could be reached by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0459 GMT Monday).
While he did not say if the union's 215,000 GM hourly workers would actually strike, Yokich said the UAW had notified GM that it will terminate its extended 1993 contract with the automaker if the deadline passes with no agreement. The union typically does not work without a contract.
""UAW members have been advised to continue to work unless notified by their local union,"" Yokich said.
""The UAW bargaining team will continue to make serious efforts to achieve a new agreement. While we are not optimistic, we remain hopeful that this can be accomplished prior to the expiration of the current contract at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday,"" he added.
The move comes just three days after GM settled a contentious, 20-day strike with the Canadian Auto Workers union that caused parts shortages that are still forcing the auto giant to shut down some U.S. assembly plants.
Although the UAW talks had been moving quickly before the strike in Canada, people close to the negotiations said the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand for employment guarantees and GM's desire for flexibility to shift more parts work to outside, usually non-union suppliers.
Both Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current work forces over the next three years. GM has resisted the pattern, saying it wants to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees.
A GM spokesman said full-scale UAW negotiations at GM's Detroit headquarters will continue throughout the weekend for the first time since the strike in Canada began on Oct. 2.
In a statement, GM chief negotiator Gerald Knechtel said, ""We remain committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness.""
""We've had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since the talks began and we're hopeful we can focus with the UAW on concluding these negotiations as soon as possible.""
Meanwhile, GM continued to run out of Canadian-made parts at U.S. assembly plants. In Flint, Mich., local UAW officials said GM told more than 6,600 workers not to report to work at the automaker's massive Buick City complex on Monday.
The facility makes Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville sedans, as well as V-6 engines and other components.
Buick City is the largest of several facilities to cut back production due to shortages of parts following the end of the Canadian Auto Workers' strike this week.
On Thursday, GM laid off about 5,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in a shutdown that will last two weeks. The plant builds the popular Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars.
Also on Friday, GM notified some of the 2,926 workers at the nearby Lordstown metal stamping plant they would be idled next week. Another 474 workers at a components plant in Vandalia, Ohio, will be idled next week, GM said.
Excluding the layoffs that will start next week, GM said it had a total of 23,340 workers idled in the United States and Mexico on Friday.
GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after they ratified a new contract that puts some limits GM's ability to shift work to outside suppliers but allows the automaker to sell two contested parts plants.
"
7,"Chrysler Corp., planning for a future without fear of financial crisis, said Tuesday it can boost its annual production capacity past 4 million vehicles and grab 20 percent of the U.S. car and truck market.
Chrysler's top executives, in a series of briefings Tuesday, said the automaker was poised to boost its financial performance further through cost cuts, engineering innovations, new products and other initiatives.
Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said the automaker has not made market share a goal, but said an 18 percent to 20 percent share of the U.S. car and truck market ""is not unrealistic"" for Chrysler.
Detroit's third-largest automaker held 16.2 percent of the market during the first nine months of 1996 -- roughly its highest share ever.
After working to rebuild Chrysler's product line, operations and balance sheet after financial crises in 1980 and 1991, the automaker's management team is now focusing on long-term growth.
""For the first time in its history, this company doesn't have to spend every waking moment looking over its shoulder and worrying about its future,"" said Chrysler President Bob Lutz. ""We've moved beyond saying 'never again' to 'Why not?'""
Indeed, Eaton said he now believes that Chrysler can withstand a 10 percent to 20 percent drop in production and remain profitable -- something that was impossible five years ago.
With a string of hit products, especially Jeeps and minivans, under its belt, the automaker is planning to boost capacity to 3.765 million vehicles by the year 2000 from 3.2 million this year.
Included in those figures are a new Dodge sport utility vehicle that will go on sale in the fall of 1997. Industry analysts have said the vehicle will be called the Dodge Durango and will be based on the new Dakota compact pickup truck.
The automaker could build up to 4.2 million vehicles annually in its current assembly plants if it adds third production shifts, said manufacturing Executive Vice President Dennis Pawley.
That does not include the possible replacement of Chrysler's Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant.
Eaton confirmed that the automaker was working with state and local officials to study replacement options for the 86-year-old facility, but has made no firm plans.
Much of Chrysler's increased capacity will be aimed at overseas markets. The executive vice president of international operations, Thomas Gale, said Chrysler expected to double its international vehicle sales to 500,000 vehicles over the next three years from 250,000 this year.
Gale said he believed Chrysler can ultimately sell more than 1 million vehicles overseas but did not offer a timetable.
He showed off a prototype of a proposed ultra-low-cost car for emerging markets such as China, which features an all-plastic body and a two-cylinder, 0.8-litre engine made by Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp.
The bare-bones car, which would not meet U.S. emissions and safety regulations, resembles France's discontinued but much-loved Citroen 2CV and could sell for $5,000 to $6,000.
Eaton, who Monday announced surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings of $680 million, up from $365 million a year ago, outlined several financial goals for the automaker, without giving a timetable. They include:
-- Boosting production by 6 percent a year.
-- Cutting research and development spending to 2.5 percent of revenues from 2.7 percent. Ford Motor Co.'s spending rate is 5.9 percent of revenues, General Motors Corp. is at 5.5 percent and Toyota Motor Corp. is at 5.0 percent, Chrysler said.
-- Cutting marketing costs to 6.3 percent of sales from 6.5 percent currently.
-- Boosting return on sales to 8.0 percent from 6.5 percent for the first nine months of 1996 and 3.7 percent for the same period of 1995.
"
7,"The United Auto Workers union unleashed two local strikes against General Motors Corp.'s truck operations Tuesday night in a bid to increase pressure for new national and local labor agreements.
About 2,750 members of UAW Local 23 walked off the job at GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant at about 6 p.m. EST, followed an hour later by 4,800 workers who struck the automaker's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant.
The strikes threaten to paralyze much of GM's light truck production, the automaker's biggest source of profits.
The Janesville plant builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. The Indianapolis plant supplies doors, fenders, hoods and other sheet-metal stampings to nine North American truck assembly plants.
GM spokesman Jerry Holmes said the automaker had no formal response to the walkouts, but said negotiations were continuing Tuesday night.
UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after intense negotiations over the weekend failed to produce an agreement. He also chided GM for a lack of progress in local negotiations at individual plants.
The expiration of the GM's national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers on Sunday meant that UAW locals were free to resort to strikes to get local issues resolved, Yokich said.
""I'm the one who called this strike,"" UAW regional director Ron Gettelfinger said of the Indianapolis strike. He added that the walkout was aimed solely at resolving local issues, which he refused to identify.
All of GM's truck-related plants heen working heavy overtime in recent months, which has put a strain on workers.
""General Motors are hard people to deal with,"" said Henry Summerville, a worker at the plant. ""They don't like to give up anything.""
In Janesville, UAW Local 95 said in a statement that it also struck over local issues because 44 bargaining sessions failed to produce an agreement.
Only a handful of GM's 123 locals have signed new local contracts with the automaker. The pacts typically cover items like work rules, staffing levels and health and safety standards, while the national agreement covers wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues.
Bargainers in the national talks reconvened at GM's headquarters here Tuesday after a day off Monday.
Still on the table in the talks is the future of 12 U.S. parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive, the company's top components executive confirmed Tuesday.
""We're talking about them in negotiations and I really don't want to talk about any labor issues at this time,"" said J.T. Battenberg, president of GM's Delphi Automotive Systems division.
Battenberg told reporters at an automotive supplier conference here that none of the 12 factories have improved their performance enough in recent months to be dropped from the company's list of troubled facilities.
GM has refused to identify the plants, but the list includes a door hinge and hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that the automaker intends to sell. Together, the plants employ 2,100 people.
The automaker wants to exclude several of the plants from the union's demand for employment guarantees. The UAW wants GM to follow a pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. and guarantee jobs for 95 percent of its UAW work force over the next three years.
The strikes mark a major departure in Yokich's bargaining strategy, which until last week had been marked by unusual conciliation and virtually no threats of strikes.
The walkouts could help pressure GM into a tentative national agreement before Saturday, when the UAW's National GM Council is scheduled to meet in Detroit. The 250-member council is made up of the top local officials from each GM local and plant bargaining unit.
Earlier Tuesday in New York, GM Chairman Jack Smith told reporters that he hoped there would be no local strikes.
The walkouts also came less than a week after Canadian Auto Workers members returned to work following a three-week strike over the issues of job security and outsourcing, or the shifting of work to outside contractors.
GM said Tuesday that 22,913 workers in its U.S. assembly, powertrain and stamping operations remained idle because of lingering shortages of Canadian-made parts.
The automaker said it laid off an additional 465 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, metal stamping plant Tuesday, one of four such plants affected.
"
7,"Investors pushed General Motors Corp. shares higher Monday, a sign that Wall Street is pleased that the auto giant signed a new national labour agreement that allows it to shed some workers.
GM's shares traded up $1.50 at $55.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company signed the tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union early Saturday morning.
""The Wall Street reaction reflects some belief that GM didn't cave in,"" said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. ""GM appears to have retained its right to manage and indulge in some outsourcing.""
Analysts said the pact will allow GM to reduce its 215,000-member hourly work force by 30,000 or more during the next three years through normal retirements.
The pact contains a nominal guarantee that GM maintain employment of about 95 percent of its current work force -- a pattern set in the Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. agreements -- but it also allows GM to exit some unprofitable parts businesses and sell certain components plants.
David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, said he believes the pact will help GM to to boost efficiency.
""GM can use attrition to shrink its work force and take advantage of productivity improvements,"" Cole said. ""The UAW has as much interest in a competitive General Motors as the shareholders do.""
But the positive reaction was tempered by a continuing strike at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where 4,809 workers walked off the job Oct. 29 over demands for more jobs.
The plant makes the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utilities, which are among GM's most popular -- and most profitable -- vehicles. UAW Local 95 wants GM to hire more workers in Janesville to reduce the strain of heavy overtime and an increasing workload.
On Sunday, members of UAW Local 23 returned to work at a key metal stamping plant in Indianapolis after ratifying a settlement on a new local contract.
The union members had struck for five days, shutting off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck assembly plants.
By the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio, and Linden, N.J.
GM said the Fort Wayne and Moraine plants are scheduled to resume normal operations Tuesday, while Shreveport and Linden will be running again by Thursday.
Last week, the UAW walkouts and lingering parts shortages from last month's Canadian Auto Workers strike had idled nearly 38,000 GM workers in the United States.
GM did not say how many workers were still idle, but added that four car plants stricken by the CAW strike will be back to full production by Tuesday, including Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Lake Orion and Lansing, Mich.
Healy estimated that between the two walkouts, GM's production losses will total 175,000 cars and trucks, which will slash the company's fourth-quarter profits by $600 million to $650 million.
In contrast to the tense atmosphere that continues to surround the GM labour situation, UAW President Stephen Yokich and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton signed a new three-year contract in an historic ceremony at the union's Detroit headquarters.
The signing marked the first time that a Big Three automaker has signed a new labour accord at the UAW's Solidarity House.
Yokich and Eaton were in a jovial mood as they signed the pact -- a stark contrast to the separate, grim-faced news conferences where the UAW and GM announced their deal early Saturday morning.
Yokich told reporters the Chrysler signing ""shows that this company recognises the union and wants to work with them.""
Meanwhile, GM declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share on its $1-2/3 par value common stock.
Some analysts had expected GM's board of directors to increase the annual payout to $2 a share from $1.60 because of its growing cash pile. But Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the board did not want to disrupt the UAW pact's ratification by giving more cash to shareholders.
"
7,"Labor negotiations between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers went around the clock into early Saturday morning as pressure from strike-related production losses mounted on the world's largest car maker.
Bargainers at GM's world headquarters were said to be haggling over a list of plants that GM wants to exclude from employment guarantees in the three-year national contract covering 215,000 hourly workers.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly work forces, but GM wants to exclude several parts plants from the guarantees, including a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., now on the sale block.
""It ain't done yet,"" one union negotiator at GM's Detroit headquarters said on Friday night.
GM spokesman Gerry Holmes declined to rule out a settlement early on Saturday, but would not characterize the progress of the discussions.
Bargainers struggled for nearly 45 hours from Wednesday through Friday over the proposed exceptions to the pattern, which was aimed at allowing GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, to cut costs and boost productivity.
Although all three of the companies pay a base wage of about $19 an hour, Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from lower-cost outside suppliers than GM does.
On Friday, the UAW signaled that the talks had hit a snag when it canceled a Saturday meeting of plant-level leaders here.
The UAW said its 250-member National GM Council is now scheduled to meet on Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Chicago if the union reaches a tentative agreement in the next few days. The cancellation was viewed as a negative sign for a quick settlement because it buys significantly more time to craft a deal.
Meanwhile, pressure from local strikes in Indiana and Wisconsin mounted early Saturday as the number of workers idled by the walkouts exceeded 19,000.
By late in the evening, workers at seven plants were idled, including 2,750 strikers in Indianapolis and 4,800 in Janesville, Wis.
The Indianapolis plant feeds fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck plants, including Janesville.
GM's Shreveport, La., compact pickup truck plant also shut down Friday, idling 2,400 workers, while GM's Linden, N.J., plant, which employs about 2,500 workers, was expected to run out of parts Friday night. Linden produces Chevrolet and GMC compact pickups and sport utility vehicles.
About 3,500 workers were idled at GM's Moraine, Ohio, compact sport utility vehicle plant Thursday night, while 2,250 workers were laid off at GM's Fort Wayne, Ind., full-size pickup truck assembly plant on Wednesday night.
In addition, 900 workers who build V-8 engines for trucks assembled in Janesville and Fort Wayne were idled on Friday.
Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber, said the Janesville, Fort Wayne and Moraine shutdowns alone will cost GM $10 million a day in after-tax lost profits.
""We're looking at $10 million a day right now, and that could easily expand to $20 million by Monday,"" Ward said.
Full-size pickup truck plants in Flint and Pontiac, Mich., and Oshawa, Ontario, could run out of parts within the next several days, while a GM truck plant in Silao, Mexico, was believed to have a greater supply of parts on hand.
Layoffs from the UAW strikes were increasing as GM's U.S. car operations are still staggering from the effects of the three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike, which ended Oct. 23.
GM said it still had 18,958 workers idled by continuing shortages of Canadian-made parts at six car assembly plants, six engine and transmission plants and four metal stamping facilities. Lost profits associated with the Canadian walkout are estimated at more than $350 million.
"
7,"General Motors Co. and the United Auto Workers recessed contract negotiations early Monday, several hours after their existing contract expired, but union officials said talks were likely to resume later in the day.
Union members continued working despite the impasse and UAW President Stephen Yokich said the union and GM officials planned to resume their talks, possibly later Monday.
Bargaining between the two sides recessed about 3 a.m. EST after the contract expired. The pact covers 215,000 UAW members who work at GM's U.S. facilities.
At a news conference Monday, Yokich made no mention of possible selective strikes at some GM plants, as had been speculated Sunday.
""We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,"" he said.
Yokich said a small number of bargainers may return to GM later Monday. Negotiators talked for about 17 hours Sunday and early Monday morning trying to reach a new agreement.
In a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM vice president of personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive.
""We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,"" Knechtel said.
The UAW has already reached a new three-year contract with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. covering about 171,000 UAW members in the United States.
Ford and Chrysler both agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current UAW workforces. Forcing GM to accept that pattern has been a sticking point for the UAW. The world's largest automaker has said it needs to shed about 12 North American parts plants that it says are uncompetitive, and wants to exclude those plants from any job guarantee pledges.
There was speculation Sunday the UAW may hit GM with selective strikes at plants that build GM's high-profit full-size pickup trucks and sport/utility vehicles, including facilities in Janesville, Wis., Pontiac and Flint, Mich., and Fort Wayne, Ind.
Yokich, who said he is disappointed with the progress of the talks, said some of the UAW's locals have ""sticky"" issues that are not yet resolved.
""We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,"" he said, declining to identify the locals.
The previous national labour agreement expired Sept. 14, but the UAW said in September it would extend the contract. Last week Yokich said the contract extension for GM would end at midnight Sunday.
Yokich defended his tactics against critics who say the union, which is facing a shrinking membership base, has not been tough enough on the Big Three automakers, whose profits and sales are both increasing.
GM has 12 parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.
GM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"
7,"Local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana began taking their toll on the rest of General Motors Corp.'s truck production Wednesday, clouding the automaker's national contract talks with the United Auto Workers.
GM said the day-old walkout at its Indianapolis metal stamping plant would force it to halt production of full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks at its Fort Wayne, Ind., assembly plant Wednesday night.
The Indianapolis walkout on Tuesday has halted shipments of major steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American truck assembly plants, threatening to shut them down within days.
Analysts said Wednesday the cost of the strikes by 2,750 workers in Indianapolis and 4,800 workers at its Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant could mount quickly, eating into profits from GM's lucrative light truck operations.
The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities.
The southern Wisconsin factory, which employs 4,800 workers, is the sole source for GM's popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes about $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks.
In addition to Janesville and Fort Wayne, the Indianapolis plant supplies facilities in Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio, and Silao, Mexico.
""It really starts to add up quickly when you add in all of the other big C/K pickups they can lose,"" said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi.
The UAW strikes came as GM is still staggering from a three-week strike in Canada that curtailed production at a number of U.S. plants and may cost up to $450 million.
On Wednesday, GM said it still had 23,158 U.S. workers idled due to shortages of Canadian-made parts, but added that 3,200 workers at its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to return to work on Thursday.
No other UAW strikes had started on Wednesday, but UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said the union was not ruling out other walkouts. UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after GM's national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers expired.
""Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own,"" McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout.
Some UAW officials speculated that other stamping and parts plants may also be struck, because they would force shutdowns at other facilities.
National contract talks continued Wednesday at GM's Detroit headquarters, but officials declined to say whether progress was being made.
""Talks are taking place at all levels,"" said GM spokesman Charles Licari.
Although UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement.
That may take place before Saturday, when about 250 UAW leaders from GM plants across the nation are scheduled to meet in Detroit to discuss the status of the talks.
The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations Wednesday. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs.
GM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.
""We know the sale is going to happen. We're concerned about what's going to happen to us,"" said Whitey Hale, president of UAW Local 326 in Flint.
"
7,"General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal for a job-preserving labour contract early Saturday, but the accord failed to halt costly local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana.
The three-year national agreement, which covers wages, benefits and job security for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers, did little to resolve contentious plant-specific issues that remain unresolved at most of the carmaker's 123 locals.
UAW President Stephen Yokich, announcing the pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of ""We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,"" Yokich said. ""I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up.""
President Clinton applauded the agreement. ""I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified, and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,"" he said.
On Tuesday night, about 2,750 workers walked off the job at GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant and 4,800 struck the company's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck assembly plant over local grievances, including demands for more workers to deal with increasing workloads.
The strike at Indianapolis cut off supplies of fenders, hoods, roofs and other steel body panels to nine GM North American truck plants. It threatened to paralyse much of GM's highly profitable light truck operations by early next week.
On Saturday, more than 19,000 workers at seven GM assembly and components plants were idled because of the two strikes. That comes on top of 18,958 U.S. workers still on layoff status because of lingering parts shortages from a three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike that ended Oct. 23.
Analysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of a $350 million loss from the Canadian walkout.
But the national UAW accord Saturday appeared to push negotiations in Janesville and Indianapolis forward. ""I think they've intensified their talks a bit,"" said an official at UAW Local 95 in Janesville.
UAW Local 292 officials also reported progress in local talks at GM's 5,500-employee Delco Electronics plant in Kokomo, Indiana. On Thursday, the unit sought Yokich's permission to join the other locals on strike.
The UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago.
The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council.
Details of the pact were not released Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by three percent raises in the second and third years of the contract.
Knechtel said GM will depend on its UAW workforce to gain efficiencies over the next three years. The company had been seeking the flexibility to shift more work to lower-cost outside suppliers.
""We feel we have the ability to make competitive improvements in the company. We will need to do that with the UAW,"" he said.
In a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they held made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building.
""I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,"" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. ""Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want.""
The talks were said to hit several snags during the past week over plants that GM wanted to exclude from the 95 percent employment guarantees. Among those were a door hinge plant in Flint, Michigan, and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Michigan, that the company has put on the sale block.
The proposed exceptions to the pattern were aimed at allowing GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, to cut costs and boost productivity.
Although all three of the companies pay a base wage of about $19 an hour, Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from lower-cost outside suppliers than GM does.
"
7,"Local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana began taking a larger toll on General Motors Corp. truck operations Wednesday, increasing pressure on the automaker for a new national contract with the United Auo Workers union.
GM said the walkout that started Tuesday night at its Indianapolis metal stamping plant forced the company to lay off 2,250 workers at its Fort Wayne, Ind., plant and halt production of full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks.
The plant ran out of hoods, doors, fenders and other major body panels made by striking workers in Indianapolis, said GM spokesman Jeffrey Kuhlman.
No other plants were in immediate danger of halting production Wednesday night, but the strikebound Indianapolis plant has stopped shipments to nine of GM's 11 North American truck assembly plants, threatening more shutdowns within days.
Meanwhile talks between GM and UAW bargainers continued late into the night Wednesday in an effort to reach a new national agreement covering 215,000 GM hourly workers. Company officials declined to comment on progress of the negotiations.
Analysts said Wednesday the cost of the strikes by 2,750 workers in Indianapolis and 4,800 workers at its Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant could mount quickly, eating into profits from GM's lucrative light truck operations.

""Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own,"" McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout.
Some UAW officials speculated that other stamping and parts plants may also be struck but others expressed concern that widespread walkouts so close to next week's national election would hurt Democratic candidates.
Although UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement.

"
7,"United Auto Workers bargainers reconvened at General Motors Corp.'s headquarters Tuesday following a day off Monday, but talks between the two sides maintained a low profile, UAW and company spokesmen said.
UAW workers continued to report to their jobs at GM's U.S. factories, despite the expiration of their national labour agreement with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday.
GM spokesman Charles Licari said there were no major ""main-table"" meetings scheduled Tuesday, but key negotiators were communicating in small groups and by telephone.
""Discussions are taking place, but there is no set timetable regarding the negotiations,"" Licari said, adding that such communications still may prove fruitful.
A person close to the talks said, however, that he did not expect the situation to change much before Saturday, when the union's key local GM plant-level leaders are scheduled to meet in Detroit.
UAW President Stephen Yokich recessed the talks on Monday and expressed disappointment with the lack of progress toward a settlement, but he refrained from calling a strike against the world's largest automaker.
Still, Yokich said some of the union's GM locals may resort to strikes if progress in local negotiations does not improve. In addition to the national contract, GM is negotiating with more than 100 UAW locals for pacts that cover plant-specific issues.
In New York on Tuesday, GM Chairman Jack Smith said little about the UAW negotiations, but told reporters that he hoped there would be no local strikes.
The threat of additional strikes comes less than a week after Canadian Auto Workers members returned to work following a three-week walkout over the issues of job security and outsourcing, or the shifting of work to outside contractors.
Smith, speaking at a news conference on alternative fuel vehicles, declined to specify the dollar cost of the strike.
""We lost quite a few cars,"" he said.
GM said Tuesday that 22,913 workers in its U.S. assembly, powertrain and stamping operations remained idle because of lingering shortages of Canadian-made parts.
The automaker said it laid off an additional 465 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, metal stamping plant Tuesday, one of four such plants affected.
GM's nearby Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant remains completely idled, as does its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich. Five other assembly plants remain partially idled, bringing GM's laid off assembly workers to 15,284.
GM has 5,702 engine and transmission workers laid off, with six such powertrain plants partially idled.
In the UAW talks, which cover a total of 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, GM has resisted the union's demand that it follow a pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. and guarantee jobs for 95 percent of current work force over the next three years.
GM wants to exclude from the guarantee several parts plants that it wants to sell. The automaker has identified 12 facilities that it considers uncompetitive.
GM's stock gained 50 cents to $54.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

17,"Germany and the Czech Republic on Friday concluded nearly two years of sensitive talks on a joint declaration aimed at finally healing the wounds of World War Two and the communist era that followed.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec signed a protocol which sends forward a text expressing regret for injustices on both sides, and setting up a fund for joint projects.
The declaration expresses Bonn's sorrow for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague's regret for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans.
It marks Germany's final reconciliation with neighbours who fell under Nazi occupation.
""We Germans regret the suffering and injustice caused to the Czech people by National-Socialist (Nazi) crimes, and we are recognising our responsibility,"" Kinkel told diplomats and journalists after signing the protocol.
The text was approved by both governments earlier this week, and is to be signed by prime ministers in January, but politicians on both sides of the border are calling for changes before parliaments and presidents give it their final approval.
Both Kinkel and Zielenec insisted the text would not be reopened for negotiation.
Czech opponents of the text claim it fails to pay direct compensation to victims of Nazi agression, while German groups are furious that it avoids paying restitution for Prague's expropriation of property of the so-called Sudeten Germans.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.
The text says the fund is to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific ones, adding that ""the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of victims of (Nazi) violence.""
""The declaration which we have agreed on means simply a clarification of understanding,"" Zieleniec said.
""This declaration is not a full stop after history. It only closes one sentence and one paragraph. It also is a semi-colon and starts a discussion on the topic of joint projects focused on the future,"" he added.
The main political critic in Germany is the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU) which acts as mentor to the Sudeten Germans, survivors and relatives of the 2.5 million ethnic Germans who were collectively blamed for the Nazi occupation and summarily driven out.
Leaders of Bavaria, where most Sudetens settled, had demanded changes in the text, but the Czech government has insisted it will negotiate only with Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is due to sign the declaration with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in January and the presidents of the two countries will then address each other's parliaments to seal the matter.
A major German daily newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, on Friday called the declaration a political sham.
""Perhaps one day there will be a German-Czech declaration which in its honesty and sincerity does provide a historic sign of reconciliation,"" the daily said in a commentary.
""The great majority of the Czech nation, above all the great majority of politicians, is convinced that the Czechoslovak state was not only politically clever but also morally and legally in the right when it got rid of the German minority."" ($1=1.5570 Mark)

17,"Czech fund manager Harvard Capital &amp; Consulting (HC&amp;C) said on Tuesday it paid a one million crown ($36,500) fine for illegal trading practices from 1993 to 1995, and was making amends.
In a statement HC&amp;C said that Viktor Kozeny, the young Czech-born entreprenuer who founded HC&amp;C, which is not connected to the U.S. college where he once studied, confirmed from his home in the Bahamas that the fine was paid in June.
""The discovered deficiencies from 1993 to 1995 have mostly been removed. We are working on correcting the others,"" HC&amp;C vice-president Boris Vostry said in the statement obtained from Harvard's Prague public relations agency.
The Finance Ministry on Monday said it had levied the maximum fine allowed by Czech law on HC&amp;C, which became one of the most visible symbols of renascent Czech capitalism during the country's privatisation wave of the early 1990s.
The firm was cited for several violations of the law on investment companies and funds and forced it to pay additional compensation, the ministry said, but did not elaborate.
Marie Jezkova, the head of the ministry's department of fund supervision, told Reuters that Harvard was cited primarily for the manipulation of assets of its publicly-held closed-end Harvard Guarantee &amp; Multiple Fund.
She said that the violations included ""dealing with the assets of the fund with unprofessional care"".
Jezkova said that Harvard conducted trades which ""did not indicate that they were done with the aim to increase the value of the assets of the fund"".
Vostry said one of the reasons for the fine was the frequent encroachment of the maximum limits for the purchase of shares in individual companies.
At the time, funds were limited to holding a maximum 20 percent stake in any one company.
Vostry did not list other infractions.
Jezkova was reacting to repeated inquiries concerning a story published last week in the U.S. magazine Fortune.
The magazine quoted a still unpublished ministry decision which it said was handed down in July, which required Harvard to pay a one million crown penalty and $6.8 million in compensation to its funds for various activities.
Jezkova declined comment on the total amount of compensation Harvard was required to pay, but she said that the ministry did impose the maximum fine allowable by law, and that Harvard did have to pay additional compensation.
She also declined to discuss any details of the decision, and said it was up others at the ministry to publish such information.
It is not clear why the decision had been kept secret.
Key ministry personnel have been unavailable during the holiday season.
The infractions described by Fortune concern Harvard's management of funds which were set up during the massive Czech voucher privatisation programme, which gave share vouchers to citizens for a nominal fee.
Kozeny, like many banks and private entrepreneurs, set up funds based on shares gained from citizens who transferred their vouchers to the funds. The citizens received shares in the funds for the vouchers.

17,"The Czech crown firmed on Thursday to its highest level against its mark/dollar basket, buoyed by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus' comments that devaluation was not needed despite a widening trade gap.
By mid-morning the crown moved to around 4.3 percent above its daily parity rate set by the Czech National Bank (CNB) against the dollar/mark basket from a four percent level in the morning.
The crown stood at 26.005 to the dollar and 17.600 to the mark at 1130 GMT.
The CNB followed the market up, fixing the crown 4.24 percent above parity with the basket after +3.9 percent on Wednesday.
Dealers said the crown could challenge 4.5 percent against parity before levelling off to end the week.
""Probably we will attack 4.5 percent (over parity),"" Tomas Becvar, dealer at Prague's Komercni Banka, told Reuters.
Although the Czech trade balance earlier this week showed a record monthly deficit in July of 16.4 billion crowns, the market was encouraged by Klaus's comments.
""The first (reason for the crown's rise) is Klaus's comments in Austria,"" Becvar said. ""Another reason of course is the following of the market by the central bank at the fixing.""
At an economic conference in Austria, Klaus backed the CNB's Governor Josef Tosovsky view that a stronger crown would be better for the economy in the long-term.
""We think that a devaluation is not necessary and that it wouldn't be useful,"" Klaus told Reuters.
While some economists have recommended devaluing the crown to help the trade situation, many said it is not fundamentally necessary as capital inflows remain strong and the balance of services, especially toursim, softens the current account gap.
The Czech currency last dipped below the parity rate against the basket in mid-June, soon after elections stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority in parliament and strenghthend the hand of the opposition Social Democrats.
But since then, the Czech currency has been on a steady march up, first hovering around three percent against the basket, then surging after Tosovsky's comments last Friday.
Klaus was finally able to form a minority government of his centre-right coalition while the centre-left Social Democrats have been concilliatory on economic issues, including a 9.3 billion crown cut in spending to balance this year's budget.
Dealers said positive preliminary results on Thursday for July's industrial production, showing a moderate recovery from disappointing June figures, also helped the crown.

17,"Czech Unipetrol a.s. on Wednesday announced a long-awaited plan to convert shares in Kaucuk a.s. and Chemopetrol a.s. into Unipetrol shares.
In a joint statement the boards of Chemopetrol, Kaucuk and Unipetrol, the country's new petrochemical holding company, said they agreed to swap one Chemopetrol share for between 1.05 to 1.20 Unipetrol shares, and one Kaucuk share for between 1.10 to 1.25 Unipetrol shares.
The plan, to complete the complex partial privatisation of the two largest Czech petrochemical concerns, was agreed at a meeting on Tuesday of the respective boards, but an exact ratio must still be approved by general shareholders meetings.
Kaucuk and Chemopetrol shares have traded virtually level for months as investors hoped for possible arbitrage trades if either firm's shares got an advantage in the swap.
Ahead of the news on Wednesday, Kaucuk shares were fixed 11 crowns above Tuesday's close on the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) at 1,105, while Chemopetrol finished the PSE's Wednesday trading session 12 crowns higher at 1,106.
The Unipetrol statement said the ratio range was determined by ""the current results of appraising the assets and liabilities of the involved companies.""
Equities analysts said that because the announced range of the conversion still allowed for overlap in the final decision and did not give a clear advantage to one company's shares, immediate arbitrage possibilities were slim.
But they said that the fact that the boards were nearing a decision on a very complicated issue should give a mild boost to shares in Kaucuk and Chemopetrol.
""I don't see any arbitrage opportunity at this moment,"" said Patria Finance's Miroslav Nosal. ""But now that the exchange ratio is being announced, I believe it will help the shares in both companies.""
Tomas Michalek, at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Prague, agreed that the movement toward a decision would be a plus to the shares.
""What is positive is that they agreed on a ratio (range). It's important so that both companies can finally be folded into Unipetrol and more foreign capital can come in,"" Michalek said.
Under a complicated privatisation of the Czech petrochemical industry, Kaucuk and Chemopetrol's refining operations were merged into a subsidiary of the newly-created Unipetrol last year called Ceska Rafinerska a.s..
Unipetrol, in which the government currently holds a 100 percent stake, has a 51 percent stake in Ceska Rafinerska,
The IOC consortium -- comprising U.S. Du Pont de Nemours unit Conoco, Royal Dutch/Shell, and Italy's Agip SpA -- acquired a 49 percent stake in Rafinerska under agreement with the government last year.
The share swap would complete the transfer of the rest of Kaucuk and Chemopetrol as subsidiaries under Unipetrol, which acts as a holding company, and would dilute the state's 100 percent stake in Unipetrol.' -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003

17,"Czech President Vaclav Havel said on Thursday he was deeply disturbed by a Chinese court's 11-year prison sentence on dissident Wang Dan on charges of plotting to overthrow the government.
Havel, himself a former dissident against a Communist government, said in a statement that after last year's jailing of Wei Jingsheng, father of China's small democracy movement, on similar subversion charges, Wang's sentence was ""unacceptable"".
Wang, 27, was jailed for 11 years on Wednesday after a brief hearing.
Wei Jingsheng, freed in 1993 after serving all but six months of an earlier 15-year term for subversion, was rearrested the following year and formally sentenced in December 1996 to another 14-year term. He is now 47.
Havel's statement, issued by his spokesman, said that Wang's sentence ""was another example of the unacceptable understanding of the position of the citizen in society.""
The statement added that Havel expressed his ""deep dissatisfaction"" over the decision.
It said Havel ""considers it his obligation to express his solidarity with those who anywhere around the world express, in a non-violent way, their free-mindedness and desire for justice and elementary human rights.""
Havel, who as a dissident playwright was imprisoned several times by the Communist government before its fall in 1989, has been a frequent diplomatic thorn in China's side.
He angered China last year with a highly publicised meeting with Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan, forcing a hurried restatement of the Czechs' official ""One-China Policy"".
Earlier this year the Czech president said that he regretted that Chinese Nationalist-ruled Taiwan, which Bejing regards as a renegade province, is not a U.N. member. However, the Czechs officially still recognise only China as a sovereign state.
Earlier on Thursday, the Czech Foreign Ministry called in China's chief diplomat in Prague, charge d'affaires Wang Zizhen, to read him a statement of protest.
""The Czech Republic expresses its dissatisfaction over the conduct of the trial and the judgment carried out,"" said a text of the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.
It said that, although there were differences in traditions of understanding questions of human rights in different regions, ""there exist certain universal principles of maintaining human rights which are necessary to respect"".
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said in Beijing on Thursday that the jailing was not a human rights issue but an ordinary legal matter.
The Czech ministry statement said, however, that criminalisation of freedom of speech was ""a violation of elementary human rights"".

17,"Volkswagen AG Czech unit, Skoda Auto a.s., on Friday launched sales of its new sedan, the Octavia, hoping to kill off jokes about Communist-era quality, and pull the company into profit.
Officials said the new model, built on a common VW platform designed for the 1998 Audi A3 and upgraded Golf, would expand Skoda's market penetration by putting the company's first post-Communist mid-sized car in showrooms worldwide.
""Our strategic markets are in central and eastern Europe, western Europe, and we are present in some Asian markets. We expect to sell Octavias successfully in all of our 66 markets,"" marketing director Frank Farsky told Reuters.
The new sedan received a hero's welcome at showrooms around the capital Prague on Friday as crowds gathered to watch dealers mount the Octavia on viewing pedestals.
Exports of the front-grilled Octavia -- a major step away from the boxy sub-compacts which made the Communist-era Skoda the butt of automotive jokes worldwide -- to Europe and beyond later this year or in the first quarter next year.
The car will be available on the domestic market with a choice of three petrol and two diesel engines, with the top-of-the-line SLX automatic model priced at 497,900 crowns, and a base model priced at 335,700 crowns.
""In the Czech market its more or less toward a luxury- class car by the nature the purchasing power and the nature of the car market itself,"" Farsky said.
""In western Europe it is a medium sized car that will belong to the middle class market, and in Asian markets I think it will be toward the luxury class,"" he added.
Skoda will make 64,000 Octavias in 1997 at its new purpose-built plant in Mlada Boleslav north of Prague, and raise production to 90,000 in 1998.
Skoda Chairman Ludvik Kalma said earlier this year he expected 20,000 Octavias to be sold annually on the home market, with the rest exported to Europe and points East.

17,"The Czech crown rose on Thursday to its highest level against its mark/dollar basket, buoyed by comments by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus that devaluation was not needed despite a widening trade gap.
The crown rose to 4.5 percent above the cross rate of the two-currency basket late in the afternoon and dealers said that, barring any central bank intervention, the newly-liberalised currency could go still higher.
By mid-morning heavy buying had pushed the Czech currency to 4.3 percent above the basket from just under four percent at the opening.
The crown strengthened to 26.014 to the dollar and 17.591 to the mark by 1430 GMT from Thursday's central bank fixing of 26.039 and 17.638.
The central bank followed the market up at its midday fixing, setting the crown at 4.24 percent above parity with the basket, compared with 3.9 percent on Wednesday.
Traders saw the fixing as a signal that the bank was content with the crown's rise and the market responded.
""When the central bank followed the market, the banks realised it was still time to sell (foreign) currencies again and the central bank won't be taking any action,"" said trader Tomas Novak at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.
Traders said as long as the government kept talking up the crown, foreign investors would respond until the bank decided to jump in and buy foreign currency.
The catalyst for recent strength of the crown has been official comments dismissing any need to devalue the currency.
Although the trade balance showed a record monthly deficit in July of 16.4 billion crowns, the market responded to comments made by Klaus in Austria late on Wednesday.
""The first (reason for the crown's rise) is Klaus's comments in Austria,"" Tomas Becvar, trader at Komercni Banka, said. ""Another reason of course is the following of the market by the central bank at the fixing.""
At an economic conference, Klaus backed central bank Governor Josef Tosovsky's view that a stronger crown would be better for the economy in the long term.
""We think that a devaluation is not necessary and that it wouldn't be useful,"" Klaus told Reuters in Alpbach, Austria.
While some economists have recommended devaluing the crown to help the trade position, many said it was not fundamentally necessary as capital inflows remain strong and the balance of services, especially tourism, narrows the current account gap.
The Czech currency last dipped below the parity rate against the basket in mid-June, soon after elections stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority in parliament and strengthened the hand of the opposition Social Democrats.
Klaus was finally able to form a minority government of his centre-right coalition while the centre-left Social Democrats have been conciliatory on economic issues, including a 9.3 billion crown cut in spending to balance this year's budget.
The crown has since been on a steady upward path, first hovering around three percent against the basket in recent weeks, then surging after comments by Tosovsky's on Friday.
Since February, the central bank has had the option of fixing the crown in a band of plus/minus 7.5 percent from parity with the basket instead of its previous tightly controlled plus/minus 0.5 percent band,
The move brought the crown more in line with supply and demand on the open market.

17,"The ancient Czech capital has suffered invasions of dictators and demonstrators but nothing and no-one so extraordinary as Michael Jackson and his cohorts.
The controversial and self-styled ""King of Pop"" plays his first concert in two years when the ""HiStory"" world tour starts on Saturday on Prague's Letna Plain, where Communist leaders once reviewed troops and Pope John Paul II held mass.
On Tuesday, Jackson is expected to receive the kind of welcome usually reserved for heads of state when his jet lands at Prague's VIP terminal and he is wisked away in a Rolls Royce.
This tour is Jackson's first since he was cleared of child molestation charges by a U.S. court because of lack of evidence.
Like Britain's Queen Elizabeth in May, he will get a full police escort through the ancient Czech capital, but not even monarchs can compete with the huge fleet of luxury cars readied to carry the star's entourage.
Police have asked Czechs to stay away from the airport, but officials have encouraged well-wishers to come out and wave along the 15 km (10 mile) route into the city.
Jackson's Prague date has avoided the controversy at other stops on his three-month tour through Europe, Africa and Asia.
In South Korea, civic and religious groups reacted bitterly to a decision to let Jackson play two concerts in Seoul in October, saying it was unbelievable that the government agreed to to make an ""amoral singer"" the teenagers' idol.
A planned stop in Casablanca was cancelled by Moroccan authorities, without explanation. A concert organiser said the government did not want 100,000 youths all in the same place.
Jackson's Prague promoter, Serge Grimaux, said the normally reclusive Jackson wanted to arrive several days before the concert to mix with the thousands who throng the bridges and palaces of the Bohemian capital ""like a normal tourist"".
""He has a big interest in meeting people and doesn't want to be too incognito,"" Grimaux told reporters.
For those who don't see enough of Jackson, organisers are planning to erect a 10-metre (33 foot) water-filled statue of the singer on the same rock platform hovering above Prague where a monument to Soviet-leader Josef Stalin once stood.
Never before has the sprawling parade ground adjacent to Prague Castle prepared for a spectacle like the one planned for the expected 130,000 paying guests on Saturday.
Huge walls for two security perimeters -- to keep out those not paying the $21 for a ticket -- are being built on the Letna grounds which usually host ball fields, car parks, and a major east-west thoroughfare.
""I'm not building Alcatraz, I'm just building a perimeter for the people that have paid for their tickets to get what they deserve,"" Grimaux said.

17,"The health of Czech President Vaclav Havel has improved considerably as he recuperates from lung cancer surgery last week, his spokesman said on Sunday.
Havel, 60, who had a small malignant tumour removed along with half of his right lung on December 2, required an emergency tracheostomy on Thursday to connect a respirator through his throat after he developed severe breathing problems.
""The worst is behind us,"" presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek told Czech Radio on Sunday. ""The tendency, the return to improvement (in Havel's health) is distinct, and we hope it will continue into the future.""
Spacek took the place of Havel on the president's regular national Sunday radio programme.
The president had hoped to record at least a sentence for the show, but his condition on Sunday morning, when it was was recorded, kept him to the role of a listener, Czech radio said.
The president has been communicating by writing notes to doctors and his staff.
Czech Archbishop Miloslav Vlk led a national prayer mass for Havel on Sunday at St Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle.
Dozens of friends and leaders around the world, including U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, have sent get-well wishes to the hero of Prague's non-violent 1989 revolution over communism.
Havel, a heavy smoker, entered the Third Surgical Clinic in central Prague on November 25 after his office said he had been suffering from pneumonia.
After the surgery, he developed pneumonia in the opposite lung and had been fighting a fever, but his spokesman said on Sunday that Havel's temperature had returned to normal.
Doctors say Havel will probably remain connected to the respirator another four to six days, and if his recovery goes well, he might be back to work as soon as mid-January.
The former dissident-playwright who helped lead Prague's so-called ""Velvet Revoution"" over communism has limited executive powers as president, and did not relinquish any of his duties during his surgery or his recovery.

17,"A stronger showing by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's centre-right Civic Democratic Party in the first round of Senate elections may give a mild fillip to local financial markets, Czech analysts predicted.
But a thin turnout made it hard for the three-party coalition government, which lost its lower house majority in June, to claim it had recaptured voters' hearts, the analysts said.
""Nobody can jump to conclusions based on these figures, because if you take the total turnout, it's nothing,"" said Radek Maly, economist at Citibank Prague.
""We might see a mild strengthening of the crown, but we don't think any major movement,"" he added.
The currency has traded in a tight range recently at around 26.9 to the dollar and 17.8 to the mark or roughly 2.5 percent above parity with the central bank's mark/dollar basket.
But Maly stressed that the market was focused on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences.
Klaus's Civic Democratic Party won 36 percent of the nationwide vote on Saturday.
The centre-left opposition Social Democrats were second with 20 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists. Only 35 percent of the electorate voted.
Of the 81 Senate seats, Civic Democrats won three outright in the first round and 73 of their candidates go into next weekend's runoff as the top vote getter in their district.
The Civic Democrats took less that 30 percent of the vote in June's general elections, costing the coalition its majority in the lower house.
Miroslav Nosal, equities analyst at Prague investment house Patria Finance, said that a premature general election was probably not on the cards, and said the stock market had other concerns than party politics.
""Poor regulation and transparency is already included in the share prices, but from a fundamental point of view many stocks are quite attractive,"" said Nosal,
He said some foreign investors might be tempted to play on Klaus's victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.

31,"A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a jury verdict that ordered Nintendo Co. Ltd. to pay $253 million for patent infringement.
With interest, the company could have been forced to pay nearly $300 million to tiny Alpex Computer Corp. for a technology allegedly used in the hugely popular Nintendo Entertainment System game device, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln said in an interview.
But in a 16-page decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., overturned the jury's decision that the Alpex patent had been infringed.
""It's a complete victory,"" Lincoln said. ""I think our nightmare with these folks is over.""
Alpex, which Lincoln described as a bankrupt mining concern, filed suit in 1986, charging Nintendo's 8-bit game device used a patented ""bitmapping"" display technology patented by two Alpex engineers in 1977.
In 1994 a U.S. District Court jury agreed and ordered Nintendo to pay a 6 percent royalty on each of the more than 35 million game units sold in the United States.
But a three-judge panel of the appeals court in Washington, which handles patent cases, said in a 16-page decision it found a ""lack of substantial evidence to support a finding of infringement either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.""
Alpex's technology was used in early generation video games made by Mattel, Atari and Coleco. The company later won patent infringement settlements from Sega Enterprises Ltd. and others.
But with the appeal victory Nintendo preserved what Lincoln said was a perfect record of fighting in court to protect its intellectual property rights.
Lincoln said the case ""cries out for a change"" in the patent litigation system because it required a jury of laymen to sit through an eight-week trial that hinged on complex technical details of data storage and image display.
""The problem is you ask these juries to in effect become electrical engineers, and quite frankly the jury was not composed of electrical engineers,"" Lincoln said.
He also said the case was kept alive by lawyers working on a contingency-fee basis who stood to make huge profits.
While Alpex could appeal to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court, Lincoln said he was confident Nintendo would prevail.
Lawyers for Alpex could not be reached for comment.

31,"Software giant Microsoft Corp. MSFT.N  plans to pay dividends to stockholders for the first time through a new issue of preferred shares, according to documents filed Monday.
The hugely profitable company, which has not paid dividends in its 10 years as a public company but has hoarded a cash pile that has grown to more than $7 billion, said it planned to issue $750 million worth of the new class of stock.
""We are responding to the desire of some investors for an income-yielding stock, while still allowing them to participate to a significant degree in the growth potential of our company,"" Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said in a statement.
The preferred shares will protect investors against risk, guaranteeing they will get back their principal in cash or common stock at the end of three years along with quarterly dividends that will be specified at the time of the offering.
But investors will have only a limited opportunity to enjoy the kind of stock appreciation available to owners of Microsoft common stock, which has risen nearly 80 percent this year.
The value of the preferred shares will be capped at a percentage to be established when the offering is completed. Similar convertible preferred shares have been capped at 25 percent to 30 percent growth.
In the past, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and other board members have resisted calls for a common stock dividend, saying the fast-moving computer business required high research spending levels and the flexibility to make large acquisitions if needed.
Treasurer Greg Maffei said the planned issue of preferred shares was consistent with that philosophy, noting that the $750 million would represent less than 1 percent of the company's market capitalization.
""We dont believe the bulk of our investors want a common dividend,"" Maffei said. ""We believe that the best use of (cash) is to reinvest in the business. On the other hand we do understand that some investors want a common dividend, and we created a security that offers them the opportunity to become investors in Microsoft.""
The amount of the offering could rise to $862.5 million if underwriters Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley exercise options, Microsoft said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pending SEC approval the offering could be completed in the next several weeks.
"
31,"Boeing Co.'s stunning agreement to acquire longtime rival McDonnell Douglas Corp. won a ringing endorsement from Wall Street and sent shock waves through the aerospace industry Monday.
Stock in both companies soared on expectations the deal would boost Boeing's operating profits immediately after its completion, targeted for mid-1997.
Boeing rose $4.375 to $101.125 and McDonnell Douglas jumped $10.375 to $62.375, down from earlier highs on the New York Stock Exchange but good enough to give the all-stock transaction an indicated value of nearly $14 billion.
Industry analysts saw few obstacles to the deal, which marks a startling transformation for a company that just a year ago was completing a final round of cutbacks that had slashed its work force by 30 percent in five years.
Since then Boeing has completed the $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s  ROK.N defence and space business, won the right to compete for the richest military contract in Pentagon history and announced orders for a record $45.6 billion in new commercial jets.
""It's an incredible turnaround story,"" said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, which specialises in aerospace. ""These are very bold, dramatic, uncharacteristic moves for Boeing and I applaud them for it.""
While Boeing had been moving to cut costs and transform its management style under outgoing Chairman Frank Shrontz, the pace has accelerated at the once-sluggish company since Phil Condit was named chief executive officer in April.
Condit began the final round of merger negotiations with McDonnell Douglas last Tuesday, just a day after being formally elected Boeing chairman as of Feb. 1, 1997.
""We're seeing Boeing evolve from kind of a stodgy company to being very aggressive, nimble,"" said Bill Whitlow, a longtime Boeing analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who praised Condit's energy and stamina.
Executives at the two companies said the deal would be additive to operating profits immediately and reiterated their prediction that Boeing could achieve $1 billion in annual savings without any layoffs because of rapid growth.
Analysts said the merger was a good strategy for McDonnell Douglas, which already had announced plans to pull back from commercial aviation when it was eliminated from bidding for the Pentagon's 21st century joint strike fighter.
But Harry Stonecipher, chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, denied that the merger was born of desperation.
""This is the deal we wanted and we are very happy with it,"" Stonecipher told CNBC. ""This is the only deal we considered.""
Boeing executives told analysts they had no immediate plans to make further acquisitions, even though the combined company will generate cash flow of more than $4 billion a year on projected 1997 revenue of $48 billion.
The surprise merger immediately turned up the heat on Europe's Airbus Industrie to move ahead quickly with a restructuring plan. Without such a plan, the consortium would be unable to go ahead with a proposed super-jumbo aircraft to compete with Boeing's 747, which now is unchallenged at the profitable top end of the market, analysts said.
""Airbus Industrie and its partners must agree as soon as possible on an optimal structure that will allow Airbus Industrie to match its American competitors as a powerful, integrated European enterprise,"" German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in a statement.
Analysts noted that Boeing had ended any chance that Airbus would partner with McDonnell on a new large jet, and some said Boeing's own plans to stretch the 747 might now be deferred.
But both Airbus and Boeing could benefit from stabilised airplane prices with the No. 3 player out of the market.
Despite some overlapping businesses, including helicopters, rockets and missiles, experts saw little possibility the deal would be stopped by the Defence Department, although the combination of the nation's only manufacturers of commercial jets could give pause to federal antitrust regulators.
""It will be interesting to see what the airlines have to say about this,"" said Don Baker, a former antitrust official now with the firm Baker and Miller in Washington.
""It's worth remembering that there would be just two players in the worldwide market for big planes,"" he said. ""But maybe two is enough competition for the airlines.""
On the defence side, analysts said they expected the marriage of Boeing and McDonnell to spur further consolidation, with players such as Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. looking for partners.
Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said the deal gives Raytheon, which supplies missile systems, ""a window of opportunity"" to buy Hughes Electronics Corp..
""It's not a long-term window,"" he said. ""It will probably last until the (Boeing-McDonnell) deal is closed.""
"
31,"After months of denying that a $500 Internet appliance would pose a threat to its industry dominance, Microsoft Corp. plans to announce a new push for inexpensive, easy-to-use personal computers.
Microsoft is working with Intel Corp. and major compouter manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. on the intiative and will announce details at a conference Monday, said a spokesman for the software giant, confirming a published report.
The announcement will come one day before the widely anticipated unveiling of an $800 device from Microsoft rival Sun Microsystems Inc.
The Sun product is among the first of an expected flurry of appliance-like devices dubbed network computers being positioned as Internet-friendly alternatives to PCs based on the ""Wintel"" standard of Microsoft Windows and Intel processors.
While Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and other executives have downplayed the threat from network computers, they have been scrambling to come up with ways to make personal computers easier to use for home consumers and cheaper to maintain for businesses.
""They and Intel have certainly heard the network computer mantra and have discovered a new religion,"" said Rob Enderle, an industry analyst with Giga Information Group.
""The threat is very real,"" he said. ""Particularly for the (corporate) community, the concern surrounding the cost of managing multiple Wintel systems has been driving them to consider other alternatives.""
At the same time personal computer penetration into the home appears to be hitting a plateau far short of other mass-market electronic devices.
In a report early this year that set off alarm bells throughout the industry, Dataquest forecast sharply slowing growth. The research group predicted PCs would be in 38 percent of U.S. homes by 1999, compared with 29 percent last year.
But since Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison and other executives began publicizing the network computer a little over a year ago, Microsoft officials routinely have minimized its importance.
""We dont think it's likely that Internet appliances, network computers or whatever you call them are going to displace the PC anytime soon,"" Gates told a Harvard University audience in May.
At the same time Microsoft has been stepping up efforts to make the PC easier to use, acknowledging the machines are dauntingly complex for many consumers.
In April Gates unveiled a set of technologies for what Microsoft called the ""Simply Interactive PC,"" which he said would make the personal computer ""as easy and convenient to use as other home appliances.""
Monday's announcement apparently will go further to bring consumers lower prices, which are being made possible by falling prices of memory and other components.
""They're validating the proposition we've been taking to the market for the last year,"" said Jon Kannegaard, vice president of software products for Sun's JavaSoft unit.
Jesse Berst, executive editor of Windows Watcher, an industry newsletter, agreed that Microsoft was late to acknowledge the importance of network computers.
""They're awful late to respond to what has been a very, very strong message from customers,"" he said.
""If they had been doing what they should have been doing, which is really driving down prices aggressively, they wouldn't have been in the position where someone has the opportunity to come and take their franchise away.""
"
31,"Pyramid Breweries Inc.  PMIDO Tuesday warned of lower-than-expected sales and earnings for the fourth quarter, blaming increasing competition in the craft beer industry.
Seattle-based Pyramid said sales would be 20 percent to 25 percent below last year's levels on a wholesale basis and said it expected to just break even for the quarter, compared with analysts' projections it would earn 9 cents a share.
In last year's fourth quarter, the company posted gross sales of $7 million and net income of about $1 million, or 13 cents a share.
Pyramid's warning was the latest to roil the trendy craft beer industry, which has disappointed investors who snapped up stock sold in a spree of offerings over the past two years.
Pyramid stock, which went public at $19 as Hart Brewing Co. in December 1995, fell 12.5 cents after the announcement to $4.125 a share in Nasdaq trading. It ended an abbreviated trading session 25 cents lower at $4.
Pyramid's crosstown rival, Redhook Ale Brewery Inc. , which just last week warned of weak sales, was trading at $10.625 on Nasdaq, compared with its August 1995 offering price of $17 a share and a peak of $35.
Boston Beer Co., maker of Samuel Adams beer, was trading at $10 on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with an offering price of $20 little more than a year ago and a peak of $33.
Brewers have blamed tough competition, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, where the premium-priced beers have caught on most quickly with consumers.
But market share for craft beers may have peaked in many of those initial markets, while an increasing number of varieties crowd grocery store coolers.
""Not a lot of new consumers are trying craft beers any more,"" said analyst Diane Daggatt of Dain Bosworth, referring to more mature markets. ""The people who are going to try them have tried them. They just haven't built any brand loyalty.""
She said about 400 craft brewers nationwide were distributing beer, up from 300 just a year ago. And brewers are adding more specialty beers, increasing competition and confusing consumers.
While breweries have been offering promotional discounts, analyst Scott McAdams of brokerage Ragen MacKenzie said the industry may be ripe for more serious price cuts and consolidation.
""People are going to have to think about addressing the price issue and spending more on marketing,"" he said. ""They're going to have to play the beer game more than they have been playing the beer game.""
But analysts said there was still a lot of room for growth in new markets. Nationally, craft beers account for about 3 percent of sales, compared with 8 percent to 10 percent in markets such as Portland and Seattle, she said.
"
31,"Airbus Industrie's preliminary restructuring agreement may help the consortium become more efficient, but poses no near-term threat to Boeing Co's market dominance, industry analysts said Friday.
Although details of the Airbus agreement were not revealed, it appeared to represent a step forward from last July's announcement that the four-nation consortium would be transformed into a single corporate entity by 1999.  
""I think it's a step in the right direction,"" said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities. ""They have a good franchise and they are going to be a contender.""
Pressure on Airbus to act has increased since last month's stunning news that Boeing plans to acquire McDonnell Douglas Corp, its last remaining U.S. rival in commercial jets.
Analysts say Airbus needs to streamline its unwieldy management structure to have any hope of competing with highly centralized and rapidly expanding Boeing, which has access to enormous resources and the ability to subcontract work around the world.  
""If they are much more like a private company than they are now, certainly it would be to their benefit,"" said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research.
Officials at Boeing, which controls about 60 percent of the worldwide market for commercial jets, compared with some 35 percent for Airbus, said they welcomed the news.
""We welcome an Airbus reorganization that would make its financial arrangements agree with generally accepted accounting principles and become transparent to public scrutiny, which includes the publication of regular financial statements,"" a Boeing spokesman said.  
He added that Boeing officials expect any reorganization would ""further remove Airbus operating decisions from government control and influence.""
Demisch believed the latest Airbus agreement would enable the consortium to better integrate aircraft development, although manufacturing would still be done by the four member companies.
The consortium members are French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz AG's aerospace unit and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.  
He said Airbus's success as a multinational should position it to compete in areas beyond its core commercial jet market such as defense and space.
While the Airbus restructuring is aimed in part at raising the billions of dollars needed to launch its planned A-3XX jumbo jet, Boeing officials have aggressively disputed the market projections put forward by the consortium.
Boeing, which is mulling a possible stretch version of the 747, says the market for a super-jumbo jet is barely big enough for one player, much less two. And Boeing says an all-new jet would cost far more than the $8 billion Airbus projects.
Meanwhile, Airbus recently postponed a decision on a far cheaper plan to stretch its A340 model to compete with the sallest 747 and largest 777 models.

31,"Federal officials Sunday confirmed 29 cases of bacterial poisoning linked to fresh apple juice as investigators tested for contamination in samples pulled from Western U.S. and Canadian store shelves.
Bob Howard of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said the agency had confirmed that 29 children and young adults had been infected with a potentially fatal strain of the E. coli bacterium after drinking Odwalla Inc. fruit juice in California, Washington, Colorado and the Vancouver area of British Columbia.
At least 36 additional cases are suspected or under investigation, state, county and provincial officials said.
State and federal officials continued to test Odwalla juice samples over the weekend but said they had not found any evidence of contamination.
""We're going to have to wait a few days to know for sure whether the samples are negative or positive,"" Arthur Whitmore of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. ""It is quite possible we won't actually find anything, but we have a good selection of samples, including those from the company's library of samples.""
Odwalla, a rapidly growing juice company based in Half Moon Bay, California, was able to provide samples from production runs of two weeks ago, when the first cases surfaced in the Seattle area.
Whitmore said he did not know of any cases in which illness set in after Oct. 23, although the disease can incubate for up to two weeks.
At least four children remained hospitalized because of complications caused by the E. coli O57:H7 bacterium, including a 2-year-old girl in critical condition in California. Tara Azizi was in critical condition ""but improving slightly,"" Stephen Texeira of Children's Hospital in Oakland said.
Young children are most susceptible to the bacterium, which causes stomach cramps followed by bloody diarrhea. In severe cases the illness can lead to kidney failure, which is treated through dialysis but may cause brain damage and death.
The bacterium, which normally lives in the digestive system of cattle, can enter the food chain through fecal contamination, because of either improper slaughtering or contact with manure.
Health officials speculated that Odwalla may have used apples that had fallen onto the ground, although company officials say they do not use ""ground apples"" and all produce is thoroughly washed before processing at the company's Dinuba, California, plant.
Odwalla juices are not pasteurized. Heat processing kills bacteria but can also alter flavor.
The outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 is the biggest in the United States since 1993 when more than 500 people fell ill in the Pacific Northwest and three children died after eating tainted meat, mostly at Jack-In-The-Box hamburger restaurants.
The same strain of E. coli sickened 9,500 people and killed 11 in Japan last summer. No source was identified in that outbreak, though raw radish shoots were suspected.
The CDC's Howard said the agency recommended that people boil unpasteurized cider or juice.
"
31,"Microsoft Corp Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said he expected earnings and revenues to rise sequentially in the fiscal third and fourth quarters compared with the just-ended second quarter.
Brown said in an interview he expects the recent release of Office 97 to provide a ""nice step"" up in earnings in the third quarter from the $0.57 a share reported for the second quarter, and he sees a ""small sequential step up"" in the fourth quarter.
Brown also said he expected revenues and earnings growth in the 20 percent range for fiscal 1998 beginning July 1, 1997.  
""It doesn't seem wise to get beyond that with data we have today,"" he said.
Brown said he was pleased with the record results of the just-ended second quarter, which he said was strong ""across the board.""
But he said the company thought it was prudent to issue a warning about slower growth in fiscal 1998, when Microsoft will not enjoy the benefit of major revenue-enhancing upgrades such as Windows 95 last year and Office 97 this year.  
While the company does have an opportunity to boost its OEM revenue with the increasing penetration of the high-end Windows NT operating system, which generates more revenue per unit than Windows 95, Brown said he expected that to be more significant in fiscal 1999.
""It's just a good time to be a little bit realistic about '98,"" he said.
Brown said he expected research and development spending to continue to grow faster than revenues in fiscal 1998, although he declined to be specific. He noted that the company's R&amp;D spending now exceeds an annual rate of $2 billion, and he expected that to exceed $3 billion ""at some point"" in the future, putting pressure on profit margins.
He said while the company has reduced its cost of goods sold this year, it is unlikely to be able to reduce them much further next year.
But he said the company could continue to reduce its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues.
Brown also said the company's cash position spiked up in the second quarter, in part because of a hedging transaction connected with its stock option program. ((-- Reuters Seattle bureau 206-386-4848))

31,"Boeing Co. is expected to use the biennial Farnborough Air Show in England next week to formally launch the long-awaited stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet, industry analysts say.
While officials of the aerospace giant remain tight-lipped, analysts say it is all but certain executives will make a major announcement on Monday regarding two new members of the 747 family that will be known as the 747-500 and 747-600.
""They're going to announce the airplanes -- there is no doubt,"" said Joe Campbell, an analyst at Lehman Bros.
He said the only question was whether Boeing would announce massive orders of $10 billion or more from launch customers or merely disclose that its board of directors had given authorization to offer the jet.
The announcement of the new models, which would include a jet with 30 percent more capacity than today's largest commercial airliner, is expected to be the highlight of the air show, frequently the stage for major order announcements and other industry news.
Boeing officials have said they are talking with at least six airlines about the potential new versions of the jumbo jet, including British Airways Plc, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.
Boeing President Phil Condit said the company's board of directors discussed the new plane at a regularly scheduled meeting Monday but had not made a decision on whether to launch it.
""That will depend on airline orders,"" he said in a brief interview Tuesday.
Specifications being circulated within the industry call for the 747-600 to hold 548 passengers in a typical three-class configuration with a range of up to 8,900 miles (14,300 km), compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles (13,500 km) for the current-generation 747-400.
The long-range 747-500 would hold 462 passengers in three classes and have a range of up to 10,000 miles (16,000 km).
Analysts say the 747 stretch is essential for Boeing to continue dominating the lucrative top end of the market -- which it has had to itself since the introduction of the four-engine jumbo jet in 1970, which nearly bankrupted the company.
Now Boeing's own new 777 twin-engine jet is replacing older 747s, and possible new versions of jets from rivals Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. could threaten the lower end of the jumbo market.
""They really do need to be able to move up to again have a position of complete monopoly for the aircraft as they have had for a number of years,"" said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
Meanwhile Airbus has signaled that it intends to go ahead with plans for its own all-new 550-seat plane, dubbed the 3XX, although analysts question whether the market for jumbo jets is big enough for two manufacturers.
""From an economic point of view, I don't think there's enough demand to justify the $10 (billion) to $15 billion cost"" of an all-new jet, said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.
He and other analysts said they expect air travel in the fast-growing Pacific region to follow the Atlantic in migrating to pairs of smaller cities rather than routes between world capitals that require the largest jets.
The trend toward such more thinly traveled routes was among the reasons cited by Boeing when it shelved a project to jointly develop with Airbus a double-decker airliner that would hold up to 800 passengers.
But Lehman's Campbell predicted Europe's Airbus, which is transforming itself from a consortium into a single company, would go ahead with its own jumbo jet for commercial delivery in 2003, about three years after Boeing's new 747 models.
""They're not going to leave Boeing alone at the upper end,"" he said.
Campbell estimated that Boeing's 747 revision, which would include a new wing, new engines and possible new cockpit electronics, would cost from $5 billion to $8 billion to develop.
Rolls-Royce Plc has said it plans to offer a variant of its Trent turbofan engine to power the new Boeing craft, while rivals General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit have formed a joint venture to develop an alternative power plant.

31,"Declaring their belief that the Internet will be the ""next mass medium,"" Microsoft Corp. executives Thursday unveiled the new version of the company's MSN online service, with a heavy emphasis on entertainment programming.
Despite bandwidth limitations and other technical obstacles that make full-motion video impractical, many of the new MSN programmes resemble daily and weekly television shows, with the service organised into six core ""channels"" aimed at specific demographic groups.
In little more than a year, MSN has become the No. 3 online service, with 1.6 million subscribers. Company executives told a news briefing they expected to double that figure by mid-1997 and take market share from leader America Online Inc., relying in large part on a $100 million marketing campaign.
But the executives, conceding that the older America Online had a deeper and broader selection of content, said they planned to compete for new online customers, especially those under 30, rather than trying to persuade existing AOL customers to switch.
They were eager to heap criticism on the existing MSN service, launched along with the Windows 95 operating system in August 1995 but almost immediately overtaken by the rapid growth of the Internet.
""MSN was probably the worst of the bunch in terms of ease of use,"" said Laura Jennings, Microsoft vice president for the online service.
But she also noted that the service had been gaining 100,000 subscribers a month despite virtually no advertising and problems, including a computer snafu that has delayed bills to most customers for three months or more.
The new ad campaign will begin almost immediately with billboards and print advertisements followed by television commercials beginning in early November, when the service officially launches.
Microsoft also announced a new pricing scheme with an offer of unlimited access for $19.95 a month, instead of 20 hours for the same price under the current service. The minimum monthly fee will rise to $6.95 for five hours, in line with rival services and up from $4.95 for three hours under the current service.
The heart of the relaunched MSN is an uncluttered browser interface dominated by a promotional ""billboard"" in the centre of the screen and the six ""channels"" at the bottom corresponding to broad categories such as news, entertainment, education and children.
Clicking on the channels leads into programming developed by Microsoft and its partners that ranges from the MSNBC news service to new interactive serial programmes. Among the programmes demonstrated were quiz shows, a humorous daily news audiocast and magazine-type presentations such as ""Underwire,"" produced by and for women.
The service also includes electronic mail, ""chat"" and a more traditional menu of online categories that leads users to areas within MSN or out on the Internet.
Most content in the service will be restricted to subscribers using the company's Windows 95 computer operating system and Internet Explorer browser, and executives would not say whether they have plans to produce a version for the older Windows 3.1 system still used by tens of millions of computer owners.
Some features of MSN, including MSNBC news, electronic shopping and the planned Expedia consumer travel service, will be available at no cost to anyone with access to the Internet.
Patty Stonesifer, Microsoft senior vice president for interactive media, said the company's broad involvement in online consumer services was driven by ""our belief that the Internet is the next mass medium.
""We need to provide compelling reasons to go online and stay online,"" she said. ""There aren't enough compelling reasons to do that today.""
By some estimates, only 10 million of the nation's 99 million households are currently online, though others say even that figure is high.

Demand for space has eased slightly as a recent backlog is cleared and some airlines provide extra capacity, but key ex-Hong Kong rates have continued to rise, Reuters research shows.
Airlines and freight forwarders report brisk business as the territory's traditional peak season gathers pace and high demand for space has allowed airlines on European routes to again raise rates for the second time within three weeks.
A rise of 50 HK cents a kg on October 16 follows a HK$2 a kg rise imposed on October 1 on key routes to Europe. Transpacific demand is also said to be especially strong allowing rates to firm slightly.
Pressure for cargo space is also being exacerbated by high demand on passenger flights which is reducing bellyhold capacity for many airlines.
Sam Chung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents and director and general manager of Fritz Air Freight (HK) Ltd, said the market was very strong especially in his company's main sector, the United States.
""Every single flight is full but space should become a little better because some airlines are putting on extra capacity. In early October there was a backlog everywhere but that is now easing,"" Chung said.
He also highlighted the HK$2 a kilo rate rise on routes to Europe from October 1 with more ""unfair rises"" due to bite.
Two U.S. airlines have drafted in extra aircraft to cope with heavy trans-Pacific demand.
Polar Air Cargo is employing two additional Boeing 747 freighters between the territory and Chicago and New York.
""At the start of October it was really busy with a lot of airlines having a backlog in Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan. But right after China's national day and the mid-Autumn festival when a lot of factories closed down it gave us the chance to move a lot of cargo out of Hong Kong and gave us the chance to clear the backlog,"" said David Sung, Polar Air's Hong Kong sales manager.
More extra capacity on the trans-Pacific route has come from Evergreen International Airlines Inc which says it now offers six Boeing 747 flights a week instead of four previously. The additional flights on Mondays are to Columbus,Ohio then onto New York and Los Angeles.
""All flights are absolutely full and if we had additional flights. into Hong Kong we would have no problem filling them because there is a lot of freight being moved and a backlog is building up,"" said Evergreen's Vice President Kersti Krepp
There is also extra capacity being drafted onto a main European route. Lufthansa Cargo AG says it will put an additional freighter on the Hong Kong to Frankfurt route before the end of the month because of high demand.
The extra flight will increase the total number of flights Lufthansa operates to Germany in a joint venture with Cathay Pacific Cargo to 11 per week. September also saw an additional freighter being drafted onto the route increasing the number of joint freighter from nine a week during July and August to 10 now.
British Airways World Cargo ,which has three freighter flights per week between Hong Kong and London Gatwick wet-leased from Atlas Air, in addition to belly cargo space on its twice daily passenger flights to Heathrow, also reports a very strong market.
""This is the peak of the year and we have been very strong and are very pleased with our performance. Every available metre of space is full and we think that will carry on for the forseeable future,"" said Chris Humphrey, British Airways s regional cargo manager Pacific who is based in Hong Kong.
He said rates to Europe have increased to reflect the strength of the market and thinks another rate rise is justified.
""Fuel prices have gone through the roof. Yields are again at the same level they were last year but underlying costs are increasing, particularly fuel,"" complained Humphrey.
Mark Wilson, Managing Director of freight forwarders Benair Freight also said pressure for space has recently eased as a backlog is cleared.
""Space is tight but available which proves that the airlines are working together and not discounting too much. Rates have stayed firm and the airlines are trying to keep rates up,"" he said.
He said rates to Europe have recently increased by around 20 per cent and by 15 per cent to the U.S. Inter-Asian rates are stable where yields are traditionally stronger.
Stanley Hui, the chief operating officer of the territory's only all cargo airline AHK Air Hong Ltd, which flies 747 freighters both east and westbound, said he had no complaints especially about the trans-pacific sector.
""Unlike in previous years, there has not been that much additional capacity employed during the peak period. Demand both in and out of Europe is also firm and services to Japan are busy. After last year's record year and a slow start to this year we have high expectations about Japan,"" Hui said
The latest statistics from Hong Kong's Civil Aviation department show Tokyo-Narita to be the biggest importer of Hong Kong goods. 8,742 tonnes of air cargo was flown from Hong Kong to the Japanese capital during August, according to the statistics.
Hui also said he expected rates to Europe to continue to rise.
""We are not trying to be greedy but we can't lose money forever and all cargo airlines are trying to recover what we have lost,"" Hui said.
Many airlines report being especially badly hit by Hong Kong's seasonal monsoon winds. Northerly winds mean aircraft have to take off in a steep climb over densely populated Kowloon and payload has to be reduced.
Air France Cargo said all carriers were being affected on both European and trans-Pacific long haul routes by having to suddenly off-load pallets and a backlog of more than 400 tonnes built up in early October.
""Everybody is being hit by these weather conditions and customers are unhappy about having their cargo left behind - but so are we. It is the first time I've ever known so much having to be offloaded,"" said Philippe Bour, the airline's regional cargo manager for Hong Kong, China, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea.
Paul Choi, assistant general manager of MSAS Cargo International in Hong Kong said the back log has now eased, partly due to more cargo being flown from Macau.
Gemini Air Cargo flew its first McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 freighter into the Portuguese enclave from New York on September 27 with about 40 tonnes of cargo mostly destined to be shipped to Hong Kong. The airport which opened last November says Gemini is the fourth all cargo service to serve Macau on a regular basis and unlike Hong Kong has no severe space and slot restrictions or curfew.
Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL), which enjoys a monopoly on cargo handling at Kai Tak airport said after a ""pretty lack lustre"" first half the market has picked up during August and September which should continue in the traditional peak period towards Christmas.
HACTL reported a 7.1 per cent increase in throughput during September over last year whnn exports and imports rose by 5.5 per cent to 68,673 tonnes and 7.3 per cent to 49,063 tonnes respectively over September last year.
HACTL managing director Anthony Charter said transshipments ""soared"" 13.7 per cent to 16,775 tonnes ""which interestingly may point to sign of a regional pick-up.""
""There seems to be a shortage of capacity which is traditional at this time of year along with the hike in rates. I think this year we are seeing a slightly more positive outloook,"" Charter said.
HACTL says it is on course for another record year and expects a rise of around four per cent which is a far cry from the 23 per cent growth in previous years but ""still welcome."" - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017

15,"All-cargo airline Polar Air Cargo is to take delivery of its first Boeing 747-200F series aircraft at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport on December 13, an airline statement said.
The handover of the aircraft fresh from a 'C' check at Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company brings the number of B747s in the Polar fleet to 14, it added.
The carrier's chief executive officier, Ned Wallace said in the statement that Polar's fleet will increase by two to three 747's each year over the next five years. The next 747-200F is scheduled for delivery in first quarter 1997, he added.
Industry observers say Polar has a reputation for being a low cost airline using first generation former passenger 747 aircraft converted to carry around 100 tons of cargo.
The U.S. based carrier said it is anticipating a ""significant jump"" in its Asian operations if the U.S. Department of Transportation finalises a ""tentative"" decision awarding Polar the new U.S.-Japan all-cargo route.
Polar said the Department of Transportation's favourable evaluation was partly due to its proposal to increase using Anchorage, Alaska as a hub to trans-load traffic between Asia, South America, Europe and the U.S.
""The final award of the Japan route will mark the culmination of a three year strategy by Polar to create an effective global network of operations. As we extend our geographic reach, we enhance our competitiveness by giving our customers the market access and route flexibility they need,"" Wallace added.

15,"Cathay Pacific chairman Peter Sutch on Monday dug the first turf for the airline's new corporate headquarters in Hong Kong.
""This headquarters... is a firm, visible and concrete example of our commitment to Hong Kong,"" Sutch told guests and reporters at the huge airport construction site.
The US$448 million or HK$3.5 billion HQ at the territory's Chek Lap Kok airport will house almost all the airline's staff under one roof for the first time. Sutch described the new building as a very important stage in Cathay's 50 year history offering a ""home from home"" for more than 4,000 employees.
The move to th will open up many new commercial, business and marketing opportunities.
Hank Townsend, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Airport Authority, the body set up to run the new airport assisted at the ceremony.
""We wish you success, luck and great prosperity in the future and welcome you as one of the family, as one of the tenants here at Chek Lap Kok,"" Townsend said.
The one million square foot complex, being built by Dragages et Travaux Publics (HK) Ltd, part of the French Bouygues Group, includes a 10 storey office block, a 23 storey staff hotel with 350 rooms and a leisure area.
Cathay hopes for savings and improvements in efficiency by not having its staff and 30 department offices spread aronnd Hong Kong. Managers hope to overcome staff concerns about commuting time to the new airport site on Lantau island.
The new airport is due to open in April 1998, and Cathay said its new HQ is due to be completed in August 1998.

15,"Major airlines operating cargo flights to Europe are to raise their ex-Hong Kong cargo rates by HK80 cents per kg from November 4 to try and offset increased jet fuel prices, airline officials told Reuters.
Stanley Hui, the chief operating officer of the territory's all-cargo airline, AHK Air Hong Kong Ltd, said an emergency meeting of airlines was held in Hong Kong this morning to discuss a fuel surcharge.
Among the airlines represented were Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, Lufthansa Cargo, Air France, Martinair and Cargolux, he said.
However British Airways World Plc -- a major carrier from Hong Kong to London was not represented, industry sources said.
""Fuel costs have escalated to such a level that it is only right and fair that the shippers share some of the cost because the impact on the airlines has been very obvious,"" Hui said.
Other carriers operating trans-Pacific routes for instance are also expected to follow suit with a similar increase, Hui added.  
Philippe Bour, regional cargo manager for Air France in Hong Kong said his airline will apply the increase from November 4 along with Lufthansa Cargo. Cargolux, Air Hong Kong and other carriers would follow a few days later, he added.
""It is a world-wide problem. Fuel prices in France rose 51 per cent from June to October, in Asia they have risen 33 per cent this year and something has to be done. We hope this will help us,"" Bour said.
Another cargo manager said, ""It is not a case of running out of patience but of running out of money.""
Japan Airlines Co Limited yesterday reported a 60.7 percent slump in profits in the six months to September due to higher fuel costs and the yen's retreat against the dollar.
JAL said fuel costs had risen by US$128 million compared with a year ago.
Other major Asian cargo airlines in the region say they are watching the situation closely.
Ming Fai Lai, cargo manager for China Airlines in Hong Kong, said it is waiting before deciding to follow suit but said an 80 cents rise would only have a limited benefit.
""If all European carriers unanimously raise their rates then we will follow but it is not clear if they will all adopt the same policy. 80 cents may help a little bit but for the future I don't think it will help that much,"" said Lai. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017

15,"DHL Worldwide Express is investigating whether to have a new Hong Kong operations centre near the territory's new airport, its Hong Kong and China area manager Andy Tseng said.
The proposed centre would be in addition to and complement the express freight centre now under construction at Chek Lap Kok in which DHL has an equity stake.
It would also be in addition to the firm's existing town centre base near Tai Tak airport and its satellite depots across the territory. DHL recently invested HK$15 million in a new automatic handling system able to process 4,000 items an hour at its existing airport base.
""It is a vital decision for our future and a huge involvement. We must make sure we make the right decision for us and for our customer's changing needs in the future. It is difficult and we are collecting as much information as possible on what our customers want,"" Tseng said.
DHL say they have been approached by four real estate developers offering green field sites or existing buildings for conversion in west Kowloon, a mainly industrial area close to the new bridge and motorway link to the new airport on Lantau island.
Other air cargo companies are also reported to be considering off-airport sites because they fear high building rents and staff relocation problems at the new airport.

15,"Landing fees at Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok airport must be competitively priced compared to other airports in the region, the chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Peter Sutch said.
Reports of fees double those at Kai Tak airport have already caused alarm among airlines and representative groups such as the Orient Airlines Association.
As one of the main users of the new airport, industry observers say Cathay managers are especially concerned about the level of the new fees which will heavily influence long term profitability.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) Users' Group is one group closely watching the situation, Sutch noted at the ceremonial start of work on Cathay's new headquarters at the site of the new airport.
""As airlines compete against each other, so do airports such as Taipei, Singapore and Bangkok's new airport. It is important for the industry and the economy of Hong Kong that the airport is competitive for its users,"" Sutch said.
A spokesman for the Airport Authority, the body set up to manage Chek Lap Kok said the consultation process is still going on and the fee structure is expected to be revealed in the first or second quarter of next year.
Sutch said Cathay is considering raising passenger ticket prices and air cargo rates because of increased fuel costs.
""We are seriously considering reducing some of the increased fuel cost through higher ticket prices and cargo rates. As soon as a decision is made we will let you know,"" he said.
Airlines belonging to IATA agreed on Friday on a three per cent rise in air fares to cover higher fuel bills. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

Speaking from the Portuguese enclave, Air Macau's cargo supervisor sales and marketing Simon Tang told Reuters the new airline is achieving 60 percent load factors on current available capacity.
Airline statistics show that Air Macau has carried 3091 tonnes of air cargo in the first nine months of cargo operations although during the first two months no cargo was carried.
The figures also show a steady increase from 161 tonnes in January to a high of 489 tonnes in August.
""For a newly established airline I am quite happy to have achieved 60 percent load factors so quickly,"" Tang said.
""Due to the new aircraft arriving next year and the new routes into China I expect cargo carrying capacity to increase by 20 to 30 percent which should be a dramatic improvement."" he added.
The Airbus A321 aircraft on seven year leases will join the airline's four other A321 and smaller A320s which are due to begin flying to three new destinations in China -- Hainan Island, Qingdao and Wuhan, the airline said.
It began flying 11 months ago when Macau International Airport opened and currently serves six destinations with 63 frequencies per week to Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
The airline said it wants to fly to 22 destinations in the next three years including Australia, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul.
Air Macau also said it expects to carry 30 percent more passengers than forecast for its first year of operation, a total of 650,000. Many use Macau as a staging post for semi-direct flights where they are not required to change planes between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.

He added that the first phase of the hub at Taipei's Chiang Kai Shek airport is due to formally open on October 10 and is on schedule to be fully operational by March next year.
Six Boeing aircraft -- two 747s, two 757s and two 767s -- are due to operate eight flights a day in and out of Taipei six days a week from March connecting the U.S. with the company's growing Asian network.
The fast package carrier confirmed this week that it had won traffic rights to operate five frequencies a week from Bangkok. Sobolewski says other cities to be linked to the Taipei hub are Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Osaka.
""The hub will enhance our service throughout Asia, make us more competitive and as this market grows we will have a reliable product and give a superior service. We have had very positive feedback from our customers especially in Taiwan,"" Sobolewski told Reuters from his Singapore office.
With the six aircraft, some brand new, the total investment in Taipei will amount US$400 million, UPS said. It added construction work on the first phase of the 4,800 square metres sorting office began this month.
The first Taiwan-based aircraft due next month will activate traffic rights awarded to UPS under the recent Japan-U.S. bilateral agreement, allowing packages to be picked up at Osaka's Kansai airport for distribution throughout Asia.

It is the first time I've ever known so much having to be offloaded,"" said Philippe Bour, the airline's regional cargo manager for Hong Kong, China, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea.
Paul Choi, assistant general manager of MSAS Cargo International in Hong Kong said the back log has now eased, partly due to more cargo being flown from Macau.
Gemini Air Cargo flew its first McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 freighter into the Portuguese enclave from New York on September 27 with about 40 tonnes of cargo mostly destined to be shipped to Hong Kong. The airport which opened last November says Gemini is the fourth all cargo service to serve Macau on a regular basis and unlike Hong Kong has no severe space and slot restrictions or curfew.
Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL), which enjoys a monopoly on cargo handling at Kai Tak airport said after a ""pretty lack lustre"" first half the market has picked up during August and September which should continue in the traditional peak period towards Christmas.
HACTL reported a 7.1 per cent increase in throughput during September over last year whnn exports and imports rose by 5.5 per cent to 68,673 tonnes and 7.3 per cent to 49,063 tonnes respectively over September last year.
HACTL managing director Anthony Charter said transshipments ""soared"" 13.7 per cent to 16,775 tonnes ""which interestingly may point to sign of a regional pick-up.""
""There seems to be a shortage of capacity which is traditional at this time of year along with the hike in rates. I think this year we are seeing a slightly more positive outloook,"" Charter said.
HACTL says it is on course for another record year and expects a rise of around four per cent which is a far cry from the 23 per cent growth in previous years but ""still welcome."" --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017

45,"The United States envoy in Hong Kong reminded China on Tuesday of its pledge to preserve Hong Kong's ""vital"" freedoms after Britain hands the colony over to China next year and said Washington would be watching.
Richard Boucher, the U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong, stopped short of saying what his government could do for the territory if China reneged on its promises after it resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
""As Hong Kong heads towards the transition, the handover has been assuming higher visibility as a factor in U.S. foreign policy... It is one of the key events in Sino-U.S. relations over the next few years,"" Boucher said.
""We have our voice, interest and participation in China and Hong Kong. It is not a threat...but we want to first see what happens,"" he said in a speech to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong.
The freewheeling British colony of over a century and a half is promised far-reaching autonomy for 50 years under a Sino-British treaty and related documents.
Quoting the ancient Chinese sage Confucius, Boucher said a measure of whether Hong Kong was well ruled after 1997 would be if ""its subjects are content and foreigners are attracted"".
He reminded Beijing of its promises made about Hong Kong -- the survival of freedom of speech, press, assembly, movement, travel, religion, among others. ""That is a sweeping, vital and unrestricted pledge,"" he said.
With only 203 days left under the British flag, Hong Kong people are nervous over the future of these freedoms and about China's plan to replace their elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature, to be chosen this month, overseen by Beijing.
Boucher, echoing criticisms made previously by other senior U.S. diplomats, described the provisional body as ""unnecessary and unjustified"".
""It is important for Hong Kong to have a legislature that is constitutionally elected.""
Boucher refrained from commenting on whether Hong Kong Chinese residents holding U.S. passports would enjoy U.S. consular protection after the handover.
""We do in every case offer consular protection when we can but the question of dual nationality is very complicated...and I can't give details now,"" he said. Some 37,200 U.S. citizens live in Hong Kong, many of them dual nationals.
Boucher also said China had signalled to Washington that U.S. Navy ships could continue to make recreational port visits to Hong Kong after 1997, although details had to be worked out.
About 70 U.S. warships call in at Hong Kong each year.

45,"One of Hong Kong's best-known pro-democracy politicians, Emily Lau, was dragged away kicking and screaming by police after lying down on a road to protest against China's methods of choosing a post-colonial leader.
Up to 40 pro-democracy activists scuffled with riot police outside the Hong Kong Convention Centre, where a committee of 400 chosen by Beijing voted for a chief executive to rule Hong Kong after Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight next June 30.
Police said 29 demonstrators were arrested for obstruction and would be released on bail later in the day.
A dozen activists shouting ""oppose the phoney election"" lay down on the road and were dragged away by police.
Lau, an independent democrat fiercely critical of China's communist rulers, was among those carried off, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear whether Lau was among those arrested.
Fellow legislators Andrew Cheng of the Democratic Party and trade union leader Lee Cheuk-yan were also hauled away.
""It's a sad day for Hong Kong. What can ordinary Hong Kong citizens do -- they cannot vote,"" John Wing-ling Tse, a legislator of the Democratic Party, said.
Earlier, protesters erected a ""tomb of democracy"" outside the building and condemned the voting as the end of freedom and the rule of law in the territory.
A panel of 400 chosen by China voted for the future leader. None of the rest of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people had a vote, causing the democracy lobby to dismiss the process as a sham.
Several hundred pro-democracy activists demonstrated on Tuesday evening and 20 diehards camped out overnight with an imitation tomb in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
The first thing in the line of sight when Selection Committee members arrived was the imitation ancient Chinese-style grey arched tomb, constructed from wood.
The structure faced the Hong Kong Convention Centre with the inscription ""Tomb Of Hong Kong Democracy And Rule Of Law"". Candles flickered in the wind beside it.
The committee was convened to carry out the first of two historic tasks -- to elect the man who will step into the shoes of Governor Chris Patten when Britain pulls out. The clear favourite, shipping magnate Tung Chee-Hwa, emerged victorious.
The committee's second task, on December 21, is to choose a provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legco (Legislative Council) on July 1.
The scuffles erupted after police urged the demonstrators, from the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, to move to a cordoned-off area.
Occasionally the group marched a short distance bearing the tomb aloft, as in a funeral procession. In front of the tomb a banner was posted saying ""Death of Hong Kong Rule Of Law"".
""We are against the Selection Committee's so-called election of the first chief executive,"" said Cheng. ""The selection is not real because it is done by Beijing,"" the legislator said.
The protesters brandished a colourful banner with the slogan ""Oppose the False Election Of The Chief Executive, Oppose The Provisional Legislature"" and denounced China for not allowing Hong Kong's electorate to vote.
"
45,"Thousands of Hong Kong people took to the streets under rain-filled skies on Sunday to celebrate the 100-day countdown to the resumption of Chinese rule over the British colony at midnight on June 30.
The bad weather failed to dampen an outburst of nationalistic pride as dragons, lions and unicorns -- Chinese symbols of luck and joy -- pranced to the deafening clash of cymbals and drums.
More than 7,000 people of all ages from more than 100 pro-Beijing community organisations took part in the parade which wound through busy streets on Hong Kong island.
When Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, returns to China, it will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) governed by its own Chief Executive and promised considerable autonomy in running its affairs.
""This is a grand and great occasion. In just 100 days, we will return to the Chinese motherland,"" said chief organiser Raymond Wu at the start of the rally which gathered in Victoria Park -- named after the British queen who reigned when Britain seized Hong Kong from a weak China in the 19th century.
""We welcome the washing away of over a century of humiliation and shame,"" Wu said to a burst of applause.
The present Queen's head is disappearing from the territory's coins and stamps. Victoria Park will be renamed Central Park after the handover.
Few of the merry-makers as much as glanced at the massive bronze statute of Victoria in the park as they left for a march through the streets.
Sporting red and white baseball caps and waving little red and gold flags of China interspersed with the red and white flags of the new Hong Kong SAR, the crowds marched through busy streets, laughing and urging bystanders to join in. Few did.
Not everyone was as joyful as those in the parade.
A handful of demonstrators, their mouths taped shut, took up position around the base of Victoria's statue and held up placards condemning China's military crackdown on student-led demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June, 1989.
""People are bleeding, butchers are celebrating, shame on you,"" the black and white placards read.
But they failed to get much attention.
""They are mad. This is a glorious occasion. The past has been a shame for Hong Kong. I cannot wait for the handover,"" a bystander, Wu, 65, told Reuters.
"
45,"The sentencing of Chinese dissident Wang Dan to 11 years in prison in Beijing on Wednesday sparked fears in Hong Kong about curbs on freedoms when the territory reverts to China next year.
Hong Kong activists denounced the verdict, and a human rights group vowed to lobby for a resolution to be passed at the United Nations condemning China's human rights record.
A Beijing court on Wednesday found the 27-year-old former student leader Wang guilty of the capital offence of conspiring to subvert the government.
Wang, who faced a potential maximum penalty of death for the charge, was also stripped of political rights for two years, a typical Chinese punishment for critics of communist rule.
The verdict, at a trial lasting less than four hours, raised an outcry in the British colony, which returns to Chinese rule in 244 days.
""We worry that the Chinese government (would) apply a similar standard in Hong Kong,"" legislator Bruce Liu of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood said.
""Then the freedom of Hong Kong will be limited and (people) will be charged if we openly criticise the Chinese government.""
Pro-democracy activists who staged an overnight vigil in front of Beijing's de facto embassy in Hong Kong shouted slogans when they heard the news about Wang on the radio.
Robin Munro, director of the Hong Kong office of Human Rights Watch Asia, said the trial was extraordinarily short for what was deemed the most serious offence in China's criminal law.
""By any legal standards, today's trial of Wang Dan was a farce. Clearly, its sole purpose was to put Wang Dan behind bars for as long as possible with the minimum legal fuss and bother,"" Munro told Reuters.
""What more evidence does the international community now need before it will wake up to the fact that (Beijing) is not advancing towards a more liberal regime...but is becoming less tolerant of peaceful political opposition and absolutely determined to silence critics by any means possible?"" he said.
While Hong Kong has been promised a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years under a Sino-British handover treaty, many doubt whether the freedoms now enjoyed will be preserved.
Munro said his organisation would lobby the United States and Europe to pass a resolution at the United Nations condemning the human rights situation in China.
Hong Kong activists also planned a demonstration in front of China's mission on Wednesday night, and another on Sunday.
"
45,"Hong Kong lined up on Thursday to pay its respects to China's dead leader Deng Xiaoping.
Colonial Governor Chris Patten was one of the first to be escorted inside the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's de facto mission in Hong Kong, to offer his condolences. Deng died late on Wednesday at the age of 92.
""I have written to director Zhou Nan, the head of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), expressing my condolences and of course if there is a condolence book opened I will want to sign that with the senior members of my administration,"" Patten told reporters before going in.
Asked if he would sent flowers, he replied: ""I don't think that would be appropriate.""
There has been little love lost between Government House and Xinhua during Patten's four-and-a-half-year tenure as the 28th and last British Governor of Hong Kong.
China denounced Patten as a political prostitute, a criminal for one thousand years and worse for spearheading democratic reforms in the twilight of British rule.
China plans to undo his reforms by dissolving Hong Kong's elected legislature and replacing it with an interim appointed chamber.
Patten was followed on Thursday by the man who will step into his shoes when the colony is handed over to China at the stroke of midnight on June 30, now just 131 days away.
Future leader Tung Chee-hwa, flanked by members of his inner cabinet, bowed three times to a large black and white photograph of Deng.
Hong Kong's politically powerful billionaires and new generation of pro-Beijing politicians turned up in force and were reverently ushered in.
An elderly couple, however, jumped the gun.
They turned up early in the morning, before Xinhua had managed to make arrangements for mourners for the man whose reforms transformed China from a weak, impoverished nation to an emerging economic powerhouse.
They were told to come back in the afternoon.
Five demonstrators staged a brief protest against Deng who they described as ""the Butcher of Beijing"" for his role in the brutal crushing of the student-led pro-democracy movement centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
""One man has just died, but so many are mourning for him. Don't forget the number of people who died on June 4,"" they said.
"
45,"Hong Kong's colonial Governor Chris Patten on Monday refused a request by future leader Tung Chee-hwa to support the interim legislature China will install in the territory when the British depart next year.
Shipping magnate Tung, emerging from his first meeting with Patten since being chosen on December 11 by a China-controlled committee to head Hong Kong from next July 1, told reporters that Patten flatly refused to provide any help to the new legislature in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty to China.
""I brought up the work of the provisional legislature. I hope Mr Patten and the Hong Kong government can give help,"" Tung told reporters outside Government House, Patten's residence.
""But Mr Patten's position was very clear. I didn't successfully convince him,"" Tung said.
Both men emerged from a 1-1/2 hour meeting to exchange hearty handshakes and make brief speeches to the press, but mentioned little else of what transpired behind closed doors.
Describing the discussion as ""long and constructive"", both said they agreed to meet in the future when the need arose.
Patten, looking serious next to Tung, managed the occasional smile for photographers but turned to lead Tung into a waiting car immediately after his successor completed his short speech.
Neither of them took questions.
Monday's meeting was conducted under a cloud of strained Sino-British relations after China snubbed British objections and went ahead last Saturday with naming the provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legislative Council (Legco) when Hong Kong returns to Chinese control 190 days from now.
The interim assembly was designed by China to reverse electoral reforms that Patten introduced unilaterally in recent years.
The move came under an international spotlight after British Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind on Friday challenged China to let the World Court rule on the legality of the new assembly.
Patten also lashed out at the new lawmaking body on Saturday, calling its appointment by a 400-member Selection Committee ""a bizarre farce"" and a ""stomach-churning"" process.
""What it shows about China is that, here it is taking over responsibility for a First World economy but they're trying to foist on us political institutions which a Third World country would reject,"" Patten had said.
""Here we are having foisted on us institutions which, frankly, you wouldn't try to run a tennis club with,"" he said.
China, however, has warned Britain against creating problems and to keep out of Hong Kong's affairs after the handover.
""After 1997, Hong Kong will be an internal affair of China. No foreign countries can interfere with China's internal affair,"" China's envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, told reporters.
""Whether Britain wants to accept my advice is up to it. But if it wants to create more new trouble, I don't think it will be out of the ordinary,"" he said on Monday at a public function.
The controversial new body is dominated by pro-Beijing figures, including 33 incumbent lawmakers and many politicians who lost to pro-democracy candidates in the 1995 Legco election.
The Democratic Party, the biggest single winner in last year's election with 19 of the 60 Legco seats, boycotted the creation of the provisional body, branding it undemocratic.
The Provisional Legislative Council, as it will be known, is to sit from July 1 until a new legislature can be created via elections.
"
45,"Hong Kong's pro-Taiwan community flew Nationalist Chinese flags across the territory on Thursday to mark Taiwan's national day for what could be the last time before China takes over in mid-1997.
As champagne glasses clinked amidst the laughter of hundreds of guests, Taiwanese hosts and well-known artistes flown in for the grand event in the posh Regent Hotel fronting the Victoria Harbour, many wondered if they would be able to celebrate in the same style next year.
""We don't know about next year, we have to see how the future Hong Kong government decides,"" Zheng An Guo, general manager of the Chong Hua Travel Agency, Taipei's de facto mission in Hong Kong, told reporters.
Hong Kong, a British colony for over a century and a half, reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. Under its Basic Law, a mini-constitution which takes effect from the handover, is a clause that Hong Kong must observe the ""one-China"" principle.
Communist China regards Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalist government fled to the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has long sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.
""I'm not sure what the future is for the celebration of the Double-ten event next year but we really want to continue if we can, even (if it is) within some other format,"" said Zhang Su Hui, a Chong Hua spokeswoman.
She added the form of the event next year and the fate of future Hong Kong-Taiwan relations would have to be sorted out through high-level cross-straits negotiations.
Pro-Taiwan sources believe the post-handover authority is likely to prevent flashy celebrations of the event -- known as ""Double-ten"" because it falls on the 10th day of the 10th month -- and to bar public display of Taiwanese flags and gatherings.
While the continued existence of the de facto Taiwanese mission is less in doubt -- so long as it abides by rules -- the raising of the Taiwanese flag, representing clear skies, white sun and the earth flushed with redness of the warrior's blood, would probably not be allowed.
""This is very clear, and the principle is very clear... after 1997, Hong Kong must abide by the 'one China' principle as laid down in the Basic Law,"" said a spokesman with Xinhua, Beijing's de facto embassy in Hong Kong.
Asked if raising of the Taiwan flag after the handover would contravene the Basic Law, he said, ""It should be. After 97, this matter according to the Basic Law would be enforced by the Hong Kong government, the central (Beijing) government would not interfere in this matter.""
"
45,"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa said on Monday the Beijing-approved body set up to replace the existing elected legislature in mid-1997 would soon hold its first sitting -- not in Hong Kong, but in China.
Tung was speaking after his first informal meeting with the post-colonial deputies who will take up lawmaking in Hong Kong after Britain hands back the territory at midnight next June 30.
The new chamber will soon hold its first official session most likely across the border in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, Tung told reporters.
""The provisional legislature must meet for the first time. It'll probably be in Shenzhen. It would be very soon,"" he said.
""We also discussed very unofficially the tasks ahead for the provisional legislature,"" Tung said.
The 60-member chamber was selected this month by a 400-strong selection committee comprised of Hong Kong people vetted by China.
The same panel earlier chose Tung to run the territory after colonial Governor Chris Patten departs in 183 days' time.
The provisional legislature is stiffly opposed by Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which emerged from 1995 elections for the present Legislative Council with the most votes of any party but will lose its seats next July 1.
The party calls the provisional body a travesty of democracy that will be illegal if it functions before the change of flag. Their threats of legal action have forced the body to meet in China.
The colonial government has agreed to cooperate with Tung on issues regarding the transfer of sovereignty but not with the provisional legislature.
On Monday Tung who has promised to respect the neutrality of Hong Kong's 180,000 civil servants, urged them to face the reality of the provisional legislature.
""The political neutrality of the civil service is very important, we must respect that. But after 1997, the provisional legislature will work with the civil service. That's a reality.""
Many in Hong Kong are worried that stable government and the rule of law will evaporate when communist-ruled China takes back the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people.
On Saturday Tung persuaded Hong Kong's top civil servant, Chief Secretary Anson Chan, to stay in her post after the handover. But he has yet to decide the fate of other top officials.
In one of the first signs of cracks in the top echelon of officials, chief graft-buster Michael Leung, head of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, last week announced he would not serve beyond the handover.
Tung, who met Leung on Monday, said he failed to persuade Leung to change his mind. ""It is a real pity. I wish he would stay...but he explained that it was for personal reasons he was leaving,"" he said.
"
45,"China endorsed Hong Kong's Tung Chee-hwa on Thursday as the man to lead the territory after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
The 59-year-old shipping magnate proved the overwhelming choice of a Beijing-vetted panel to lead the territory after the British pull down the flag, ending more than 150 years of colonial rule.
The Preparatory Committee, the 150-strong body of prominent Hong Kong and Chinese citizens established to manage the handover, extended China's recognition of Tung's new role at a session in the southern China boomtown of Shenzhen.
The endorsement was proposed by Preparatory Committee vice-chairman Wang Hanbin. ""If you don't have any objection, then approve it by applauding,"" Wang said.
The delegates, who include some of Hong Kong wealthiest and most powerful tycoons and deal-makers, dutifully clapped in unison.
Tung, whose father fled the Chinese communist revolution in 1949, will take over the helm when the colony reverts to China in 201 days' time, at midnight on June 30.
Tung said on Thursday that China's role in bailing out his family shipping empire when it ran into trouble a decade ago would not affect his leadership.
""Gratitude is one thing. Being the chief executive is another. The chief executive has to put interests of Hong Kong people before anything else,"" Tung said in an interview with Cable Television.
Hong Kong newspapers, many of which had prepared celebratory issues ahead of Wednesday's poll in which Tung eclipsed his two rivals by taking 80 percent of votes cast, heralded him as proof that Hong Kong people could run Hong Kong.
Tung has said he will take a hard line against meddling by provincial bosses who may seek to disregard Beijing's edict that Hong Kong will be a Special Administrative Region of China with considerable autonomy in governing its own affairs.
Hong Kong's Economic Times newspaper said China was expected to rank the future chief executive equal in status to a state councillor.
This position, one level below vice-premier, would mean he outranks provincial governors and would help ensure against interference in Hong Kong affairs by regional cadres, it said.
Tung's victory was considered a foregone conclusion in Hong Kong, where he has been regarded as China's man since President Jiang Zemin singled him out for a pointed handshake in January.
The Preparatory Committee is scheduled to address during the afternoon session what promises to be its most controversial task -- setting the ground rules for a Provisional Legislature in Hong Kong to replace the existing elected chamber.
China, angered by the reforms spearheaded by British Governor Chris Patten, vowed to neutralise them by dissolving Hong Kong's legislature when it takes control.
Navigating this potential minefield could prove Tung's biggest immediate headache.
Opposition in Hong Kong to the new chamber is stiff and many people are deeply concerned about the confusion that may arise if two rival legislatures jockey for power in the final six months of British rule.

45,"China, in a bid to boost the its aerospace industry, this week put on what has been touted as the biggest and costliest airshow it has ever held.
""It has been a dream for years for China's aerospace community to host a grand international airshow,"" Liang Guangda, vice-chairman of the organising committee of Airshow China '96 said on Wednesday.
""(It) will demonstrate the great success of China's reform and opening-up and improve understanding between China and aeronautical communities around the world,"" Liang said.
The six-day airshow at Zhuhai airport in southern Guangdong province, which started on Tuesday, is estimated to have cost China 350 million yuan ($42 million), organisers said.
The show brought together 300 domestic and foreign aircraft and parts producers, including heavyweights like Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas.
Held over a 53,000 square metre site overlooking the South China Sea, China put on show its premier jet fighter the China F-8II, and the Russian SU-27 fighter jet, of which China is known to have sizeable numbers.
And standing prominently in the large open grounds was China's space rocket, the Long March Number 2.
The event has been a venue for local and foreign aviation companies to sign joint venture agreements.
Collins Avionics &amp; Communications Division, a unit of Rockwell International Corp said on Wednesday that it signed a deal with two Chinese parties Shanghai Avionics Corp and Shanghai Broadcast Equipment Factory to develop a tracking system, normally used in aircraft, for ships and cars.
They would form a new joint venture company Shanghai Rockwell Collins Navigation and Communications Equipment Co Ltd in Pudong, Shanghai, to develop the product.
The device, called a global positioning system (GPS), can be used to track location, read tide changes and fuel consumption.
China, eager to make the airshow a biennial event, has left little to chance. Work started in May this year, beginning with building of two large exhibition halls and thousands have been recruited to put together the show, organisers said. (US$1 = 8.33 yuan)

30,"Australian life office National Mutual Holdings Ltd is tipped to make a strong, historic debut on the Australian and New Zealand bourses on Tuesday after its institutional offer closed six times oversubscribed last week.
The final price of A$1.60 per share was higher than the indicative bidding range initially set for institutions, and gives Australia's second biggest life office a market capitalisation of A$2.7 billion (US$2 billion) on listing.
""It was very significantly over-subscribed and at A$1.60 there's no doubt that we could have sold it a number of times over,"" National Mutual managing director Geoff Tomlinson told Reuters in an interview on Monday.
National Mutual is Australia's first listed life office and, at A$1.60 per share, will rank among the market's top 30 firms.
The shares could climb steeply on both the Australian and New Zealand exchanges on Tuesday, as institutional bidders which failed to secure enough shares in the offer step into the market to lift their stakes, share analysts told Reuters on Monday.
Institutions received on average only about 15 percent of the allotments sought, a market source told Reuters.
""There's certainly keen demand...,"" Morgan Stockbroking's director of equities, Bill Chatterton, said. The shares could reach a high of A$1.80, he added.
National Mutual's listing completes its 21-month transition from a mutual company owned by its policy-holders to a listed group free to pursue its strategic focus on Asia, unshackled by a mutual requirement to act solely in policy-holders' interests.
National Mutual will be owned 51 percent on listing by its French parent, the insurance and financial services giant Axa SA, which is prevented under the terms of the float from selling down its stake for six months after the listing.
Axa, which effectively bought into National Mutual last year at around A$1.25 per share, is sitting on an enormous paper profit. It cannot increase its stake in National Mutual unless given the Australian government's go-ahead.
Under the float, National Mutual's 1.2 million policy holders were offered either shares or a cash alternative. Shares not taken up were offered to retail investors and institutions.
Retail investors were offered the shares at A$1.50 each last month, before the final price was set at the close of institutional bidding last Friday, giving mums and dads a strong temptation to take a quick profit on Tuesday, analysts said.
""There's going to be a fair amount of underlying demand from institutions to get the stock, but there may be a little bit of stag profit-taking as well,"" a Melbourne-based analyst said.
National Mutual's Tomlinson said the listing, demutualisation and last year's capital injection of A$1.1 billion by Axa marked the end of a tough four years, especially for life subsidiary National Mutual Life.
""Tomorrow will mark the end of a four-year diffcult period and put us into a new area where we can...finalise the turnaround of National Mutual Life in Australia and New Zealand and try to take further advantage of our opportunities in Asia,"" he said.

30,"Australian resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co (BHP) posted a 9.8-percent fall in first-half profits on Friday, further disappointing the share market after a difficult year.
BHP, whose shares have been hammered since its key markets in steel and copper turned sour six months ago, posted a A$790 million (US$628 million) net profit for the six months to November 30, down from A$867 for the same period last year.
But Australia's largest quoted company had its bottom line boosted by an abnormal gain of A$107 million and investors were not impressed.
The share price climbed 54 cents to a high of A$17.59 just after the result but took a tumble and settled at around A$17.20, still 15 cents higher than Thursday's close.
""It's pretty lousy,"" one fund manager's stock analyst told Reuters.
Though forecast signs of improvement emerged in BHP's battered copper division, with the North American copper operations swinging back into profit, analysts had been tipping a first-half group pre-abnormal result of around A$760 million.
BHP's pre-abnormal net profit of A$683 million was 15.8 percent down on the corresponding 1995/96 period.
But managing director John Prescott said the second quarter figures showed an accelerating improvement in performance.
""We are seeing an improvement in our operations quarter on quarter on quarter and the trend to improvement is accelerating,"" he said in a taped interview released to the media after the result.
""I think we are moving ahead. We have a lot of work to do and we're going to build the company around its high-quality assets and we are starting to see the results of our work.""
Including abnormals, BHP's minerals, copper and steel divisions all contributed increased earnings in the latest three months compared with the August quarter. The steel division was flat.
Petroleum was the biggest earner with A$253 million for the quarter, but this included an abnormal gain of A$107 million from the settlement of a dispute over a gas resource tax.
BHP Petroleum's pre-abormal result also included a A$82 million windfall from asset sales and a larger than expected exploration expense.
""The initial reaction (to the result) was positive but this has been followed by disappointment,"" said Phillip Toop, a dealer at Brisbane broker Lance Jones.
BHP's minerals division, a major world producer of iron ore and coal, doubled its contribution to profit in the second quarter to A$154 million, due largely to higher world prices.
BHP Copper benefitted from a recent firming in the copper price and a cut of seven U.S. cents per pound in its North American operating costs to post a second quarter profit of A$132 million, up from A$85 million in the first quarter.
The U.S. copper operations, acquired last January with the US$2.4 billion purchase of Magma Copper, made a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter. Prescott said on Friday Magma had swung back into profit in the second quarter.
BHP Steel's second-quarter profit was flat at A$90 million.

30,"Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd. said Monday it was thirsty for expansion and eyeing possible joint ventures in India and Vietnam to add to its brewery holdings around the world.
Foster's executives said at the group's annual meeting in Melbourne that despite hiccups at its Canadian and Chinese operations, the company was well positioned to seize on growth opportunities both overseas and at home.
""The first priority after satisfying the cash needs of the current businesses is to seek out new direct investment opportunities with the right return profile,"" Chief Executive Officer Ted Kunkel told shareholders.
""Should that not fully utilize the available financial resources, then we would look at additional options,"" he said.
Foster's Chairman John Ralph said the group was considering joint venture breweries in Vietnam and India but said it was looking at a wide range of possible investments, including acquisitions. Asia was a major focus, he added.
He declined to give details but said the Vietnamese opportunity involved an existing plant.
""There's nothing immediate but we are looking across all the areas of our business in fact,"" Ralph told reporters.
""We are involved in looking at a couple of opportunities, but it's early days. Provided we can see it makes sense for us, and we can do it on a basis that's going to earn a satisfactory return, then we are likely to move,"" he said.
Foster's, which has breweries in Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong in China, said the Chinese operations would break even or turn a profit in the fiscal year ending in 1999. Foster's China posted a loss of A$17 million (US$13 million) before interest and tax in the latest year.
The group's 40-percent owned Canadian brewer, Molson Breweries, also performed poorly in its fiscal year that ended on April 1, but has undergone a major restructuring and is focusing on building market share at home, Foster's said.
Kunkel said Molson still delivered a high return on invested capital and forecast higher operating profits from the group's powerhouse Australian brewing unit, Carlton and United Breweries, over the medium term.
Foster's is also counting on higher returns from its British pub chain, the Inntrepreneur Pub Company Ltd., putting the group in a stong position to pursue growth, Kunkel said.
Kunkel identified Asia as the most attractive region for investment, noting beer volumes there surged 60 percent in the first half of the 1990s and were forecast to rise another 40 percent before the turn of the century.
""Access can be achieved at a sufficiently low cost and the return profile is sufficiently better therefore than in other growing markets such as South America,"" he said.
Foster's has allocated A$200 million ($153 million) for direct investments in Asian markets, deeming this ""prudent exposure.""
The group has spent four years shedding unwanted assets, lightening the burden of debt accumulated in the 1980s when it was part of the sprawling conglomerate known as Elders-IXL Ltd.

30,"Resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd is expected to report a fall in half year net profit on Friday, but share analysts say Australia's biggest company is likely to be spared another stock market mauling.
BHP, still licking its wounds with sellers having wiped around A$5 billion off its market value since May, is tipped to post a first-half net profit of around A$760 million, down from A$811 million a year ago, according to analysts' forecasts.  
The result, for the six months to November 30, is expected to include roughly A$100 million in net proceeds from asset sales, but slight improvements in the battered copper and steel divisions are also likely to emerge, the analysts said.
BHP's share price, which hit a year high of A$20.05 in early May, has been on a mostly downward roller-coaster ride for the past six months as copper and steel prices turned sour, and analysts revised down their near-term profit forecasts.  
But the copper price has firmed in recent months, steel markets are thought to have bottomed, and brokerages are again reworking their outlooks. BHP shares have also rebounded, closing on Monday at A$17.31 after hitting A$15.58 in September.
""It's one of the few companies where analysts are revising the results upwards,"" said a fund manager's share analyst.
The five analysts contacted by Reuters on Monday gave widely varying forecasts for interim profit, ranging from A$715 million to a high of A$804 million. The analyst tipping A$715 million said he believed others had forecast even lower numbers.  
But the analysts agreed the interim result would show signs of improved performance in copper and steel, though they would fine tune their estimates after seeing the group's November production data, expected to be released on Tuesday.
""They have definitely had a good two quarters in petroleum and I guess they're struggling in minerals and copper and steel,"" a Melbourne-based analyst said.
""They are doing a good job given the environment.""
Most analysts said they expected a modest profit recovery for full year 1996/97. BHP reported a 20 percent drop in pre-abnormal net profit of A$1.29 billion in 1995/96.  
BHP Petroleum, which in the first half of 1995/96 ranked behind the minerals and steel divisions in terms of profit, will be BHP's biggest earner in the interim result to be released on Friday, said JB Were and Son analyst Neil Goodwill.
""The asset sales are in there though,"" he said.
The analysts expect BHP to book between A$80 million and A$117 million in asset sales as operating profit, due in effect to gains on the sale of BHP's stake in the Mungo/Monan oil and gas fields in the North Sea and of its interest in the Sierra Chata gas field and Chihuidos block in Argentina.  
BHP also made a A$45 million profit from the sale of its 20 percent stake in an undeveloped gold prospect, Sun Prospecting and Mining Co Ltd, in South Africa. But this was offset by the A$45 million loss booked on the sale of its Mali gold assets.
BHP will not book any of these asset sales as abnormal items, deeming them too small to be taken below the line, one analyst said. But another analyst confessed he initially felt they were being taken above the line to mask the core result.  
""I thought that was the case and then the oil price shot up and copper is a bit better, so without that number (for asset sales) they would have had a reasonably good profit number anyway,"" he said.
BHP's Magma Copper operation should creep back into profit in the second quarter after posting a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter results, he said.
BHP bought Magma last January for US$2.4 billion, making it the world's second biggest copper producer. But the price tag has come under heavy criticism.  
BHP is expected to book a net abnormal gain of around A$100 million from the settlement of its dispute with the Victoria state government over a federal tax on Bass Strait gas revenues.

30,"Australian retailers are heading for a grim round of sharply lower profit results as one by one the major chains announce they have fallen casualty to a sluggish economy and tight-fisted consumers.
Homeware retailer Harvey Norman Ltd added its voice on Wednesday to the chorus of woe, revealing it was trailing its goal of 15 percent annual sales growth amid the worst retail environment in the company's 15-year history.  
The comments, made to Reuters in an interview, follow formal warnings to the stock exchange that big upmarket department store chain David Jones Ltd, and two large clothing retailers, expect steep profit slides.
David Jones and fashion houses Country Road Ltd and Just Jeans Ltd have all warned of 50 percent drops in interim profit for the half-year ending January, confirming that Christmas failed to boost retailers' bottom lines.  
""We are used to posting massive increases (in sales turnover) year after year after year. This is the first year we've ever been caught up in a general market malaise,"" said Harvey Norman managing director Michael Harvey.
""It's basically an indication to us that the market is having its worst year since Harvey Norman began (in 1982).""
Harvey Norman, which is aiming for turnover of A$1.2 billion in the year ending June 30, has enjoyed annual sales growth of up to 58 percent over the past four years.  
It, along with other retailers, had been hoping for a strong December but found Australian wallets were not as easy to prise open as they once were, especially for clothes.
Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, which accounts for almost 18 cents in every retail dollar spent, declined on Wednesday to give figures for December sales.
But corporate affairs director Peter Morgan said he was ""comfortable"" with Coles' performance. Coles has recently been among the most poorly performed listed retailers and is embarking on a major refocusing of its sprawling businesses.  
Official data released on Tuesday showed that all areas of retailing except for food weakened in the three months to November and that overall retail sales continued to trend down despite two interest rate cuts since July.
The Reserve Bank eased rates again last month, but it was too late to rescue a second dismal Christmas for retailers.
""A shocker"" was how one stock analyst summed up the festive season for the clothing retailers, but she said supermarket chain Woolworths Ltd and other food retailers should have come through the Christmas period relatively unscathed.  
Asked about the outlook for full-year profits in 1996/97, the analyst said: ""Pretty grim."" But she and another analyst said they saw a pick-up in earnings in coming months.
""I think the outlook is reasonable, but not spectacular,"" the second analyst said.

30,"Australian casino company Crown Ltd said on Tuesday its earnings were likely to suffer due to lost time at its new casino complex in Melbourne.
Crown, which has seen its share price fall as doubts emerge over its profit outlook, confirmed that a recent heatwave forced workers at the site to down tools for a number of days.
""I don't think we have made a calculation yet on what effect it will have on the bottom line, but it's something you don't need in this part of the project,"" Crown spokesman Gary O'Neill said. ""I think it will (impact profit),"" he added.  
Crown had planned to open its new A$1.6 billion casino, hotel and shopping complex in Melbourne in March. It is now aiming for late April and maybe even May, O'Neill told Reuters.
""We are still hoping to open towards the end of April...but things like this don't help obviously and it could have a small effect on the bottom line. It could put the open date back to May,"" he said.
O'Neill was commenting on a newspaper report which said members of the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) stopped work 10 times this month as the temperature topped 35 degrees Celcius.  
""There were 10 days when the temperature was over 35 degrees, but I don't think we lost all of that time,"" O'Neill said. ""I think we lost a number of working days.""
Crown also rejected a bearish earnings forecast made by accountants Ernst and Young.
The forecast was cited in an  independent report sent to Crown shareholders recently.
It quotes Ernst and Young as forecasting basic earnings per share of 3.76 cents in 1997/98 (July-June), compared with brokers' average forecast of 14.8 cents for the same year.  
The brokers' forecast was based on a mean pre-abnormal net profit of A$87.5 million for 1997/98, according to Barceps forecasting service. Crown reported net profit after abnormals of A$58.38 million in 1995/96.
""We obviously don't agree with it (the Ernst and Young forecast),"" O'Neill said.
""Right at the moment, it's a very highly speculative period of time. It's just prior to our opening and people are tending to jump at shadows a little bit,"" he added.  
Crown's share price has fallen steeply over the past month. It stood at A$2.45 at 0300 GMT (2.00 p.m.) on Tuesday, down from its closing high so far this year of A$2.76 on January 22 and its 12 month high at A$3.06.
Crown is owned 30.9 percent by Hudson Conway Ltd, the operator of Crown casino at its existing premises. Hudson Conway also has options to buy 74.5 million new shares in Crown.
Crown is currently negotiating to buy back the casino management rights from Hudson Conway.

30,"Australia's biggest company, resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP), said on Friday it has agreed to pay its domestic steel workers a 10 percent pay rise over two years.
The Australian Workers Union (AWU), which claims to represent about 80 percent of BHP Steel's 15,000 unionised steel workers, also confirmed the deal, saying it was struck and endorsed by the workforce just before Christmas.  
BHP and the AWU said the annual wage rises, effective from New Year's Day, were for five percent in calendar 1997 and five percent in 1998, paid as three percent instalments in January and two percent in July.
The wage rises include site-specific productivity offsets at steel mills around the country, but also included an adjustment for inflation and took into account other steel industry wage agreements, AWU spokesmen told Reuters.  
""These increases are to take place in the context of the agreement on the specific initiatives for improved performance through the introduction of incentive workplace agreements,"" BHP said in a short statement.
AWU negotiator Mick Eagles said the wage deal did not affect existing performance-related payments, under which workers can earn quarterly bonuses of up to about five percent of salary.
Eagles described the deal as a good outcome given the prospects for continued low inflation and predicted the wages of all Australian blue-collar workers would come under pressure.  
""I think in this environment, with the way the CPI is, I think the trend in the next 12 months and two years is going to put enormous pressure on wages to be kept low,"" he said.
""So a 10 percent outcome over two years is going to be seen as quite an achievement.""  
A BHP spokesman told Reuters the deal was satisfactory.
""Part of the agreement involves union agreement to introduce new types of employment arrangements which eliminate traditional demarcation lines and have novel concepts in terms of employment which provide us with a business benefit,"" the spokesman said.
""We think this is a satisfactory resolution, bearing in mind the benefits of those innovative agreements,"" he added.
The deal was in line with a recommendation made to the company and union last month by Australia's labour tribunal, the Industrial Relations Commission.  
BHP initially offered eight percent over two years, while the AWU entered negotiations seeking 15 percent over two years.
The agreement comes as wages growth continues to be cited by Australia's central bank as a major concern for inflation, now at historically low levels and well within the Reserve Bank's target range of between two and three percent.
The deal averted the threat of strikes at BHP's steel plants around the country, but the group's minerals division continues to feel the effects of industrial strife.  
About 700 workers downed tools on Thursday over wage and benefits disputes, halting construction of a A$1.5 billion iron ore processing plant being built for BHP at Port Hedland in Western Australia.
The striking workers are engaged to independent contractors hired by BHP.
In November, BHP coal miners in New South Wales state called a strike over cuts in accident compensation payouts.

30,"Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, reported on Wednesday a firm rise in sales revenue, signalling the worst may be over for the country's long-suffering merchants.
Coles announced a 5.4 percent rise in sales revenue to A$9.9 billion (US$7.5 billion) for the six months to January 26, sounding a rare note of optimism in an industry that has been hit hard by a downturn in consumer spending.
Coles, which pockets almost 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, attributed the result to good management rather than any pick-up in the economy.
""A lot of people have done a lot of work to get where we needed to get,"" Coles chief executive Dennis Eck told Reuters.
But Coles' announcement came a day after another retailer, David Jones Ltd, reassessed its profit outlook, painting a slighter brighter picture than the bleak dive in earnings it forecast just after Christmas.
David Jones, an upmarket department store chain, had told the Australian Stock Exchange early last month it feared a 50 percent fall in interim profit, but changed its mind this week.
""It will not be as bad as that,"" David Jones chief executive Chris Tideman told Reuters on Tuesday.
He did not elaborate but stock analysts said on Wednesday post-Christmas clearance sales helped lift the company's overall sales result to A$783 million for the first half year ending January 25 -- just one percent lower than a year ago.
""I think we have probably gone through the worst in spending, but I would not expect a dramatically big turnaround,"" said retail analyst Simon Shakesheff, of Macquarie Bank.
""The sentiment is still a bit fragile, but at the end of the day, until there's a bit more job creation out there, people are not going to be spending more,"" he told Reuters.
Another Sydney-based analyst agreed that consumers' wallets would be slow to open.
""I think we will (see a recovery) but I don't think we saw it in January,"" the analyst said.
Australian retail sales are at their lowest ebb since the nation's official statistician began counting them 35 years ago. They have fallen in trend terms in each of the past five months.
Employment has also been weak with Australia's jobless rate hovering at 8.6 percent.
Coles confirmed on Wednesday that trading conditions were still tough, especially in clothing and fashion. The group's only specialist apparel chain, Katies, reported a 4.7 percent drop in turnover in the latest sales figures.
But Coles' Eck said profit margins in its underperforming department store chains were improving, as store managers improved the quality of merchandise sold and pared back costs.
In sharp contrast to the group's 33.8 percent fall in net profit in 1995/96, Eck said he expected an increase in bottom-line earnings for the current year ending July 27.
""Our earnings are in line with our plan,"" he said.
Coles reported net profit of A$280 million in 1995/96, and stock analysts are forecasting a modest profit rise in 1996/97.

30,"Major Australian banks have blown the dust off their Asian strategies and are moving quickly into the region as life gets tough at home.
Three of Australia's biggest banks have publicly renewed their Asian ambitions in the past few months as competition hots up for the local market and earnings begin to suffer. ""It's now you are starting to see them push a bit harder into Asia,"" said Melbourne-based banking analyst Ken McLay, of credit rating agency Standard and Poor's Group.
All of Australia's four big banks are now pursuing opportunities for interest and fee income in the rapidly growing markets of Asia, quietly urged on by the nation's central bank.
Their uniform embrace of Asia comes as two of Australia's biggest life insurers, National Mutual Holdings Ltd and Colonial Mutual, also boost their Asian profiles. Last week, Colonial bought out its Asian joint venture for US$163 million.
But Asia has not always commanded such uniform priority among Australia's financial institutions.
CENTRAL BANK UNHAPPY
Only six months ago, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expressed disappointment that local banks were not seizing more opportunities to expand into Asia. At that time, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) was the only exception.
ANZ has long been Australia's most Asia-focused bank, with a retail network throughout India and operations in 40 other countries, most of them within the region.
In contrast, the most profitable bank, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), has focused in recent years on the United States and Europe. Westpac Banking Group virtually withdrew from Asia three and a half years ago to focus on home markets.
For years after the free-wheeling 1980s hit a wall of bad debts in Australia, banks had put expansion plans on hold and Asian strategies gathered dust as they repaired balance sheets.
But since late last year, talk of Asia is again on bankers' lips as interest margins contract in a tight local market where banks and non-bank institutions encroach on each other's turf. ALL EYES ON ASIA
Westpac bounced back into Asia last November, announcing an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank Plc to provide select Asian banking services to Westpac clients.
The venture will focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China, said Westpac.
NAB, which owns regional banks in the United States, Britain and Ireland, is also now looking for a partner in Asia.
""We've looked at a few (alliances) with banks and other institutions...It takes time to pull these things off,"" NAB managing director Don Argus told reporters last month.
Australia's fourth big bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd (CBA), also chimed in last week. It said it too would expand its Asian activities and was looking for joint-venture partners in Indo-China.
""Certainly the competition in the domestic market is extremely tough,"" S&amp;P's McLay told Reuters, adding he expected Australian banks' local asset quality and earnings to deteriorate.
""One of the ways to offset this is diversifaction...One way they are trying to diversify is to go offshore and I think that's a prudent strategy, but it has its risks,"" he added.
SMALL FISH, BIG POND
Australian banks, minnows compared with the regional might of banks like Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd, are likely to use geography and trade links to make their mark in Asia.
""They are small in size but the Australian banks do bring a lot of expertise. They are headquartered in the region, so they benefit from that and Australia is a major trading partner with a lot of these countries,"" McLay said.
""Australian banks are pretty well placed to piggy-back on the back of that. I think they will do quite well.""
Australia's central bank cleary hopes so, declaring that ""momentum for involvement in Asia has now clearly re-emerged"".
""The banks' focus has tended to be on the provision of trade finance and treasury services to corporates, although their retail activities in Asia are increasing,"" the RBA said in a written response to a parliamentary committee recently.
Australian banks' largest operations are in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, but they are fanning out, it said.
They are now eyeing opportunities in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma and Cambodia as these nations open up their banking sectors to foreign entrants, the RBA said.

30,"Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd said on Monday it was thirsty for expansion and eyeing possible joint ventures in India and Vietnam to add to its international stable of breweries.
Foster's executives told shareholders at the group's annual meeting in Melbourne that despite hiccups at its Canadian and Chinese operations, the company was well positioned to seize on growth opportunities both offshore and at home.
""The first priority after satisfying the cash needs of the current businesses is to seek out new direct investment opportunities with the right return profile,"" Foster's chief executive Ted Kunkel told the meeting.
""Should that not fully utilise the available financial resources, then we would look at additional options,"" he said.
Later, Foster's chairman John Ralph confirmed the group was considering joint venture breweries in Vietnam and India but said it was looking at a wide range of possible investments, including acquisitions. Asia is a major focus, he added.
He declined to give details but said the Vietnamese opportunity involved an existing plant.
""There's nothing immediate but we are looking across all the areas of our business in fact,"" Ralph told reporters.
""We are involved in looking at a couple of opportunities, but it's early days. Provided we can see it makes sense for us, and we can do it on a basis that's going to earn a satisfactory return, then we are likely to move,"" he said.
Foster's, which has breweries in Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong in China, said the Chinese operations would break even or turn a profit in 1998/99. Foster's China posted a 1995/96 loss of A$17 million (US$13 million) before interest and tax.
The group's 40-percent owned Canadian brewer, Molson Breweries, also performed weakly in its business year ending April 1, but has undergone a major restructure and is focusing on building market share at home, Foster's said.
Foster's chief executive Kunkel said Molson still delivered a high return on invested capital and forecast higher operating profits from the group's powerhouse Australian brewing unit, Carlton and United Breweries, over the medium term.
Foster's also plans to free up about A$400 million in non-performing assets and is counting on higher returns from its British pub chain, the Inntrepreneur Pub Company Ltd, putting the group in a stong position to pursue growth, Kunkel said.
Kunkel identified Asia as the most attractive region for investment, noting beer volumes there surged 60 percent in the first half of the 1990s and were forecast to rise another 40 percent before the turn of the century.
""Access can be achieved at a sufficiently low cost and the return profile is sufficiently better therefore than in other growing markets such as South America,"" he said.
Foster's has allocated A$200 million for direct investments in Asian markets, deeming this amount a ""prudent exposure"".
The group has spent four years shedding unwanted assets, lightening the burden of debt accumulated in the 1980s when it was part of the sprawling conglomerate known as Elders-IXL Ltd.
Foster's sold its British brewing unit, Courage, last year as part of this asset-sale programme. It has since bought two Australian wine-makers, Mildara Blass and Rothbury Wines Ltd.
""The restructuring of the last four years is nearly over,"" he said. ""Where there is more, it will present opportunities for profit.""
Foster's is on track to better its 1995/96 net profit of A$293.3 million in 1996/97, despite higher interest charges and tax payments in the current year, chairman Ralph said.

41,"A senior executive of Netscape Communications Corp said the company sees no sign of any reduction in the dramatic growth in the market for Internet and intranet, and expects to hold onto a good share of the market.
Mike Homer, vice president of marketing, also said in an interview the company currently has around 50 million users of its Netscape Navigator software for browsing the Internet, comprising roughly 75 percent of the total browser market.
Critical approval for its new Communicator software now being publicly previewed has topped expectations, he added.  
""We're holding market share. The market's growing very dramatically, we see no signs of that abating,"" Homer said in a telephone interview. ""We have a great new product coming, so it gives us every reason to believe that we're going to continue to do really well.""
Homer declined to comment on the company's expected results for the fourth quarter, ending December 31, or on the current quarter, citing the quiet period ahead of the earnings report that is expected to be released on January 28.
Shares of Netscape tumbled 10-7/8 earlier to close at 47-7/8 following an analyst's downgrade of the stock.  
The analyst, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's William Gurley, said in a research report he trimmed his rating to accumulate from a buy due partly to the stock's proximity to his target of $60 and partly to concern over its major product transition, and its shift to a new pricing model and a longer sales cycle.
Homer declined to talk about revenue expectations, but said that of the reviews to date for the Communicator product first shown on December 23, ""95 percent are incredibly positive.""  
""It's a better reception than any product we've ever done so far. It's going to be a smash hit product,"" he predicted.
Homer also projected the electronic mail component of the product will overtake rival e-mail products this year.
He said around 90 percent of Netscape's enterprise customers are on a yearly subscription basis.
""There's really no delaying (of revenue) based on these product cycles,"" he said. ""It may be the case that a new product will bring in new users because customers get excited about it, so there's definitely upside.""  
The Communicator is expected to undergo substantial preview testing, before being finalized in the second quarter.
""The most important indicator of our success is our new product acceptance, and Communicator has exceeded all of our best expectations, so I think that's all a good picture for the next couple of quarters,"" he added.
Homer said he expects SweetSpot server products to continue growing rapidly and repeated he sees no price pressure on the browser product despite Microsoft Corp's free distribution of its Internet Explorer browser software.
Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Parekh said the consensus revenue estimate for the fourth 1996 quarter is around $115 million, with his own estimate slightly below that at $114.5 million, rising slightly to $115.8 million in the March quarter.
""The fundamentals continue to be intact,"" he said.
Gurley warned he did not see the upside surprise in the December quarter that Netscape has shown in recent quarters.

41,"Netscape Communications Corp. President Jim Barksdale Wednesday unveiled new software that will allow users to receive personalized information anywhere on a computer network.
The new software, code-named Constellation, will also allow users to merge and customize information on computer desktops and networks, posing a fresh challenge to archrival Microsoft Corp..
In a keynote speech at the annual Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas, Barksdale described Constellation -- due for release in mid-1997 -- as part of an Internet ""third wave"" of information that can be displayed according to individual preferences.
""While the first waves of the Internet focused on users being able to easily find information, the mark of this third wave is that information finds the user,"" he said. ""Our new products will have the intelligence to help you focus on the information you care about.""
Constellation, which will be part of Netscape's next-generation Netscape Communicator corporate software, will allow users to log on or off computers throughout a network -- or even across the Internet -- and see a computer desktop with the user's personal setup.
This ""roaming"" capability, like using mobile telephones in cities outside one's home base, can free people to work in different locations using the same basic tools and calling up application software such as spreadsheets and word processors.
That provides a different approach than the one used currently by Microsoft, which requires computer makers using its Windows operating systems, for example, to show the Windows logo first.
Although Microsoft has moved aggressively over the last 11 months into the Internet market, and produces a rival browser called Internet Explorer, Netscape has so far retained the leading role in the browser market.
Microsoft, however, holds 90 percent of the market for the operating systems that run computers.
Barksdale said that with 48 million copies of Netscape's browser software sold, it is the most popular application ever, and he said recent data shows Netscape with 78 percent of all browsers.
Contrary to speculation since Netscape's red-hot stock offering in August 1995 that it would one day compete with Microsoft in operating systems, company executives said Netscape was deliberately focusing on the ability to work across some 17 different operating systems instead.
""Constellation is not an operating systems, but is a new user interface,"" Netscape Senior Vice President Mike Homer told reporters.
Although Netscape executives acknowledged there was some difficulty in making its software run on some environments, such as Windows 3.1, the company was succeeding and committed to continuing to support a variety of operating systems.
Analysts have said this is a major distinction from Microsoft, which earlier used the Comdex show to unveil a new operating system for hand-held computers, Windows CE, and its new Office 97 software package.
Although Microsoft demonstrated powerful features and Web capabilities for its new Office package, analysts said companies would only get the full benefit of it if they chose to deploy it throughout departments or the company.
The problem of distributing information to individuals in the fast-growing Internet, with its tens of millions of sites, has increasingly captured the attention of Silicon Valley's sharpest engineers.
Two start-up companies widely regarded in this area -- Marimba Inc. and PointCast Inc.'s PointCast Network -- will have their products integrated into Constellation, Netscape said.
"
41,"A few years ago, one company led the market for an exciting new technology called groupware, which enabled workers at different locations to use computers to collaborate on business projects.
But the rise of the Internet has changed all that, creating new opportunities for using such software more widely and setting the battleground for a clash for a share of one of the fastest-growing markets in the personal computer industry.
The market is driven by corporations' desire to use cheaper, easier-to-use Internet technologies to tie together far-flung and incompatible computing systems, a market some now estimate may reach $10 billion by the year 2000.
The trend has helped fuel the explosive growth of Netscape Communications Corp., which burst onto the public market in August 1995 and has been turning its focus to using Internet technologies in the lucrative corporate market for building the internal networks known as intranets.
Intranets use relatively inexpensive software to link together people across an organisation and allow access to information via a common interface, or browser.
Netscape's abrupt rise jolted software giant Microsoft Corp., which has been rushing to incorporate Internet technology throughout its products, and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp., which pioneered the groupware market with its Lotus Notes products.
At Comdex, the computer industry's largest trade show, all three companies have unveiled strategies aimed at attracting major corporate customers to their products.
Lotus, which is trying to revive its early lead with its Domino computer network software and a package of collaborative programmes like spreadsheets and word processors, promises to use IBM's deep pockets to fund its campaign.
The battle next year is expected to be even more intense than the skirmish last summer between Microsoft and Netscape over Microsoft's entry into the Web browser market, in which Netscape retains a nearly 80 percent stake.
""If they thought the browser war was bloody, just wait,"" Lotus President Jeff Papows said earlier this week. ""This will be a whole new level of bloodiness.""
Although Lotus has moved to add Internet features while slashing prices on its software for the Notes market, the roughly $700 million in research and development spending it touts is only a fraction of Microsoft's $2 billion-plus total research and development budget in fiscal 1997 alone.
And while Lotus officials privately say they would rather have the problem of reducing prices dramatically than having to build sophisticated corporate networke systems from scratch, new Internet technology offers compelling savings.
Netscape Chief Executive Jim Barksdale, in his keynote address at Comdex on Wednesday, identified some corporate customers who he said had reported up to 2063 percent return on investment by deploying intranets using Netscape products.
Microsoft Chief Executive Bill Gates said his company will focus its resources on lowering the cost of corporate computing this year with the same intensity it applied last year in adapting Internet technologies.
Analysts said that by bundling many of its Internet-based technologies with its latest operating systems, Microsoft may have an upper hand in releasing new products and with customers who are committed to remaining on the leading edge.
But even in the personal computing market where Microsoft's operating systems dominate, fewer than one-third of company machines run the latest versions of Microsoft Windows software needed to fully utilize its groupware features, they add.
""It's less a competition for (software) suite sales than it is for corporate dollars,"" said Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst Mary Meeker, who sees two paths for corporate customers.
One set may chose to upgrade all its software to the latest Microsoft products, including Microsoft's newly launched Office 97 suite.
Meeker said this option is costly.
Another set of customers, Meeker said, could chose to keep their investment in existing computers and, using Netscape's products on the 17 different systems it supports, build a system combining these machines relatively quickly.

41,"Five major high tech giants, including Compact Disk inventors Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corp. will on Wednesday unveil details of a new ""CD-ReWriteable"" (CD-RW) technology.
The technology is due to bring re-recordable CD devices to the market in the early months of 1997 at prices below $1,000, and should begin being built into top-end computers next year.
The new format will enable users to store 450 times as much data, including video and audio recordings, as a 3.5 inch floppy diskette and is designed to be compatible with new CD-ROM readers and upcoming DVD-ROM drives.
""ReWritable removes the single biggest barrier to greater market acceptance of CD writing technology,"" said Dave Deane, Future CD Writer Product Manager at Hewlett-Packard Co.'s HWP. Colorado Memory Systems division in Loveland, Co.
Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. and Ricoh Co. Ltd. are the other companies unveiling the new technology, which has been 18 months in the works.
Analysts said the CD-ROM technology could eventually pressure other storage companies like Iomega Corp. whose revenues have soared on the popularity of its 100 megabyte Zip drives and other storage products, and struggling removeable hard drive maker SyQuest Technology Inc..
""I think this would put some pressure on SyQuest type products,"" said Ray Freeman, president of Freeman Associates Inc. a Santa Barbara market research firm.
""This is a higher-capacity product, so it's not going head-to-head,"" he said, noting that Compact Disks store up to 650 megabytes of data, a larger capacity than Iomega and SyQuest offer on their lower-end consumer-oriented models.
Because the new technology standard is designed to work with common CD-ROM readers and the new DVD-ROM technology, Freeman said its introduction was ""an important step in a continuum,"" following CD-Recordable, a technology on the market since 1991 that allows once-only recording.
Freeman projects the CD-Recordable market will hit 1.3 million units this year, and the combined CD-Recordable and CD-ReWriteable market will more than double to 2.9 million units in 1997 and, combined with DVD systems, grow to 10.65 million in 2000.
Rob van Eijk, director of strategic marketing at Philips' Philips Laser Optics North America, in San Jose, Calif., said the new CD technology is aimed more at the space occupied by 100 million CD-ROMs than the floppy disk space.
The small office home office market and the high end home or small office markets are viewed as key markets for the technology as well, he added, saying the compatibility with other media made it a versatile technology.
Both Philips and Hewlett-Packard expect to offer devices in the first quarter of 1997 which would be under the $1,000 price point, but at a sizeable premium to the CD-Recordable write-once equipment now selling for as low as $499.
Hewlett-Packard's Deane said his company had reached the conclusion that without the new CD-ReWritable technology, ""the potential market would top out at a fairly low number.""

41,"Netscape Communications Corp. stock was battered for the second time in less than a week on Tuesday following cautionary comments by a Wall Street analyst regarding the Internet software company.
Merrill Lynch analyst Bruce Smith said in a research note that Netscape had scrambled to make its fourth-quarter goals in a way that could hurt its current first quarter and the outlook for all of 1997.
Netscape stock tumbled more than 10 percent, dropping $4.50 to $42.25 on the Nasdaq market on volume of more than 6.5 million shares. The stock was one of the most actively traded on the exchange.
The stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has lost more than a quarter of its value since the end of 1996, including a drop of around 19 percent after another analysts' warning last Wednesday.
Smith said he remained neutral on the stock but cited industry sources as saying Netscape had scrambled to meet its fourth-quarter numbers at the end of 1996, which he said did not bode well for its current quarter and all of 1997.
""They closed a significant amount of business on Dec. 31 just to make the quarter, which they've never had to do before,"" he said. In his research note, Smith wrote, ""We have heard of two major deals that were closed on Dec. 31, one of which apparently closed late in the evening.""
But a spokeswoman for Netscape rebutted this.
Speaking after the market closed, she said the company did complete some of its deals toward the end of the quarter, but she denied it was pushing down to the wire to lock up deals that would make a major impact on its financial results.
""We did no deals that were of materially significance on Dec. 31,"" she said.
""Sure, we did deals towards the end of the quarter, like everyone does,"" the spokeswoman added.
Last Wednesday, the stock tumbled after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst William Gurley cut his rating on the stock to ""accumulate"" from ""buy"" and cited risks from its transition to a new business plan and new pricing.
Several other analysts, including Goldman Sachs's Michael Parekh and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s Mary Meeker, have put ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings on the stock, recognising near-term risks but remaining upbeat on the stock in the longer term.
"
41,"KLA Instruments Corp. and Tencor Instruments said Tuesday they will merge in a stock deal that would create a semiconductor capital equipment powerhouse with combined revenue exceeding $1 billion.
Analysts said the deal creates a powerhouse in the critical market for semiconductor capital equipment that can be used to closely monitor production and improve yields. This capability has become ever more important as the cost of computer chip-making plants soars into billions of dollars.
""This company in their particular segment of the equipment market is just invincible,"" said Gus Richard, Hambrecht and Quist semiconductor capital equipment analyst. ""KLA's been the dominant player and Tencor's been a very, very strong second.""
The new company will be able to provide essentially one-stop shopping for chip process and diagnostics equipment.
Richard said the combined product offerings will enable semiconductor manufacturers to augment incremental capacity by identifying and eliminating scrap earlier in the process.
At current prices, with a total of 85.6 million shares outstanding after the stock swap transaction, the deal is worth roughly $3.4 billion, or nearly 3.5 times revenues, which analysts said was a reasonable valuation.
The companies said the deal, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, will be accounted for as a pooling of interests and set up to qualify as a tax-free reorganization.
Under terms of the merger agreement, the companies said shares and options for KLA Instruments common stock will be exchanged for outstanding shares and options of Tencor on the basis of one KLA share for each Tencor share.
The combined company, which aims to provide the most comprehensive measurement and analysis systems for yield management available to the semiconductor industry, will employ more than 3,900 people worldwide.
The companies said the deal was expected to close during the quarter ending June 30, 1997.
The new company, to be called KLA-Tencor,  aims to combine complementary product lines to create a full-line supplier of yield management products and services. KLA is based in San Jose and Tencor in nearby Milpitas, Calif.
The merger comes as semiconductor equipment stocks have been rebounding from a cyclical downturn in mid-1996, when tumbling prices for memory chips due to sharply increased capacity and insufficient demand chilled the sector.
KLA's stock hit a 52-week intraday high of $41.625 before closing at $40.875, up 87.5 cents on the day. Tencor also hit a year intraday high of $31.25 before before closing at $30.50, up 43.75 cents.
The merger was announced after the close of trading in the Nasdaq market.
After hours, shares of Tencor were reported soaring as high as $37, while KLA fell as low as $39 on the news.
""It's one of the most rapidly-growing segments of the equipment market,"" Richard said. ""These two players are the dominant players in the market and what's amazing is their product offerings are almost completely complementary.""
Analysts said executives of the companies told them in a conference call that their lawyers anticipate no regulatory obstacles, although the analysts said in some areas the companies control some 60 percent to 70 percent of certain markets.
KLA Chairman Kenneth Levy will become chairman of KLA-Tencor, while Tencor Instruments Chairman, President and Chief Executive Jon Tompkins will be Chief Executive of the new combination, the companies said.

41,"International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Development Corp unveiled the company's next productivity suite, SmartSuite 97, and said the product will begin shipping in January.
Lotus President Jeff Papows said on Sunday night the company will continue to add Internet functionality, with a further upgrade planned in the first quarter of 1998.
He took a shot across the bow of Netscape Communications Corp's aspirations in challenging Lotus's share of the corporate marketplace.
""If they thought the browser war was bloody, just wait,"" he said of Netscape's ambition to expand its role in supplying corporate internal networks, or intranets.
""This will be a whole new level of bloodiness,"" he told reporters after the launch of the new SmartSuite package on the eve of the Comdex annual computer show here, the largest industry trade gathering in the United States.
Lotus executives made clear Lotus plans to continue building new features into its applications suite, while undercutting the prices charged by market leader Microsoft Corp, which dominates the market with nearly 70 percent share.
Although the new Lotus SmartSuite carries an estimated retail price of $399, current Lotus applications users, or those using competing products, may upgrade for just $149.
Those buying the current SmartSuite edition through year-end 1996 will receive a free upgrade and a $50 rebate, bringing the effective price to $99.
Users of certain recent Corel applications packages will be allowed to trade these in for a free CD upgrade to the current SmartSuite for Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 by year-end.
Papows cited a 1996 International Data Corp survey showing the size of the suite application market growing from around $4.4 billion in 1997 to around $6 billion by the year 2000.
Lotus achieved a 26.3 percent share of unit volume in the third quarter, according to IDC data, and has benefited from nine million units sold through computer makers worldwide in the first year of its preloading program.
Online registrations in this program have been rising 600 percent quarter over quarter this year, and retail sales have soared 65 percent, the Lotus executive said.
Lotus aims to differentiate its productivity suite by providing the ability to easily find, share and collaborate, as well as publish, using Internet technology.
SmartSuite 97 works on Microsoft's 32-bit Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems, and permits users to drag and drop Internet information for use on the desktop, dynamically update spreadsheets and conduct searches over the Web.
Lotus product managers also gave previews of Lotus Components for the Internet ""applet,"" due to be released in 1997, to create spreadsheets, charts and diagrams within applications. An applet is a small program, written in the Java environment developed by Sun Microsystems Inc.
Lotus said it currently has some 300 to 400 programmers working in Java -- roughly equivalent to the numbers that Sun's JavaSoft unit itself has had, although Sun now plans to accelerate its number of Java programmers to around 700.

41,"U.S. high tech venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the seasonally-slow third quarter vs. overall U.S. venture investment growth of 25 percent from year-ago levels, according to a survey released by Price Waterhouse Monday.
""It is so hot it's scary,"" Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview.
Venture investment in high technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.
Software investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 alone reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.
For the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.
""Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year,"" Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.
The third quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.
""Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second-quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months,"" said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association.
""But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.""
Companies in the start-up and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.
On average start-up companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.
Funding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet-related companies receiving funding in the quarter exceeding the year-ago period by six times.
In a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.
Typically the two regions account for some 40 percent to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.
""Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic,"" because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.

41,"Calendar third quarter returns for hotly-competitive Internet stocks will reflect the sacrifice of near-term profits for longer-term growth, analysts said.
Many Internet startups are still fighting to build market share and are expected to continue posting quarterly losses.
""Everything's moving quickly, but people still have to digest the technology, and pay for it...sorting out the winners from the losers and the also rans,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investement analyst at Mecklermedia's iWORLD.  
Typical of the scurry to capture market share by making targeted investments early is Yahoo! Inc.
Yahoo!, started by two venture-backed Stanford University students two years ago to help people navigate the far-flung World Wide Web, has been building on its branded media model during its second full quarter after its initial offering.
The search engine pioneer is due to report after the market close today on its results for the third quarter, and analysts expect a $0.07 a share loss, according to First Call.  
Yahoo! has begun opening metropolitan services in U.S. cities and internationally in Japan and Britain; subject-area services such as quotes and map or individual lookup pages; and demographic offerings like Yahooligans for kids.
Yahoo! has already supplied clues to its quarterly performance potential.  Last week it released traffic figures showing it had one billion full-page ""hits"" in the quarter.
Also expanding internationally, in league with overseas media firms such as Bertelsmann AG, is navigator firm Lycos Inc, which last month reported a loss of $0.16 a share for its fourth fiscal quarter ended in July.  
Infoseek Corp, which has tuned its speedy search technology to target business users in particular, is due to report a third quarter loss of $0.18 a share on October 21.
And on the same day, Excite Inc, which bought out rival McKinley Group this summer and which like Yahoo! and Infoseek has been expanding personalized searching, is expected to post a $0.35 a share loss for the quarter.
Like other subgroups of the Internet sector, financial analysts expect further consolidation in the sector over time.
Netscape Communications Corp is prominent among the handful of Internet-linked shares seen reporting profits.  
By shifting from browsers to tools, Spyglass has racked up steady profits.
Among Internet service providers, First call consensus estimates for Netcom On-Line Communications Inc are for a loss of $1.25 in its third quarter, wider than $0.49 a year ago, while PSINet Inc is expected to narrow its loss to $0.29 from $0.40 in the year-earlier third quarter.
Open Market Inc, which Tuesday unveiled a deal with AT&amp;T Corp, is seen posting a $0.23 a share third quarter loss.  
""This convergence of capital, creativity and opportunity is unprecedented in at least 15 or 20 years and that makes for some hot growth, top and bottom line, but it still takes time to build that bottom line,"" said Harmon.

4,"National Mutual Holdings Ltd managing director Geoff Tomlinson said on Thursday that strong investment markets meant group earnings for the 1996/97 year were likely to be in line with the July prospectus forecasts.
""It's been a very kind year. I can't think of when the markets have been more conducive to our type of business,"" Tomlinson told Reuters in an interview.  
He said he could not give a formal forecast of the profit result for the just completed year to September 30 but an examination of the assumptions in National Mutual's share offer document would show the forecasts were likely to be met.
""You can go back and look at the investment assumptions in the share offer document and compare them with where we were at the end of September and we were in the fortunate position where most of the markets finished in line with predictions,"" he said.
""That would give you some underlying view that it's likely that our performance will be in line with that projection.""  
National Mutual forecast in its offer document a consolidated net profit after tax of A$198 million for the year ending September 30, up from A$115.5 million in 1994/95.
The assumptions underlying the forecast included an Australian 90 day bill rate of 7.5 percent as at September 30, a 10-year bond rate of 8.75 percent at September 30 and a U.S. 10 year bond rate of 6.50 percent as at September 30.
The offer document, issued before National Mutual demutualised and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange last month, said its profit was not significantly sensitive to its stock market assumptions.

4,"News Corp Ltd chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch, visiting Australia for News' annual meeting next week, says his global media group remains on track to boost profits by 20 percent in 1996/97.
Murdoch, in a newspaper interview published on Friday, also ruled out any potential News Corp bid for Australian newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd and said Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd had repeatedly tried to sell its 15 percent Fairfax stake in the last year.
News Corp owns about five percent of Fairfax.  
Rejoining his recent feud with CNN owner Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch also said he was confident his law suit against the two would succeed.
Turner said on Thursday that Murdoch's lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc and Time Warner was a ""frivolous piece of junk.""
Murdoch said he was confident he would win the legal action launched last week to block the Turner merger with Time Warner.
""We've got a good stoush (fight) there,"" Murdoch said.
""We'll win through there. How or where I don't know but we'll just keep the pressure on,"" he said.  
Murdoch repeated News' bullish outlook for profits.
""If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly (the 20 percent rise is attainable),"" he told News Corp's Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane.
""But it is still early days to be saying that,"" the newspaper quoted Murdoch as saying.
News Corp said after its 1995/96 results in late August that a 20 percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was very attainable. News posted a A$1.02 billion net profit in 1995/96.  
Murdoch then said the government's investigation of the current cross-media rules, which stop the dual ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same city, would benefit Packer. Murdoch predicted the cross-media restrictions would be removed, but that foreign ownership rules would stay.
""So it will leave things open for him (Packer) and not for us,"" Murdoch said.
The rules currently stop Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd from increasing its 15 percent holding in Fairfax while it owns the top-rating Nine Network.  
They also stop Murdoch's News from increasing its 15 percent stake in the Seven Network Ltd while it owns News Ltd newspaper publishing change. Foreign ownership rules stop News from increasing its five percent stake in Fairfax.
Asked what he expected to emerge from the government's investigation into the cross-media rules, Murdoch said: ""I think whatever Mr Packer wants. He seems to have very close influence with certain ministers in this government.""
Murdoch would not name the ministers.
However Packer was unlikely to push for a higher Fairfax stake at the moment, Murdoch said.  
""I don't want to buy Fairfax. I don't believe Mr (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax,"" he said.
""To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He'd like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he's too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today's price.""
Fairfax is 25 percent owned by Conrad Black's Hollinger International Inc, which is majority owned by Hollinger Inc.  
Murdoch also criticised the conservative government of Australian prime minister John Howard for not implementing decisive changes to boost the economy.
""If you're going to make radical changes, you'd better make them in the first year,"" Murdoch said of the government, which defeated the Labor government in the election on March 2.
""I think they've been slow to do that and not appearing as radical a government as I would have hoped,"" he said.

4,"Global media group News Corp Ltd must report a sharply stronger second quarter profit this Thursday or it will fail to achieve its 20 percent growth target for the 1996/97 year, analysts said.
News Corp is expected to report a second quarter net profit before abnormals of between A$450 million and A$490 million, taking first half net profits to between A$735 million and A$775 million.  
This compares with A$285 million in the first quarter and would be up 17 percent from the A$663 million posted in the first half of 1995/96.
Analysts said strong receipts from the box-office hit ""Independence Day"" and firm U.S. television revenue would be the driving factors in the stronger result.
They said the market was demanding that News put out a strong second quarter figure after a series of below-expectation results.  
News' first half must be around 15 to 20 percent better if Rupert Murdoch's group is to achieve its August 1996 forecast of a 20 percent improvement in profits in 1996/97 from the A$1.26 billion achieved in 1995/96.
""They are going to have to get a move on in this quarter if they're going to achieve that 20 percent,"" said one senior News Corp analyst.
""If they can't get a decent rise for the quarter, people are going to panic,"" the analyst said.  
Analysts said they expected revenues from Australian newspapers and magazines and the Ansett airline operation to remain weak in the second quarter.
First Pacific analyst Lachlan Drummond said he expected Independence Day revenues to be the major factor in the stronger result.
""Television is also one area where there's room for some upside,"" Drummond said. He is forecasting A$474 million for the second quarter.  
Analysts also said a good result was likely because News was due to give a big presentation to analysts and investors on February 24 in Los Angeles and would be reluctant to disappoint them immediately before that.
""That's got everyone believing that they won't have a bad result,"" Drummond said.
The market would also watch the results commentary closely for a repeat of the 20 percent growth forecast.
Executive chairman and founder Rupert Murdoch repeated the forecast in October last year at the group's annual meeting in Adelaide.  
But analysts said company officials had been reluctant to repeat the forecast since then.

4,"An official inquiry into Australia's financial system said on Thursday it would look at recommending a relaxation of rules that currently stop big bank mergers and takeovers by foreign banks.
The inquiry, which was established by the conservative government after its March election, outlined various options for reform in a wide-ranging discussion paper and was careful not to state its own preferences.  
But it noted majority industry support for abolishing the rules stopping mergers and foreign bank takeovers and said it preferred an anti-monopolies system which treated the banking sector the same way as every other sector.
Until now the government has had the final say on bank mergers, rather than just the anti-monopolies watchdog.
Analysts said the tone of the discussion paper reinforced widespread expectations that the inquiry's final report would recommend allowing bank mergers and new foreign investment.  
""It hasn't changed perceptions that ultimately the inquiry will make recommendations that allow the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) to permit bank mergers which haven't been permitted before,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett Banking analyst Michael Pulman.
Shares in the big banks seen vulnerable to takeover have rallied since the beginning of the year in expectation that a conservative government would allow the mergers.
Possible takeover targets include the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp.  
The National Australia Bank Ltd, Australia's largest and most profitable bank, is seen as the main predator.
A policy set by the former Labor government and known as the 'six pillars' policy has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.
The conservative coalition government has said this policy would remain in place until it has considered the Wallis inquiry's recommendations, due to be delivered by the end of March 1997.  
The inquiry, headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, said in its 415 page paper any reforms should increase the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally.
It also said new technology would transform the sector.
Big banks such as the National Australia Bank have used the same reasoning when lobbying for relaxed merger rules.
These banks have said big bank mergers are necessary to compete globally and new technology such as the Internet and global competition meant such mergers would not cut competition.  
""The Inquiry sees as its key goal the identification of means to increase the efficiency of the Australian financial system, without compromising its safety and peformance,"" the paper said.
Increased efficiency was needed to complete globally, to obtain the benefits of new technology and to increase investment returns, the paper said.
It said it would consider, ""better accommodating financial conglomerates,"" and, ""relaxing some of the ownership restrictions on financial institutuions"".  
The inquiry said it was also wanted any reforms to increase competition and asked in that context ""whether there are any public policy grounds for restrictions on foreign acquisitions in the banking or insurance industries?""

4,"Australian-based insurer QBE Insurance Group Ltd said on Tuesday that profit growth was likely to surge into the high teens for the full 1996/97 year after only a slight increase in its first quarter profit.
""I'm confident that it will be in the teens, and with a bit of luck it will probably be in the high teens,"" QBE managing director John Cloney told reporters after the group's annual meeting when asked about profit growth for the full year.
Earlier QBE reported a first quarter net profit of A$28.5 million, up just slightly from A$28.0 million a year earlier.  
QBE's full year net profit rose 15.1 percent to A$123.3 million in 1995/96 ended June 30.
Analysts said the first quarter result may have been disappointing, partly due to costs linked to the installation of a new computer system, but the bullish comments were a welcome tonic.
""We're still very happy to see around 15 percent profit growth per annum,"" said First Pacific insurance analyst Greg Galton.
QBE's share price responded in kind, rising 15 cents to A$6.70 in early Tuesday afternoon trade after Cloney's comments.  
Cloney also said that QBE expected reduced expense ratios over 1996/97 because of improved productivity linked to the new computer systems.
QBE should also achieve its target of double digit premium growth from existing lines and lower acquisition costs, he said.
He also said he saw a continuation of the trend of previous years of increased dividends, but that the franking rate was likely to be reduced to about 50 percent as previously foreshadowed.  
Cloney said QBE's A$70 million acquisition of the British reinsurance assets of Allstate Insurance Co announced in September would also boost profits in 1996/97.
""That will give us in excess of 15 percent return (on equity invested) in this fiscal year,"" he said.
Referring to this strong rate of return from this latest acquisition, Cloney said QBE continued to be on the look-out for similarly profitable acquisitions.
""We are on the lookout all the time, and there are a couple of things that may come to pass,"" Cloney said, adding however that he could not be more specific.  
But he said Australia was less likely to be a happy hunting ground for QBE because other competitors and banks were prepared to bid high prices and push down rates of return.
""They're the sort of hurdle rates we set,"" he said, referring to the 15 percent-plus return likely from Allstate.
""Because we're already earning 17 percent (return on shareholders funds) we're not in the position to spend up large and say we'll get a pay back in three or four years, because it will dilute our overall earnings,"" he said.  
""So far as Australia is concerned, to acquire at the sort of hurdle rates of return we're looking for is a little difficult because I think there are more people interested in what's available here than overseas.""
Cloney also ruled out any bank acquisitions.
""QBE ought to be allowed to buy a bank if it wishes to do so but it is my own personal view and, I believe the view of the board, that we will not be doing that,"" he said.

4,"The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) rate cut on Wednesday is expected to further squeeze bank margins as competition has forced them to pass this cut on to their mortgage customers sooner than usual.
The major banks have previously delayed passing on the effect of official rate cuts to their variable rate home loan customers by around seven weeks.
They would, however, often begin lowering variable and fixed deposit rates immediately, providing a temporary widening of their margins.  
Wednesday's rate cut has seen the major banks shorten this delay in passing on the rate cut to about five and half weeks.
Analysts and some of the banks said increasing competition from non-bank mortgage lenders and the regional banks had been the major factor in this contraction.
They also said they expected this gap to narrow further when further official rate cuts are made next year.
""The implication is a bit more pressure on margins,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett banking analyst Michael Pulman.
""This all about competition,"" he said.  
""These competitive forces will end up contracting it down further, possibly down to 30 days,"" said Aussie Home Loans managing director John Symond.
Aussie, the biggest of the non-bank lenders funded by mortgage origination, said on Wednesday it would cut its variable rate to 7.49 percent from 7.99 percent from January 28 for existing customers, a gap of 48 days after December 11.
At the time of the last official rate cut on November 6, Aussie planned a gap of 46 days, which was lower than most of the banks.  
In response to Aussie and competition from regional banks like St George Bank Ltd, the large banks have cut back this delay.
National Australia Bank Ltd said it would cut its variable mortgage rate to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent from January 23 for existing borrowers, a gap of 43 days.
After the last official rate cut NAB's gap was 54 days.
In line with this trend, Westpac Banking Corp's gap has dropped to 37 days from 41 days and Commonwealth Bank of Australia's gap has dropped to 48 days from 54.  
The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has yet to announce any cut in variable mortage rates in response to the RBA's cut in the official cash rate to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.
The biggest move in the gap came from St George, which reduced the time it would pass on the rate cut for its major variable rate product to 20 days from 55 days.
St George has even said existing customers of its no frills variable rate product would receive the cut from December 18, a week away. This product provides 20 percent of its portfolio.  
Overall the average gap for the banks who have cut their mortgage rates has dropped to 40 days after this rate cut from 49 after the November 6 cut, which was also by 50 basis points.
There may, however,be a limit to how much further this gap can fall, analysts and the banks said.
A new regulatory code on credit specifies customers must be given 30 days notice whenever their interest rates are changed, creating an artificial barrier both up and down.
""I think 30 days will about see it out,"" said Aussie's Symond.  
Analysts said the banks may try other tactics to cushion the effect of this reduction in the gap, but that it would still further reduce already-bruised margins.
""It will have an effect on margins,"" said BNP Equities' banking analyst Linda Lyon.
""They'll do all sorts of other things to cushion the effect. They'll be trying to reduce their deposit rates as far and as fast as they can,"" said ABN AMRO's Mike Pulman.
""But there's obviously a bit of a squeeze there, particularly for those banks most exposed to the housing sector,"" Pulman said.  
CBA is seen as the most exposed with about 34 percent of its assets in home loans, with Westpac next on 25 percent and NAB and ANZ on about 17 percent.
The big bank's margins on home loans have already declined this year from about three percent in June to about 2.25 percent now.

4,"Transport and logistics group TNT Ltd said on Wednesday it was well placed for quite strong profit growth in the current 1996/97 year, but would continue to look at selling its currently unprofitable non-core assets.
""We haven't got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we're starting from,"" TNT Managing Director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.  
Mortimer said the non-core activities that slowed down TNT's earnings in 1995/96 were its general freight business in Australia and its Brazilian operations.
""We've dealt with the LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed and we've sold Brazil,"" he said.
""What's the saying...when in doubt shoot it or fix it.""
TNT would also look to sell other unprofitable non-core businesses, Mortimer said.
""We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform then they will be vulnerable to sale,"" he said.  
One of those non core activities is TNT's 50 percent interest in airliner leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide. News Corp Ltd owns the other half.
Mortimer said he had consistently said that Ansett Worldwide's capital base needed to be restructured to give it cheaper access to capital so it could compete properly.
""In its present structure, it's difficult for it to be optimised for News and TNT ownership because it needs access to capital at an effective rate,"" he said.
News and TNT continued to look at ways of restructuring Ansett Worldwide's capital base before selling it, he said.  
Ansett's GD Express operation based in Europe had turned around in the last year and was now going well, Mortimer said.
He said the just completed sale plans for Ansett Airlines
Mortimer said in the longer term, TNT aimed to get double digit revenue and earnings growth.
""Overall we'd like to do good double digit (revenue and earnings) growth, but we can't guarantee any of that,"" he said.
TNT's share price closed up three cents at A$1.47.

4,"Australasian food group Goodman Fielder Ltd is expected to report a slightly higher annual net profit before abnormals early on Thursday, as firmer margins in some areas are seen largely offset by higher grain costs.
""I'll be looking for some margin growth, but also there's been some strong raw materials cost increases,"" one Sydney analyst said, adding he was forecasting a pre-abnormals net profit of just under A$100 million.  
The median forecast in BZW Australia's Barceps survey of analysts was for a A$100.0 million pre-abnormals net profit for the year to June 30, 1996.
Forecasts ranged from A$97.0 million to A$102.3 million, compared with the A$97.3 million profit posted in 1994/95.
""There'll be a big impact from the grain prices in the second half and going into the first half of this (1996/97 year),"" another Sydney analyst said, estimating extra grain costs of about A$60 million.  
But analysts expected the cost of grain, a major input in Goodman's breadmaking and chicken operations, would ease back later in calendar 1996.
The higher grain costs were likely to have been offset somewhat in the second half of 1995/96 by lower packaging and palm oil costs, some analysts said.
Profit expectations are in a tight band in part because of Goodman's own comments about the result in early August.
Goodman chief executive David Hearn said then that the pre-abnormal profit would be around A$100 million.  
""We're saying that there will be a small increase in pre-abnormal profit in the 0-5 percent range from last year and since we made A$97 million last year, zero to five means somewhere between A$97 and A$102 million,"" Hearn said.
Goodman then also announced it would post abnormal losses of up to A$75 million in 1995/96, including a revaluation of its loss-making poultry operations.
This would produce a net profit after abnormals of around A$25 million, Hearn said then.  
Analysts said however most of the interest would be centred on Goodman's strategic plans for recovery from its profit slump of recent years.
Goodman Fielder shares closed down a cent at A$1.31 on Wednesday.

4,"Rupert Murdoch predicted he would win his legal battle with Ted Turner and Time Warner Inc. and said his global media company, News Corp. Ltd., was on track to boost profits 20 percent this year.
In remarks published in News Corp.'s Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane, Murdoch also was quoted as saying that he did not want to buy out Australia's other major newspaper publisher, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
News Corp. publishes major tabloid newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne, the Courier Mail and The Australian, also owns about 5 percent of Fairfax.
Discussing his recent feud with CNN founder Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch said he was confident News Corp. would win its lawsuit against the $6.7 billion merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and New York-based Time Warner, which was completed on Thursday after shareholders of both companies approved the deal.
""We've got a good stoush (fight) there,"" Murdoch said. ""We'll win through there. How or where I don't know but we'll just keep the pressure on,"" he said.
Turner said on Thursday that Murdoch's lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner, which creates the world's biggest media company, was a ""frivolous piece of junk.""
Murdoch and Turner have fought a pitched battle in recent months over the merger. At issue is whether Time Warner, the United States' second-largest cable operator, will carry Murdoch's new all-news channel that will compete with CNN.
News Corp. is seeking $1 billion in damages from Time Warner and Turner, saying their decision not to carry News Corp.'s 24-hour Fox News Service showed they were stifling competition.
""They promised me very firmly we'd have 9 million subscribers and when the day came to sign the document, they weren't there,"" Murdoch said in the interview, referring to Time Warner's decision not to carry the new channel.
Turner was forced to apologise last week for comparing Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, while Murdoch has described CNN as liberal and his executives have said Turner was monopolistic.
Murdoch also confirmed his bullish outlook for News Corp.'s profits.
""If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly,"" a 20 percent rise in profits is attainable, he told the Courier Mail. ""But it is still early days to be saying that.""
News Corp. said after releasing its results in late August that a 20 percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was attainable. News earned A$1.02 billion ($790 million) net profit in fiscal 1996.
Murdoch also said he had no plans to buy out John Fairfax Holdings, which publishes broadsheet newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and is News Corp.'s major competitor in newspaper market.
He said Australian-based rival media owner Kerry Packer was also unlikely to bid for Fairfax any time soon.
""I don't want to buy Fairfax. I don't believe Mr. (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax,"" he was quoted as saying.
""To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He'd like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he's too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today's price.""
Canada's Conrad Black, whose Hollinger International Inc. owns 25 percent of Fairfax and who has expressed a desire to take control of the group, expressed surprise at Murdoch's comments.
""(Murdoch's statement) is fairly humorous. It's a bit rich given the fact that he never stops telling me how much he would like to own Fairfax,"" Black said by telephone Friday.
""I cannot obviously comment on what the others are doing or what Rupert's motives are. The fact is that he regularly expresses to me considerable hypothetical interest in Fairfax,"" he said.
Hollinger International owns the Chicago Sun-Times, daily and weekly publications in the United States and the Jerusalem Post.
"
4,"Airline giant British Airways Plc (BA) is unlikely to hike its airfares by the full three percent agreed to last week by the world's airlines, BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall said on Monday.
The world's airlines, desperate to hold up their profits in the face of a 40-percent surge in fuel prices this year, said in Geneva last week through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that they proposed to raise passenger fares by three percent.
Marshall told reporters after a luncheon address in Sydney that BA was not as badly affected as some other airlines because of the strength of sterling against the U.S. dollar.
""You also have to bear in mind that the impact for individual carriers does depend on exchange rates in that all aviation fuel is priced in U.S. dollar terms,"" he said.
""So one has to watch what is happening to your own currency versus the U.S. dollar to see what the overall impact will be for a company,"" he said.
When asked if the recent strength in sterling meant BA would therefore not pass on the full three percent agreed to in Geneva, he said: ""I think that's quite likely.""
He said BA had increased its prices by only about one percent before the Geneva resolution because of the strong currency.
""The pound has been relatively strong against the dollar and that's why we only applied about a one-percent increase in price.""
IATA, which has 251 member airlines, said in Geneva the proposed increase, which is subject to government approvals, would apply to fares from December 15.
Marshall said the extent to which the three percent increase was applied depended on each individual carrier and how fuel prices changed through the northern hemisphere's winter.
Many European carriers are pushing for a concerted move to lift ticket prices by up to three per cent, but Asian and North American carriers were believed to be reluctant to do so.
BA reported earlier this month that despite strong traffic growth and greater productivity its first half operating profits were down 2.1 per cent compared with last year.
Part of the drop, it said, was due to the extra US$84 million it had had to pay for fuel.
Meanwhile, Marshall said he was confident the European Union would not thwart BA's plan to form an alliance with American Airlines, although he acknowleged it would take the two a long time to jump the various regulatory hurdles in front of them.
""I'm not worried about it because I don't think that that is likely to happen,"" Marshall said of a possible EU block.
On Friday the European Commission (EC) said it had formally asked BA for details of the planned alliance.
A report that the EC had said the alliance did not appear to be in the best interests of consumers pushed BA's shares lower earlier on Friday.
""There are so many precedents for similar events that have been allowed to go into effect, that to me it would be quite wrong if the European Union reached that conclusion,"" he said.
""I think things are all moving in the right direction, but it's just very slow,"" Marshall said of the regulatory process.
"
34,"European record business executives on Friday sang the praises of China's crackdown on widespread copyright piracy, saying Beijing appeared sincere in its desire to build a legitimate music industry.
European companies were eager to establish cooperative ventures with local firms that would allow them to supply music to a vast listening audience currently largely supplied from illicit music production lines, the executives said.
""The Chinese market has enormous potential,"" EMI Europe President Rupert Perry told reporters in Beijing, adding that China was making progress in its crackdown on piracy.
Beijing vowed to clamp down on pirates and prise open its cultural markets in a June agreement with the United States that narrowly averted a multibillion dollar cross-Pacific trade war over violations of intellectual property rights.
Analysts and some industry figures have cast doubt on China's commitment to wipe out piracy, but the music executives said they had been encouraged by their talks with Chinese copyright and publishing officials.
""Our conversations with Chinese officials in the last couple of days lead us to believe that they are very cognisant of the problem and doing everything that they can to control it,"" said Perry.
""The laws are in place, they have an understanding of what has to happen and yes, they have had successes in closing certain factories,"" he said. ""We believe that will continue.""
The executives, who are part of a trade delegation to China led by European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan, said they hoped to build an industry that would develop Chinese musical talent for a domestic and international audience.
The multimillion dollar Chinese music market had the potential to grow 10-fold over the next few years, industry officials in the delegation said.
""We... tried to explain to the Chinese what we could do together,"" said Polygram Far East president Norman Cheng, ""They have been pretty receptive to all these ideas.""
""This is our first round of meetings,"" said Michael Smellie, senior vice president of BMG Entertainment International Asia Pacific. ""We were encouraged.""
Music imports into China were still negligible, while pirate sales were estimated at $170 million a year, roughly equivalent to the value of legitimate sales, said Adrian Strain of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
European music companies were looking for Chinese partners to develop the local market, with former pirate firms among the potential wedding partners, the executives said.
While it was impossible to wipe out piracy with a single campaign, Beijing's crackdown on illicit production had worried illegal producers and had forced them to shift some production lines to Vietnam and even South America, IFPI officials said.

34,"An estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people in China are infected with the HIV virus but many Chinese still know little about the deadly AIDS disease it can cause, health officials said on Wednesday.
China was at a critical stage in its fight against AIDS, but a campaign launched by Beijing's communist leadership to promote ""spiritual civilisation"" -- or puritan Marxism values -- would help cut the cases caused by unsafe sex and drug use, the Xinhua news agency said.
Officials said they also planned to strengthen publicity to promote condom use.
China's official total for the number of people infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remained around 3,400.-- up from 3,341 at the end of 1995.
But tens of thousands of other cases went uncounted, a Ministry of Public Health official said.
Experts estimated the actual number of HIV infections at between 50,000 and 100,000 people, she told Reuters by telephone.
China was continuing to clamp down on drug abuse, strengthen controls on blood for medical transfusions and boost anti-AIDS education and was currently holding a three-day national meeting on the disease in Beijing, another ministry official said.
Officials would launch a series of activities in December to promote awareness and knowledge of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), he said.
""Many people do not even know how AIDS is transmitted,"" he said in a telephone interview.
The HIV virus is transmitted through direct contact with the body fluids of an infected person and can be spread through sexual contact, transfusions of infected blood or the use of dirty needles by drug addicts.
AIDS would not spread rapidly in China, although infection by all these routes was already occurring, the official Xinhua news agency quoted Professor Dai Zhicheng, vice president of the National Aids Committee, as saying.
""AIDS is spreading very fast in some neighbouring countries of China, and it is being transmitted through every possible method in our country,"" Dai said.
""China is at a critical point in its AIDS control, but some new measures will be adopted to slow down the spread of the disease,"" he said.
Xinhua said the official count of people infected with HIV was expected to approach 5,000 by the end of 1996, but doctors have warned widespread misdiagnosis amd insufficient reporting mean the real total may have long since passed 100,000.
Officials planned to set up a national AIDS control centre and improve monitoring networks. Regulations or laws on blood administration would also be published, Dai said.
Beijing's campaign to promote ethical progress, regarded by analysts as a bid to bolster the authority of the ruling Communist Party and boost socialist values weakened by economic reforms, would help in China's fight against AIDS, Dai said.
Overseas experience had shown that condoms were an effective way to prevent AIDS and China had launched an experimental campaign to promote condom use in Shanghai in 1994, said the health ministry official.
""The result was not very good,"" he said. ""Many people feel willing to use condoms if they are free... but not if they are sold.""
"
34,"China on Tuesday rolled out the memory of long-dead revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen to strengthen its drive for reunification with Taiwan and defy what it sees as foreign forces trying to split the motherland.
The 130th anniversary of Sun's birth was an occasion for remembering his work for the cause of national unity, said the official People's Daily newspaper in a front-page editorial on a national hero revered by both Beijing and arch-rival Taipei.
Sun had firmly advocated the safeguarding of both China's sovereignty and unity, President Jiang Zemin told an anniversary meeting in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People.
""It was always the unremitting pursuit of Mr Sun Yat-sen to achieve the return of Taiwan at an early date and to fulfil the great cause of the unification of the motherland,"" said the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's communist leadership.
While in Sun's day it had been Japanese occupation that kept the Taiwanese apart from their mainland brethren, Sun's unitary zeal was as relevant now as then, it said in an article that also hit out at foreign forces trying to divide China.
In fullsome tributes to Sun issued by the state media, officials rushed to appeal to Taiwan leaders to work for speedy reunification while condemning all moves toward independence.
Sun, who helped lead the 1911 revolution that overthrew China's imperial Qing dynasty, also founded the Nationalist Party which later fled to Taiwan after losing a bitter civil war against the communists in 1949.
While the Communist Party says it took up his banner of revolution after his death in 1925, Taipei's Nationalist leaders see themselves as Sun's true heirs.
The farmer's son turned doctor and radical has long been seen as a potential symbol of unity for politicians on either side of the Taiwan Strait who have walked very different revolutionary roads in the seven decades since his death.
Cross-strait relations have been sorely tested in recent years by Taipei's attempts to break out of the diplomatic isolation imposed by Beijing, which considers the island a rebel province and has vowed to invade, if it ever declares independence.
Separatism was still rampant in Taiwan, while forces both there and abroad still worked to split the Chinese nation, the People's Daily said.
""The activities to split the motherland of the Taiwan authorities have not ceased and forces for 'Taiwan independence' run wild on the island,"" it said.
""Internationally, forces still exist that interfere in our nation's internal affairs and support 'Taiwan Independence'.""
While some Taiwanese politicians have long called for independence, the ruling Nationalist Party dissmisses Beijing allegations that it harbours a hidden ""Two Chinas"" agenda and says it is firmly committed to reunification some day.
Growing detente between Beijing and Taipei ran aground in June 1995, when Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark unofficial visit to the United States, enraging Beijing.
Ties cooled further in March when Chinese war games and missile tests in the seas near Taiwan overshadowed the island's first direct presidential election, prompting Washington to send two aircraft carrier battlegroups to the area.
U.S. Navy intelligence specialists have concluded that the war games were rehearsals for a possible all-out invasion of the island in the future, a study made available on Monday showed.
While Chinese state media called on the populace to emulate Sun's revolutionary spirit, local authorities celebrated the anniversary with historical soirees and exhibitions.
Gold and silver stamps bearing his portrait would be issued nationwide soon, the official Xinhua news agency said.
"
34,"A senior U.S. arms control official said on Tuesday she was encouraged by Chinese efforts to control exports to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, but Beijing said the key issue in two days of talks was Taiwan.
The United States had been lending its experience to Chinese efforts to place controls on exports, after a pledge in May by Beijing not to repeat sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan, U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis told a news conference.
""I am encouraged by the steps the Chinese are taking,"" Davis said on the second day of arms proliferation talks in Beijing that are intended to pave the way for a visit to China by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher later this month.
""We have been working with the Chinese to ensure what I call very practical implementation,"" Davis added. ""We have already had some real success in the commitments that China has made in the areas of proliferation and their nuclear assistance to unsafeguarded facilities.""
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen had urged Washington to stop arms sales to Taiwan during a meeting with Davis on Tuesday, the official Xinhua news agency said.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan were the main Sino-U.S. arms proliferation issue.
""The most sensitive and important issue is that the United States has violated the August 17 communique by exporting large numbers of advanced weapons to Taiwan,"" spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.
Cui said Washington had broken its pledge under an August 17, 1982 communique to reduce the quality and quantity of arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a rebel province.
Xinhua quoted Qian as saying the United States should strictly abide by the August 17 communique to try to reduce and ultimately stop its arms sales to Taiwan.
In August, the U.S. Defence Department notified Congress that it would sell Stinger missiles and launchers to Taiwan, prompting angry Chinese protests.
Disagreement over arms sales and nuclear proliferation have long added to the strains on Sino-U.S. ties, already chilled by disputes over trade, copyright piracy and human rights.
After months of Sino-U.S. negotiations, China said on May 11 that it would not permit the sale of equipment to nuclear facilities not subject to international inspection.
The May exports accord averted possible U.S. sanctions over China's reported sale to Pakistan of ring magnets, which are used in gas centrifuges and can be used in the production of nuclear weapons material.
China and Pakistan have denied that the sales took place.
Washington had said it accepted assurances by Chinese leaders that they did not know about the sales.
Both Beijing and Washington have been keen to resume a ""strategic dialogue"" on security and arms issues as part of efforts to rebuild cross-Pacific relations.
U.S. arms officials say differences remain with China over the export of nuclear equipment to Iran, which Washington considers a rogue state, while Beijing has repeatedly condemned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
China does not rule out the use of force to regain control of Taiwan, Beijing's arch rival since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, and in March carried out intimidatory missile tests and wargames in the seas near the island.
Davis said Taiwan was discussed during her talks with Chinese officials but declined to give details.
She said U.S. weapons sales to Taipei did not contravene Washington's agreements with Beijing.

34,"A Beijing court on Wednesday sentenced dissident and former student leader Wang Dan to 11 years in prison, the latest hammer-blow struck by China against its tiny band of pro-democracy activists.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours to convict Wang of plotting to subvert the government, but the young dissident's family quickly denounced the verdict and vowed to appeal.
""We are angry... He received such a heavy sentence even though he was innocent,"" Wang's father, Wang Xianzeng, said in a telephone interview after a brief meeting with his son at a Beijing detention centre.
""Wang Dan said he wants to appeal,"" he said. ""Wang Dan feels everything that he has done has been above-board... it was all for China's democratisation.""
Wang, 27, was sentenced to 11 years in prison and deprived of his political rights for a further two years, the Xinhua news agency said in a long report hailing the fairness of the trial.
""Sufficient evidence, which includes written materials, witness accounts, recorded tape and criminal technical appraisal, were shown at the court,"" the official agency quoted the trial's chief judge as saying.
""The evidence is conclusive,"" it quoted the verdict as saying. ""(Wang) instigated people by saying that 'It is time we turn our words into actions'.""
Wang, who vanished into detention in May 1995, had faced a maximum penalty of death and a minimum 10-year prison term.
One of the student leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing that were crushed by the army, Wang had been one of the few members of China's dwindling band of dissidents not in exile or serving a long term in detention or prison.
A spate of arrests and detentions in recent months has left the pro-democracy movement reeling, analysts say.
Wang's conviction was a slap in the face for Western governments that have appealed to Beijing to improve its human rights record, diplomats in the Chinese capital said.
New York-based rights group Human Rights in China denounced the verdict as the result of a show trial that blatantly violated Chinese law and international standards.
Scores of police enforced tight security around the court building in western Beijing, keeping foreign journalists well away from a trial billed by officials as open to the public.
Less than 20 observers had been allowed in the court, said Wang's father, who was allowed to attend along with the dissident's older sister.
""Not one witness was summoned,"" he said. ""The judge did not uphold the justice and dignity of the law... How can writing articles constitute a crime?""
The family would have 10 days to appeal upon receiving official notification of the verdict in about five days' time, he said, adding they were not optimistic the verdict would be overturned.
The 11-year sentence had been no surprise to the family or to Wang, who had been in good spirits during their 30-minute meeting after the trial, said his mother, a 61-year-old museum researcher who attended as one of two defence lawyers.
Wang, who once promoted free debate in the campus of the elite Beijing University, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
He returned to political activism after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to Beijing's communist leadership for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
Wang's father said his son's health had deteriorated during more than 15 months in detention, but added the former student activist believed he had done nothing to be ashamed of.
""He has a clear conscience,"" he said.
"
34,"The family of jailed Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng on Friday welcomed a decision by the European Parliament to award him a prize for freedom of thought, but Beijing slammed the honour as rude interference.
The choice of Wei, who has spent most of the last two decades in jail, as 1996 Sakharov prize laureate would give him encouragement, his family said.
""I feel very happy... we feel grateful to the European Parliament for its support,"" Wei's brother Wei Xiaotao told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The Chinese foreign ministry said the award served as encouragement for action against the Chinese government that had already damaged Sino-European ties.
""It is a rude interference in China's internal affairs and judicial jurisdiction,"" the ministry said. ""We express great regret and anger at this decision of the European Parliament.""
Wei, regarded by many as the father of Chinese pro-democracy dissent and a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, was jailed for 15 years in 1979 and had been paroled for less than a year before being detained again in April 1994.
Last December he was sentenced to a further 14 years in prison for subversion and for funding democracy activists.
The European Parliament announced on Thursday that Wei had won the 15,000 Ecu ($19,000) Sakharov prize for freedom of thought, to be awarded at a ceremony in Strasbourg in December.
Former winnners of the prize, created to honour the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, include South African President Nelson Mandela and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
The award put further strain on ties between the parliament and Beijing, which on Thursday angrily denounced a recent meeting between parliamentary officials and the Dalai Lama, China's exiled arch-rival for Tibetan loyalties.
Wei was a criminal convicted of revealing state secrets and threatening state security who had broken the terms of his release. No country had the right to interfere in his case, the foreign ministry said.
The award had already harmed ties with Europe, it said.
Wei Xiaotao, who recently met his brother in jail at the Nanpu saltworks in the northern province of Hebei, said Wei would have to wait until next month to learn of the award.
""He will have to wait until our next meeting to hear about this prize... that place is very closed to news,"" Wei Xiaotao said. ""There's no chance that anyone there will here about it and tell him.""
China has in recent months cracked down hard on the tiny band of remaining dissidents who have not yet fled into exile or been imprisoned.
Leading critic Liu Xiaobo this month was sent to a labour camp for three years after he co-authored a petition calling for the impeachment of Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.
Former student leader Wang Dan, who spent four years in jail for his role in 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing that were bloodily crushed by the army, is currently awaiting trial in Beijing on the capital charge of subversion.
The award of the Sakharov prize to Wei was unlikely to change Beijing's stance on dissent, his brother said. ""I don't think it will have a big influence,"" he said.
Wei's family had no plans to use the prize money that came with the Sakharov prize, Wei Xiaotao said.
""It's his money... In the future, when he comes out, he can use it,"" he said.

34,"Chinese state media on Friday lashed out at a U.S.-funded radio news station, accusing the United States and other Western nations of stepping up ""Cold War propaganda"" against Beijing.
U.S. Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts news to China in Chinese, had been launched by Washington to create chaos and sow dissent in Asian nations, the official China Youth Daily said.
""With the broadcasts of Radio 'Free Asia', the United States is further stretching its gossiping tongue into the Asian region,"" the newspaper said in an article published on the same day a senior U.S. official began a visit in Beijing.
U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis had arrived in China for talks on arms proliferation and to lay the groundwork for a crucial visit later this month by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
Christopher's visit is intended to be the latest in a series of moves by Washington and Beijing to mend ties long strained by disputes over human rights, trade, copyright piracy and Taiwan.
Officials on both sides say relations have warmed in recent months after a string of high-level contacts, but articles in the Chinese state press on Friday took a more hostile tone.
""Although the Cold War has been over for years, the United States and other Western nations rely on the superiority of their communication and information technology to increasingly launch Cold War propaganda,"" China Youth Daily said.
""The real goal of setting up Radio 'Free Asia' is to use news media to interfere in the internal affairs of China and other Asian nations, to create chaos, and to destroy the stability of these countries,"" the newspaper said.
Radio Free Asia would only boost people's abhorrence of U.S. power politics and hegemonism, the China Youth Daily said, calling for Asia-wide vigilance against the station.
China last month told Washington to pull the plug on Radio Free Asia, created by the U.S. congress as an Asian counterpart to the anti-communist Radio Free Europe. But U.S. officials have said the local-language news broadcasts were here to stay.
The station announced on Thursday that it planned to begin beaming uncensored news to Tibet this month and to expand Chinese broadcasts next year.
U.S. commentators have suggested the station could become a new irritant in fragile cross-Pacific ties, particularly after U.S. congressmen reversed a change of name to the less contentious Asia Pacific Network.
Another potential stumbling block for Sino-U.S. reconciliation is the case of Chinese dissident Wang Dan, who was jailed for 11 years for plotting against the government after a trial on Wednesday that lasted less than four hours.
Beijing's human rights record has long been a major focus of U.S. concerns and a perennial source of dispute.
While the China Youth Daily focused on the pro-democracy rhetoric of Radio Free Asia, a separate report in the official Legal Daily took aim at the entire U.S. political system.
In a scathing analysis of the current U.S. presidential election, the newspaper said ordinary Americans had little say in the choice of their leadership.
""U.S. democracy is essentially democracy of the capitalist classes or democracy of the rich -- it certainly is not democracy of the whole people,"" it said.
Most voters chose not to turn out for mud-slinging contests between presidential candidates promoted by special interest groups, it said.
While some analysts see the Chinese media's anti-U.S. rhetorical broadsides as evidence of growing nationalist sentiment, Beijing officials say they are keen to mend fences with a nation also seen as a vital economic partner.
"
34,"Chinese officials have called for a war on AIDS, warning that the nation is in danger of losing its last chance to slow the invasion and spread of the disease, state media said on Thursday.
Time was running out to strengthen safeguards against AIDS spreading rapidly through the populations of China's neighbours, minister of the State Family Planning Commission Peng Peiyun told a national meeting on AIDS in Beijing.
""From now until the end of the century is a crucial time for our nation to prevent the spread of AIDS,"" the official Health News quoted Peng as saying.
""If we do not pay close attention to prevention, the AIDS infection will increase geometrically,"" she said.
The spread of drug abuse, prostitution and illegal blood supplies could combine with a drastic increase in sexual disease to speed the AIDS epidemic in China, Health Minister Chen Minzhang told the conference, which closed on Thursday.
Many Chinese still knew little about AIDS or the HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) that causes it, Chen said.
""Now is the prime time for prevention and control of HIV infection,"" the Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying. ""It could be the last chance. We have no time to waste.""
China's official total for the number of people infected with HIV had hit 4,305, up from 3,341 at the end of 1995, and 131 had developed AIDS, the People's Daily newspaper said.
Officials say tens of thousands of cases go uncounted, and quote experts as estimating the actual number of HIV infections at between 50,000 and 100,000.
China has blamed much of the rapid spread of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) in recent years on infection via drug addicts in southwestern provinces close to the ""Golden Triangle"" opium and heroin production area that includes parts of Thailand, Laos and Burma.
""Serious HIV/AIDS epidemics in neighbouring countries may have an impact on the domestic HIV epidemic,"" said Health Minister Chen. ""A large number of migrants provide the opportunity for the spread of HIV infection.""
Chinese health departments would continue to crack down on illegal blood banks to try to ensure the safety of blood transfusions, and would join with educational organisations and the media to spread knowledge of AIDS, Xinhua said.
Law enforcement agencies would clamp down on drug abuse and prostitution to try to cut HIV transmission through contaminated needles and sexual contact, it said.
Prostitution and narcotics abuse have both boomed in recent years as nearly two decades of economic reform weaken China's once-strict social controls.
Officials expect a campaign launched by China's communist leaders to promote puritan Marxist values to help cut infection caused by unsafe sex and drug use, but a Beijing AIDS activist said it was still unclear if the effort would really help.
Authorities should put more emphasis on education and health support for high-risk groups instead of relying on official disaproval and the police to curb their activities, activist Wan Yanhui said in a telephone interview.
China had largely failed to reach out to groups such as sex workers, drug addicts and homosexuals, many of whom still considered AIDS a foreigners' affliction, he said.
""There is not much public understanding (of AIDS)...the work done on the social side has been very weak,"" he said. ""There needs to be a change in thinking.""

34,"China on Sunday used a Long March 2D rocket to fire a scientific research satellite into orbit from a base in the remote northwestern province of Gansu, the Xinhua news agency said.
The successful launch of the remote-sensing satellite followed a string of setbacks for the Chinese space industry that have sent insurance premiums for commercial launches soaring.
""The satellite went smoothly into orbit and all instruments aboard are operating well,"" Xinhua said.
The launch of the satellite, which is designed to spend 15 days in orbit before returning to earth for retrieval, was the third successfully completed by the two-stage, liquid-fuelled Long March 2D rocket, the official agency said.
China's space industry, once much admired for its bargain prices and its strong track record of launch successes, has been plagued by problems in recent years.
In August, a domestic communications satellite launched aboard a Long March 3 rocket from Xichang in the southwestern province of Sichuan failed to reach its proper orbit.
In February, a Long March 3B carrying an Intelsat satellite veered wildly seconds after lift-off before exploding in mid-air near the Xichang space centre.
China said six people were killed, 57 injured and 80 homes destroyed in the incident. Video footage smuggled out of China by an Israeli scientist showed dozens of levelled buildings and suggested the casualties were higher.
Chinese officials said the loss of the rocket and its payload was caused by a failure of the ""inertia platform"" that operates the rocket's directional controls.
In January 1995, a Long March 2E rocket blew up, killing a family of six in a rain of debris and destroying the Hughes-built Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.
The failures, although hardly exceptional in the high-risk satellite business, have sent insurance premiums for Chinese launches soaring, eroding China's price advantage over Western and Japanese competitors.
Several launch contracts with foreign companies were cancelled following the setbacks, partly because of concerns over delays due to China's launch backlog.
China says it still has a high success rate, with only a handful of the 43 launches carried out by its Long March rocket series going wrong, and officials said this month they had tightened safety measures to prevent further disasters.
Launch vehicles would now self-destruct in the case of failure and officials would ensure people living nearby are evacuated before each launch.
In July, China took a step towards restoration its reputation for reliability when it successfully launched the Apstar 1A satellite.
"
34,"China has ordered two Hong Kong democracy activists to leave the country after they tried to petition Beijing officials over the political future of the colony, Hong Kong sources and Chinese media said on Friday.
Beijing police had told activists Wong Chung-ki and Chui Pak-tai to leave China, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Hong Kong sources said the two had been trying to petition officials over what they called the ""undemocratic"" methods being used by China to select a chief executive to run the British colony after it reverts to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997.
""The Beijing Public Security Department issued a warning to Chui and Wong, asking them to return (to) Hong Kong within a stated time,"" Xinhua said.
It was not clear if the two campaigners, both members of local councils in the British colony, had already left Beijing.
Officials of a Beijing hotel had filed a public disturbance complaint against the two for distributing materials to reporters in the hotel on Thursday evening, Xinhua said.
Anxiety has grown in Hong Kong in recent months over how much political freedom China will allow after it regains control of a colony run from London for more than 150 years.
The jailing of leading Chinese dissident Wang Dan for 11 years by a Beijing court on Wednesday awakened fears that those who criticised the post-handover, Beijing-backed administration could face a similar fate.
Chinese authorities, currently overseeing the selection of a group to choose Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive, also barred two other pro-democracy advocates from entering the country on Thursday, activists in Hong Kong said.
Officials at the Sha Tau Kok border post refused entry to Andrew To and Chan Kwok-leung of the Hong Kong Democratic Party after keeping them in a room for two hours, To told Reuters.
All four activists had planned to lobby the China-selected Preparatory Committee that will select the committee to decide the chief executive, and to appeal for a reprieve of Hong Kong's current elected legislature, which Beijing has vowed to scrap.
A copy of a statement by the activists obtained by Reuters accused China of using undemocratic methods to choose the chief executive and condemned the decision to bar their colleagues from entering the country.
Their petition urged Beijing to scrap a plan to appoint a provisional legislature in place of the elected Legislative Council, and demanded the territory's future leader be elected instead of chosen by a China-controlled selection committee.
China, which has bitterly opposed democratic reforms introduced in Hong Kong in recent years, says the official Selection Committee will be well equipped to represent the will of the colony's six million people.
The rules for choosing the chief executive would guarantee a selection that was fair, honest and without corruption, Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen told Preparatory Committee members in a speech on Friday.
Analysts said a list of candidates for the Selection Committee released on Friday was dominated by pro-China politicians. The Preparatory Committee was scheduled to vote on the list on Saturday.
China has agreed to retain Hong Kong's capitalist system for 50 years but officials have suggested that freedom of expression in the bustling colony would be limited after the transfer.
A survey published on Thursday said most businessmen in Hong Kong expected press freedom, the political system and human rights to deteriorate after the return to Chinese rule.
"
35,"AT&amp;T Corp said that the decision to wait 14 months before newly appointed President John Walter takes over as chief executive from Robert Allen made sense while he learned about a different business.
""It was something that Bob Allen felt made sense and something that made sense to John (Walter),"" Hal Burlingame AT&amp;T senior vice president for human resources, told Reuters. ""It had a lot of input from the board (too),"" he said.  
AT&amp;T appointed Walter as its new president and chief operating officer from November 1, following AT&amp;T board approval last night. Walter is chairman and chief executive of printing firm R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.
Walter will not take over as chief executive from Allen until January 1998, 14 months time, and will become chairman in May 1998 at AT&amp;T's annual shareholder meeting.
In the meantime they will work together, while Walter gets to more fully understand AT&amp;T's business, Burlingame said.  
""They will work together very tightly on all the issues confronting the business, but Bob will obviously be chairman and CEO during that process,"" he said.
Analysts had expected a full handover to whoever was chosen to succeed Allen in six or 12 months, and said the slower timetable was one reason for the stock price fall.
AT&amp;T stock was down 1-7/8 at 38 at 1430 EDT/1830 GMT in heavy volume.  
Burlingame declined comment on what Walter would be paid, except to say that his package would have a very strong alignment with the interests of AT&amp;T shareholders. Details will be available with the next 10K filing.
""Mr Walter had a very fine plan with a lot of futures built into it at R.R. Donnelley. We hav recognised that in the program we put together,"" Burlingame said.
AT&amp;T separately told a news conference that the main part of the pay would be performance-related, and that the package, while competitive, was by no means a record-breaker.  
Donnelley's last proxy filing showed Walter's compensation for 1995 as $900,000 plus a bonus of $555,000 and other annual compensation of $36,427.
Walter's predecessor as AT&amp;T chief operating officer and president, Alex Mandl, left in August to join a startup firm called Associated Communications for a package that included a mighty $20 million salary.
Burlingame said AT&amp;T started with a list of more than 30 names from executive search firms, and narrowed those down to 17 early in September, when candidates were first approached.  
A lengthy board meeting on September 13 in West Virginia whittled down the number from 17 to six. Extensive discussions took place with Walter in the last week before his appointment was confirmed.
""The (stock) market doesn't know him yet, but this a person who will be regarded very positively as people come to know him,"" Burlingame said. -- New York Newsroom  212 859 1712

35,"GTE Corp said on Wednesday that it expects to continue increasing earnings per share by at least 10 percent for the forseeable future, on revenues seen rising six to eight percent per year.
""At this point there is nothing on the horizon to suggest we should be backing off from that (earlier forecast),"" chief financial officer Michael Kelly told Reuters.
GTE earlier reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.78, 10 percent ahead of a year ago and exactly in line with analysts' consensus estimates carried on First Call.  
However, analysts were pleased by very strong growth in the business fundamentals, which included an industry-leading 7.4 percent rise in access lines and a 20 percent growth in cellular users. The stock was 2-3/4 firmer at 41-3/8 in early afternoon.
Kelly was delighted with GTE's line growth.  ""We just don't see it stopping; its unbelievably strong,"" he said.
GTE's local calling areas are mostly suburban, where families who telecommute are most likely to live, and where families have adolescent children who need their own lines -- as well as a computer or two in the home needing a line.  
On top of this GTE areas are concentrated in Sunbelt areas like Florida, where economic growth has been very strong, or California, where it is rebounding from recent weakness.
""GTE is in a position to grow faster that the regional Bells because of their concentration in suburban markets,"" said Bette Massick of Bear Stearns, noting that an end to sales of local operations has unmasked this growth.
Kelly said that GTE had worked hard to cut its customer turnover -- or churn -- in cellular services, which increases marketing costs substantially.  Targeting high value customers had paid dividends, without hitting overall growth.  
As a result, average monthly bills are $61 per month, $3 above the industry average, and churn has fallen 18 percent from a year ago.  Most customers are now on term contracts.
""Our (consumer) bad debt is coming down also,"" Kelly said.
GTE offers long distance across 31 states, including all the areas where it already offers local service -- a privilege which regional Bells will only be allowed when they have proven their own local calling markets are competitive.
It has already garnered 500,000 customers since it began in March and expects to reach one million soon after the end of 1996 at the expense of the industry's big three players.  
""...Most of our business is coming from the three traditional dominant players,"" Kelly said.
AT&amp;T Corp, MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp are the industry's big three.
Kelly said that the long distance customers gained seemed above average in terms of call duration and spending.
GTE in late August began providing customers in Tampa with a single bill for all their GTE cellular, local, long distance and Internet services and will roll this out to new regions as soon as possible.
Single billing has long been desired by the industry as a tool to retain customers, who like the convenience of writing a single monthly check, but few companies have the software in place to support it. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712

35,"Ameritech Corp. and Sprint Corp., the two biggest telecommunications companies in the Midwest, Tuesday reported double-digit profit increases in the third quarter of 1996 and said they expect more to come.
Sprint, a long-distance and local carrier based in Kansas City, Mo., said net income rose 16 percent to $312.4 million from $268.5 million in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew 10.6 percent to $3.54 billion from $3.21 billion.
Earnings per share fell to 72 cents from 76 cents, mainly because of a 20 percent stake taken in Sprint by France Telecom and Germany's Deutsche Telekom which lifted the number of shares outstanding by 24 percent.
Ameritech, based in Chicago, said net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 edged up to $519 million, or 94 cents a share, from $512 million, or 92 cents a share.
Both companies' earnings were broadly in line with analysts' consensus forecasts carried on First Call, which tracks estimates.
""We currently expect to once again report double-digit volume and revenue growth ... in the fourth quarter,"" Sprint Chief Financial Officer Arthur Krause said.
Ameritech, whose core business is local phone service in the Midwest, said revenues rose 10 percent to $3.7 billion from $3.4 billion.
""Each of our three strategies -- growing our core business, investing in high-growth initiatives and geographic expansion -- plays an integral role in our ability to create sustainable double-digit growth,"" said Ameritech Chief Executive Richard Notebaert.
Analysts were impressed by Sprint's strong showing in long-distance service, an area where industry giant AT&amp;T Corp. recently slipped up and warned of lower profits.
""Clearly this is going to be the strongest growth of the big three (AT&amp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint) in long-distance volume and revenues,"" said analyst Bette Massick of brokers Bear Stearns.
However, some were concerned that the cost of investments such as Sprint PCS, a wireless venture, were eating up profit growth.
""There is a two sided story here: the businesses are growing very well, but there is all this dilution from new ventures,"" said analyst Richard Klugman at Painewebber.
Sprint PCS is a wireless Personal Communications Services (PCS) national network being built for tiny new mobile phones designed to have better battery life and building penetration than existing cellular services, and extra features including paging.
Sprint owns 40 percent of Sprint PCS, Tele-Communications Inc. owns 30 percent, and Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. each own 15 percent.
PCS services are already operating in one metropolitan area, Washington-Baltimore, and Sprint expects to launch two more in November and to be in 15 to 20 by the year end.
The other venture is Global One, an international firm designed as a carrier of services for other telecommunications companies and as one-stop shop for multinational corporations.
It is half owned by Sprint, and a quarter each by France Telecom and soon-to-be privatised Deutsche Telekom.
For the year to date, Sprint's net income grew 27 percent to $938.5 million, or $2.22 a share, from $739 million, or $2.10 a share. Sales expanded to $10.42 billion from $9.42 billion.
Ameritech said nine-month net income slipped 1.9 percent to $1.56 billion, or $2.83 a share, from $1.60 billion, $2.88 a share, despite a 12 percent growth in revenues to $11.0 billion from $9.9 billion.
The company said international investments drove more than one-third of its earnings growth in the quarter, led by investments in Belgacom of Belgium, Matav of Hungary and Telecom New Zealand.
In the third quarter telephone lines increased by 3.7 percent to 19.6 million, while cellular customers increased by 37 percent to 2.3 million.
Ameritech's shares fell 87.5 cents to $54.375 while Sprint added 37.5 cents to $40.25, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

35,"Long distance and local telephone company Frontier Corp. said on Monday it is investing up to $500 million in a $2 billion fiber optic network being built across the United States.
Frontier said it will be the largest fiber optic network built in the United States as a single project, and will put it ahead of AT&amp;T Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and others whose networks include both old and new technologies.
Lucent Technologies Inc., spun off from AT&amp;T Corp. in September, will supply the network cable. That contract is worth at least $100 million, a source close to the deal said.
The network is being built by privately owned Qwest Communications, which began work in 1995 and has already spent $500 million. Qwest said it is open to other telecommunications partners to help fund the remaining $1 billion.
The network will connect almost 100 cities and use the technical standard known as SONET, or Synchronous Optical Network, which gives high performance and reliability.
""Used in a ring, SONET allows you to recover from a network failure in milliseconds,"" said analyst Christine Heckart of consultants TeleChoice. ""This investment will expand Frontier's network reach to customers it was hard to get at low cost,"" she said.
Frontier, based in Rochester, N.Y., currently leases its network from others. But it expects to be able to cut costs significantly by this investment, which will increase its network capacity forty-fold.
Robert Barrett, president of Frontier's Network Systems unit, said the network would begin to bring benefits in 1997, halving network transport costs, and cutting incremental network costs by 80 percent.
""Clearly it makes better sense for us to own the network,"" Barrett told a teleconference.
Qwest, a company specializing in network construction, is based in Denver, Colo. It is a subsidiary of Anschutz Co. Anschutz's owner and chief executive is Philip Anschutz, the largest shareholder in Union Pacific Corp.
Frontier will fund $350 million to $400 million of its investment from its own cash flow, and may use short- and medium-term debt for the remaining $100 million to $150 million.
Frontier's stock lost 25 cents to end at $27.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"
35,"WorldCom Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire MFS Communications Co. Inc. in a stock swap worth about $14 billion, creating a giant international business communications company.
The combined company, to be called MFS WorldCom, will provide businesses with local and long-distance telephone, data communications and Internet services all on one network -- something no competitor yet can on a significant scale.
""We are creating the first company since the breakup of AT&amp;T to bundle together local and long-distance services ... controlled by a single company,"" said Bernard Ebbers, chief executive of WorldCom.
The deregulation of the telecommunications industry early this year promises to bring end-to-end service, but neither AT&amp;T Corp. nor any regional Bell can yet achieve it because of regulatory checklists and other issues.
""We think this gives us at least a two-year headstart over our competitors,"" Ebbers said in an interview.
For WorldCom, the fourth largest U.S. long-distance company, the deal will allow it to muscle into business markets that the regional Bells and biggest long-distance providers thought they had to themselves.
For MFS it provides the long-distance connection between its metropolitan circuits that it long needed, and a very healthy premium over the prevailing share price.
The merged company will have current sales of about $5.4 billion a year, with more than 500,000 business customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia.
It will have an end-to-end fiber optic network with 25,000 miles of fiber in service or under construction connecting all major metropolitan areas in the United States.
The merger comes only two weeks after MFS's $2 billion purchase of internet provider UUNET Technologies Inc. was completed on Aug. 12. Monday's merger is expected to close within eight months, the companies said.
Under the agreement approved by both companies' boards, each share of MFS common stock will be exchanged for 2.1 shares of WorldCom common stock. Owners of MSF stock will control about 56 percent of the enlarged company.
MSF's stock leaped $9.75 to close at $44.75 on Nasdaq.
But Worldcom stock fell $3.75 to $22.625 on Nasdaq after the company said the merger would dilute earnings for three years.
Although the transaction was valued at $55.39 per WorldCom share based on Friday's closing price, the steep drop in WorldCom's stock brought the value down to $47 a share, traders said.
""Over time, I think the deal will be viewed very positively, but it will take time,"" one takeover trader said.
Omaha, Neb.-based MFS has local networks in dozens of major U.S. cities, which could help it outflank regional Bells' lock on access to local business customers. This gave it a strong bargaining position in the merger talks.
""He (Ebbers) had the only one sizable company to merge with whose stock we really wanted (to own),"" James Crowe, chief executive of MFS, told reporters.
Despite the substantial stock premium for MFS, savings would soon cover the cost of the deal, Ebbers said.
Jackson, Miss.-based WorldCom said it expects significant cost savings from reduced line and access costs. For example, MFS no longer has to build a $500 million intercity network, because WorldCom already has one. WorldCom will not have to take a share in a $450 million trans-Atlantic cable for its expanding international business because MFS is already a partner in one.
Ebbers said access charges that Worldcom pays to local telephone companies to reach their local customers would drop because MFS already has local lines to businesses in 45 U.S. cities, rising to 85 cities in two years.
Worldcom said in a separate statement that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan to discourage a hostile takeover. It said its move was not affected by the deal with MFS.
However WorldCom could nevertheless be a target for a regional Bell, tempted by the company's long-distance network, said mergers and acquisitions advisor Robert McNamara at consultant Broadview Associates.
""You have effectively put WorldCom into play with this (takeover) move,"" McNamara said.
"
35,"Fast growing telephone reseller Excel Communications Inc said on Wednesday that it expects record earnings and sales growth for the third quarter and the year, and has plans to expand into new services.
""We should have another record quarter and another record year,"" Jack McLaine, Excel chief financial officer, told Reuters in an interview.
McLaine said the company had plans to offer Internet access, home security monitoring, video service, local telephone services and eventually, wireless telephone.  
Excel reported a 350 percent rise in earnings per share in the second 1996 quarter to $0.36 from $0.08 a year earlier. The company is so far only covered by one analyst, so no consensus of expectations was available.
Excel doesn't own a single phone line itself, but uses the long distance network of WorldCom Inc to reach customers. WorldCom's planned merger with MFS Communications Co Inc , makes entering new markets easier. ""Its definitely easier if you can go to one company and buy the product where you will get nationwide coverage rather than have to go various regional carriers to package it together,"" McLaine said.  
""The move between WorldCom and MFS is a brilliant deal strategically. We have a good relationship with WorldCom and we look forward to talking with them about what these new products are,"" he said.
Excel is one of around 400 telephone service resellers which have been successfully eating into the market share of industry leaders like AT&amp;T Corp. They now account for $12 billion of the $80 billion long distance market.
Analysts say the MFS WorldCom merger will allow these aggressive competitors into high value markets which are not normally available to companies without owned facilities.  
Excel said its sales approach -- using independent sales representatives to sell to their friends, family and associates -- will be powerful in new markets.
""Our relationship sales base is much stronger than telemarketing or direct mail programs, because the sales person knows the customer, and is able to sit down with them .. and explain the product,"" he said.
In the second quarter Excel said it had 220,710 sales representatives against 98,450 a year earlier. They earn a commission based on the size of the phone bill of those they sign up.
Excel's first new resold product is paging, which it has previously announced it is launching next week. It will be using the paging network of PageMart Wireless Inc. Internet service should follow in 1997, McLaine said. -- New York Newsroom  212 859 1712

35,"With most of their third quarter results in, regional Bells are fulfilling their promise to build out more telephone lines, to put more new services on each line and to make more money doing it.
Share analysts say the Bells and GTE Corp show no signs of slackening demand and are preparing themselves well for the challenge of full competition in their local markets.
""I would characterise the quarter as a cause for celebration in just about every instance,"" said Bill Vogel of Dillon Read, a long-time bull on regional Bell stocks.
Thursday saw results of Bell Atlantic Corp BellSouth Corp Pacific Telesis Group and SBC Communications Inc, following results on Tuesday from Ameritech Corp and on Wednesday from GTE Corp. NYNEX Corp and U S West Inc report next week.
Earnings per share growth averaged 8.25 percent, ranging from 3.0 percent at Ameritech to BellSouth's 12.5 percent. All were within a cent of analyst's First Call estimates.
""Generally the bottom line results have come in as expected,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Julie Kennedy.
Annual access line growth has averaged 4.9 percent, well above levels seen in the 1980s and early 1990s, boosted by demand for Internet access, home computers, facsimile machines and extra business lines.
""The temporary scare the market had with Ameritech's line growth seems a one-off,"" said Kennedy.
Ameritech saw a dip in line growth to 3.7 percent from 4.4 percent from a year ago, but it followed a drop in advertising and seemed to reflect changed priorities, analysts said.
Pacific Telesis, which is being taken over by SBC, reported strong results which reflected a bounce-back in the California economy. The toll market, a problem area for the company in previous quarters, came good with stable market share and a 6.1 percent increase in revenues year-on-year.
Vogel said the market was absorbing competitive access providers (CAPS) like MFS Communications Co Inc and Teleport Communications LP, without hitting the Bells' growth.
""Results show that the main business lines of the Bells are untouched in both price and volume by the CAPS,"" he said.
Nevertheless, Bell shares remained muted on Thursday, with none of those reporting results moving more than 1.5 percent.
The Bells have underperformed the broad market this year, with analysts saying investors remain concerned about regulation and competition stemming from the 1996 Telecom Act.
This week's good news, in the shape of a legal challenge to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) jurisdiction over the pricing process for reselling local circuits to competitors, is still lost in the broader Bell worries.
The FCC has to review the prices the Bells can charge for access to their local customers in 1997.

35,"Soaring Internet usage is bringing the United States phone system perilously close to gridlock by tying up millions of local phone lines every evening, say industry experts and analysts.
""It is like gridlock on a highway: If you are close to capacity, traffic still moves slowly, but just add a few more vehicles and you get gridlock,"" said Amir Atai, director of network and traffic performance at BellCore.
With Internet use rising at 42 percent a year, according to industry studies, phone capacity simply cannot keep pace.
""This type of (Internet) usage on our network is growing at 10 percent a month and we are watching it closely,"" said NYNEX Corp. spokeswoman Susan Butta.
For phone networks, gridlock means fewer calls going through on the first try, more busy signals and even blocked calls, where perplexed callers hear nothing at all after dialing.
The bottleneck is essentially confined to local networks, and does not affect long distance carriers, experts say.
Industry studies suggest that if U.S. Internet penetration reaches 15 percent, it would force a $22 billion network investment by the regional Bell phone companies to support it. California currently has the highest penetration at eight percent.
""We think action is required within two years,"" when the 15 percent figure is expected to be reached, said Atai.
Short-cut solutions exist, such as using filters to sort Internet calls from others based on their destination number.
If that idea catches on, it could open a huge market for firms like Lucent Technologies Inc. and Northern Telecom Ltd., which make the filters.
But regional Bells, indignant that Internet service providers do not have to pay access charges to reach Bell customers as long distance companies do, are reluctant to pay to sort out the problem.
""Bell switch ports are being tied up and they're not even being compensated for it,"" said David Goodtree, an industry analyst with consultancy Forrester Research.
The problem has swept like a tide from California, where Pacific Telesis Group (PacTel) already has major problems, to major cities and even some suburban areas.
""We found the problem is very severe in California and east coast metropolitan areas. It is beginning to appear in some other areas,"" Atai told Reuters.
The congestion could be a boon to cable TV operators in the fight for internet market share, analysts say.
Cable modems running on upgraded coaxial cable -- designed for the high data rate of video pictures -- are expected to avoid congestion problems and should be available in volume late next year, analysts say.
The problem is fundamental to the nature of phone systems.
""The local network was designed for short calls which you make and then hang up, but Internet calls often occupy a line for hours,"" said Goodtree. Those lines may not even be carrying much data, but are lost to the system in that time.
PacTel studied some of its telephone switches in detail and found that an average Internet surf was 20.8 minutes long, compared with 3.8 minutes for an average phone call. Ten percent of Internet calls were six hours or longer.
To make matters worse, the peak hour for phone systems has now switched to 10 p.m. because of evening Internet use, throwing out the logistics of networks designed around pre- and post-lunch weekday calling peaks.
PacTel said a study of one Silicon Valley telephone switch showed 16 percent of call attempts failed during peak evening hours because of Internet traffic, and 2.5 percent of lines used by Internet service companies absorbed 20 to 36 percent of the switch's capacity.
Ultimately, analysts say Internet traffic will migrate to packet data networks, the most efficient way of routing it.
Packet networks act like traffic policemen, routing data on the next free highway away from jams, even if it means splitting up a convoy  -- the words of a phone conversation for example -- travelling to the same destination.

35,"AT&amp;T Corp's proposed successor to Robert Allen as chairman and chief executive will be a surprise, not one of those whose names have been mentioned in the press, sources close to the company said on Wednesday.
Neither Michael Armstrong, President of Hughes Electronics Corp nor William Esrey, chief executive of Sprint Corp are in contention, despite broad press speculation.
The sources declined to identify the true candidate.
AT&amp;T declined comment, as did Korn Ferry International and Spencer Stuart, the executive search firms involved.
AT&amp;T's board met earlier in the day to examine a slate of candidates put forward by the executive search groups for the post of president and chief operating officer, and sources expect an announcement in the next few days.
AT&amp;T reports its third quarter results on Thursday.
""The search had (already) been narrowed to a critical few... and the board, not just Bob Allen, will make the final decision,"" said one source, declining to be identified.
The post is vacant after Alex Mandl resigned in August to head a tiny new wireless company, Associated Communications.
One possibility is that Allen would split out the role of chief executive to the new candidate in a year or so but retain his chairmanship until nearer retirement.
Allen, a 32-year AT&amp;T career veteran would be reluctant to depart early, but in a recent press interview said he would consider it if a perfect candidate came along.
""AT&amp;T wants a world class marketer and technologist, with considerable experience of leading a major business,"" one source said.
It is unclear yet whether AT&amp;T will give a clear succession timetable in the announcement for the new post.
Armstrong, Esrey, Eastman Kodak Co chairman George Fisher and James Barksdale, chairman of Netscape Communications Corp, have ruled themselves out of the candidature, but this has not stopped the speculation.
Expectation of an earlier end to Allen's career has been fanned by AT&amp;T's profit warning in September in which it said earnings per share for the third quarter may be 10 percent below analysts expectations.
The warning crowned a bad year for the largest U.S. telecommunications firm.
AT&amp;T incurred the wrath of politicians and the media for announcing 40,000 job cuts in January, but an improved stock performance it was meant to produce has not appeared, so Wall Street and investors are not happy either.
While the company's split into three parts is going ahead as planned, the remainder of AT&amp;T is now more firmly wedded to long distance telecommunications services sector, in which competition is hotting up.
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 16 percent in 1996, AT&amp;T -- adjusted for its split -- is down 14 percent. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712 (c) Reuters Limited 1996

35,"AT&amp;T Corp. Chairman Robert Allen is likely step down early to help attract a talented enough successor to take the helm of the nation's largest long-distance company, sources close to AT&amp;T said Friday.
They said the person chosen to succeed Alex Mandl, who resigned as AT&amp;T president and chief operating officer in August to head a small wireless communications company, would expect to be able to succeed Allen, 61, well before the four years still to run on his contract.
""I think it is fair to assume that,"" said one source, who declined to be identified.
AT&amp;T would not comment on the search for Mandl's successor and whether the candidate would succeed Allen, who is also chief executive officer.
""The search by the board is a private matter and we won't comment beyond that,"" said AT&amp;T spokesman Jim Byrnes.
Analysts said one possibility was that Allen would split off the role of chief executive to the new president in a year or so but retain his chairmanship until retirement.
""I expect the (AT&amp;T) system would allow and wish Allen to stay on in a senior official position for some time,"" said Mark Bruneau at COBA MID, a consulting firm.
An ambitious candidate would want to make an early impact on the strategic direction of AT&amp;T, one source said, noting that the fast-changing telecommunications market may be barely recognisable in four years.
The sources declined to comment on possible candidates, but some names already mentioned in the news media seem to have ruled themselves out.
""There is probably more speculation out there than truth in the media at this juncture"" on the candidates, one source said.
Two candidates mentioned by the New York Times on Friday ruled themselves out. William Esrey, chairman of long-distance company Sprint Corp., said through a spokesman he was unaware of being a candidate for the AT&amp;T job.
""His contract with Sprint precludes working with competitors for several years after he leaves the company,"" the spokesman said.
Similarly, Hughes Electronics Corp. said its president, Michael Armstrong, was unaware of being an AT&amp;T candidate.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Eastman Kodak Co. Chairman George Fisher and former AT&amp;T director James Barksdale, now chairman of Netscape Communications Corp., also ruled themselves out.
The AT&amp;T board meets Wednesday, a day before the company reports third-quarter earnings, and may discuss the issue then.
Allen, a 40-year AT&amp;T career veteran, would be reluctant to depart early but said in a recent press interview that he would consider doing so if a perfect candidate came along.
Expectations of an early departure by Allen were fanned by AT&amp;T's warning in September when it said earnings per share for the third quarter may be 10 percent below analysts' expectations.
The warning crowned a rough year for AT&amp;T, which incurred the wrath of politicians, the media and the public for announcing 40,000 job cuts in January. Meanwhile, the rise in the stock price that job cuts often produce has not materialised, so Wall Street and investors are not happy either.
AT&amp;T's split into three parts is proceeding as planned, leaving the company to concentrate on its core long-distance telecommunications business, where competition is heating up.
While the Dow Jones industrial average is up nearly 17 percent so far this year, AT&amp;T shares -- adjusted for the company's breakup -- are off 16 percent.
AT&amp;T has hired executive search groups Korn Ferry and Spencer Stuart to seek an outside candidate. Officials at both firms declined to comment.

0,"The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety.
The National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors.
The league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org.
The site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies.
""Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information,"" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch ""has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy.""
In May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged.
Fraud reports from the league's site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities.
The second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts.
In third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said.
Other top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home.
The League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.

0,"An international task force working to resolve the simmering controversy over desirable addresses on the Internet released a draft plan Friday for a substantial expansion of the total number of destinations.
The International Ad Hoc Committee on domain names, formed by the Internet Society in October, recommended that seven new so-called top-level domains be added to the Internet.
Top-level domains are the three-letter designations most Internet sites end with, such as ""com"" in http://www.gm.com and other commercial sites, ""gov"" in government sites and ""edu"" for sites run by schools.
The committee recommended that an unlimited number of firms be authorised to register the new addresses, although the panel said it hoped to initially approve 20 to 30 new registration services.
Addresses for most sites are currently handed out by Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., which charges $100 for each registration.
At first, Network Solutions would continue to have a monopoly on the domain names it already controls but the committee said its ""ultimate goal"" is to have all names handled by all qualifed firms.
""The IAHC members were faced with a formidable challenge,"" said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chairman of the committee. ""We accomplished our goal, in no small part, because we were able to bring people together from around the world, via the Internet.""
The full text of the recommendations was posted on the Internet at http://www.iahc.org, Heath said. The proposal will be open for public comment until Jan. 17 and a final report is expected by Feb. 3.
New names and competing registration services should help quell disputes over popular or trademarked names.
Disputes are arising more frequently, usually when the holder of a trademark discovers that someone else is using their trademark as the name of an Internet site.
For example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV music channel fought with one of its employees, who had registered ""mtv.com,"" eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.
In another case, a journalist tweaked McDonald's Corp. by registering ""mcdonalds.com"" before the fast-food giant did and before the Web had attained its current prominence. The address now belongs to McDonald's.
Once new top-level domain names are available, 10 people or organisations could register similar names. The new top-level domains will contain three to five letters but have not yet been selected.
The committee included members from the Internet Society, which helps coordinate and develop Net standards; the Internet Assigned Number Authority, which oversees certain of the standards, and the Internet Architecture Board, which helps draft and promulgate new technical standards.
The committee also included representatives from the International Telecommunications Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association.

0,"The various sectors of the U.S. financial services industry will spar over bank reform proposals at a hearing on Tuesday before the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on financial institutions.
With most in Congress and industry ready to scrap the Depression-era laws separating banking from other financial services, one of the hottest topics is likely to be whether even broader reform is required.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is considering a proposal to allow combinations between commercial and financial firms.  
While savings institutions and insurance companies can already own or be owned by non-financial companies, banks operate under much tighter restrictions.
A Treasury Department task force recommended that the administration's bank reform proposal, expected in about a month, allow mixing of commerce and banking, permitting Ford Motor Co or Microsoft to own Citicorp or BankAmerica.
Rubin told a group of bankers at a private meeting last week that the administration has not yet made a decision on the contentious issue, people familiar with the meeting said.  
The high-level private-sector group, known as the Federal Reserve's Federal Advisory Council, also met with House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach last week.
Leach, who strongly opposes mixing commerce and banking, told the group of CEOs that their banks could be taken over by larger capitalized companies.
""They'll be at the working end of the food chain,"" Leach reportedly told the bankers according to one person familiar with the meeting. Spokesman for Leach and Rubin declined to comment on the meetings.  
At Tuesday's hearing, insurance and savings groups will oppose restrictions on commercial and financial combinations. The mutual fund industry also opposes restrictions.
Small banks, represented by the Independent Bankers Association of America, will take the opposite position, in favor of imposing legal barriers.
Federal Reserve officials, along with some consumer, agricultural and union groups favor restrictions but will not be heard from on Tuesday. The Fed will testify on Thursday along with other government agencies, while consumer gropups will testify at a Feb 25 hearing.  
The AFL-CIO recently sent a letter to the Clinton administration charging that allowing unlimited mergers would drag the U.S. economy back into the 19th century with a ""reinstatement of trusts and monopolies,"" a person who read the letter said.
Leading Democrats, including ranking minority members of House and Senate banking panels Rep Henry Gonzalez and Sen Paul Sarbanes, also favor restrictions.
Not all Republicans agree with Leach and the Democrats. Rep. Marge Roukema, chairwoman of the financial institutions subcommittee, has introduced a bill that would allow financial companies to do 25 percent of their business in non-financial markets.
And in the Senate, Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato has opposed restrictions and plans to introduce his own bank reform measure soon.
Rep Gonzalez is likely to raise questions about the possible risks to federal deposit insurance funds, some lobbyists said. Gonzalez has said conglomerate combinations should have limited access to deposit insurance.

0,"An influential economic research group is preparing guidelines on computer encryption for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.
The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support for its controversial policy on exporting encryption products -- which encode and decode e-mail and other computerized messages -- failed to win an endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although the group did discuss the administration's approach.
On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, ""this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful access.""
On all the controversial areas in the draft, ""the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide,"" John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch criminals and global terrorists, he said.
The guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be ""no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities.""
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches.
""It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not an attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt,"" Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in encryption.
The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be ""determined by the market in an open and competitive environment.""
""There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs,"" Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. ""They're an important and helpful step forward,"" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.
""They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this,"" he added.
Reinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines.
""This is not helpful,"" said Netscape Communications Corp.'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private-sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by a top-level OECD officials from the group's 29 member countries, including the United States, Japan and Germany.

0,"The Federal Reserve took another step Friday toward eliminating the barriers between banking and other financial service industries, voting to allow banks to further invade the turf of Wall Street securities firms.
The Fed Board of Governors voted unanimously to increase the percentage of revenue bank subsidiaries may earn from underwriting and dealing in securities to 25 percent from 10 percent.
Bank subsidiaries have been bumping against the 10 percent limit and earlier this year the Fed cited Swiss Bank Corp. for exceeding the cap.
Banks were elated by the new rule.
""This is a tremendous boost for banks that already underwrite securities and an incentive for banks considering this business,"" American Bankers Association managing director Larry LaRocca said.
Securities firms, however, were not pleased.
""It's as if Santa Clause delivered all the gifts to only one house in the neighbourhood,"" said Steve Judge, senior vice president for the Securities Industry Association.
Bruce Thompson, director of government relations at the nation's largest brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch and Co., said he hoped the greater latitude given to banks would not reduce the banks' previous support for Congressional action.
""We hope this does not reduce their incentive,"" he said. ""The time really is coming for having everyone put aside their own particular interests and support comprehensive reform.""
Officials at leading banks said they still wanted Congress to take more dramatic action.
""We need complete financial reform,"" Rachel Robbins, general counsel of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co, said. ""This addresses one piece of it and doesn't address it completely but until Congress can act this is a welcome action.""
For decades, securities underwriting was the exclusive purview of firms like Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers.
But since 1987, when the Fed first allowed bank subsidiaries to earn 5 percent of their revenues from underwriting, big banks like J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust have made dramatic inroads.
While the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act generally prohibits banks from engaging in non-bank activity, under section 20 of the Act banks may affiliate with firms not ""engaged principally"" in such areas. Currently, 41 bank ""Section 20"" subsidiaries have permission to engage in underwriting.
The Fed's action will add to pressure on Congress, which was already planning to review the entire scope of financial sector regulation next year.
Securities firms, insurance companies and others who opposed lifting restriction on banks in the past will likely favour reform this time around, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.
Raising the revenue cap, and an announcement last month by the Comptroller of the Currency allowing banks another avenue for entering unrelated fields, only go halfway, Litan said.
""It's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field,"" he said.
At Friday's meeting, Fed governors called for Congress to follow their lead and and revise the laws.
""We hope that the next move will be up to the Congress in this whole area,"" Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin said.
"
0,"An influential Internet organisation has backed away from a proposal to dramatically expand the number of addresses available on the global computer network.
The Internet Society, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, announced this week that instead of moving ahead with the proposal it would form a nine-member committee to study the issue.
Unveiled in August, the proposal was an attempt to quell the growing number of disputes over desirable address names.
""There just seems to be no consensus at all,"" said Don Heath, president of the society. A variety of objections and questions have been raised about the August proposal, from technical networking issues to concerns about protection for trademarks and intellectual property.
""We thought we should try to pull it all together and have a good cross-section of people to discuss it and see if we can't reach a consensus,"" he said.
The new committee ought to finish its work by early next year and new names could be doled out four to six months later, Heath said. The committee could decide not to go forward with any address expansion, but Heath said that was an unlikely outcome.
""The facts of life are that people want descriptive names and vanity plates,"" Heath said.
Disputes over Internet names are occuring with increasing frequency as more companies seek to publicise and market their products over the Net.
For example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV cable music channel fought with one of its employees who had registered ""mtv.com,"" eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.
Every site on the World Wide Web must have a unique address name. Most addresses end with one of a few three letter designations, known as top-level domains, including ""com"" for private sites, ""gov for government sites and ""edu"" for sites run by schools.
In August, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority said it would oversee the creation of up to 150 new top level domains, easing the squeeze, especially for names in the private sector category.
The authority, operating under charter from the society and the Federal Network Council, is the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards.
The society's board of trustees voted in June to accept a preliminary version of the numbers authority proposal, with the proviso that the business aspects of proposal be fleshed out.
But with the ensuing controversy, the society decided a committee was needed to reexamine the proposal, Heath said. The committee will meet confer mostly by telephone and online, though an open forum is planned for mid-December in California.
The committee will include two members appointed by the society, two by the numbers authority and two by the Internet Architecure Board.
The International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association will each appoint one member.

0,"The Internet continued to grow in leaps and bounds this year while online services found it much harder to add new customers, a survey said Friday.
An estimated 35 million adults in the United States had used the Internet, according to the poll by Louis Harris and Associates conducted in late September, up from 27 million at the beginning of the year.
""Although the number of people who use computers has fluctuated around just over half of the adult population, the number of adult Americans using computers for cyber-activities is growing,"" said Humphrey Taylor, chairman of the polling organisation.
While online services like America Online Inc. and Compuserve Corp. could lay claim to almost 41 million subscribers, that was the same level Harris found back in January.
Online services, which provide private online content in addition to Internet access, have faced greater competition this year from companies like AT&amp;T Corp., which provide cheaper Internet-only access.
Businesses, which are looking to the Internet as a potential source of new revenue, are intensely interested in figures on its usage. Differing surveys have come up with widely varying numbers.
The Harris poll found that, although more people are getting wired, they are on average spending less time in cyberspace.
Home users said they were online 2.8 hours a week, down from three hours a week in an April survey. Business and other users said they were online for 1.8 hours, down from two hours in April.
The poll also reinforced findings of earlier studies showing that more educated people were more likely to use computers and access the Internet.
People with college and graduate degrees were twice as likely to use computers and four times more likely to access the Internet as people who only graduated from high school, the poll found.
The poll's results were based on a telephone survey of 1,032 adults at the end of September and have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, according to Harris.

0,"Internet access providers and others who met with Net-savvy lawmakers said they fear Congress will wreak havoc on cyberspace but are also heartened by the growing number of legislators who understand the global computer network.
Company representatives met Tuesday night at the Capitol with members of the Congressional Internet Caucus, about 85 legislators with a common interest in the Net, to express their hopes and fears about efforts to make laws governing cyberspace.
""I think it's inevitable that there will be bills introduced that attempt to legislate the content of everything on the Internet,"" Tom Evslin, vice president of AT&amp;T Corp.'s WorldNet Internet service, said after the meeting.
Evslin said it would be as difficult to keep Congress from making wrong moves as it would be to get the legislature to act to head off problems.
Bill Schrader, president of Internet provider PSINet Inc., was more blunt. ""Be very careful or you will destroy this industry,"" he warned.
The members of Congress who attended the meeting pledged to try to protect the Internet.
""We have a lot of pretty tough work ahead of us,"" Representative Rick White, R-Pa., and a co-chairman of the caucus conceded. ""We have many, many issues coming down the pike from encryption to privacy, to copyright and taxation.""
Encyrption is the use of software to encode and decode information.
Sen. Conrad Burns, also a co-chairman, warned that, despite the caucus, legislation will always trail developments in the private sector.
""The government making policy is never ahead of the curve,"" the Montana Republican said. ""If we do the right thing now, I guarantee you that by the time it's passed and the president signs it, we'll be behind the curve.""
Last year was a mixed bag for the Internet in Congress.
Legislators passed the Communications Decency Act, opposed by online companies and civil libertarians as an infringement on free speech rights, but also defeated measures that would have imposed liability on Internet providers for copyright infringement.
Sun Microsystems Inc.'s chief scientist, John Gage, fretted that, with only 85 pro-Internet legislators out of 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate, most in Congress remained ignorant of the Net. ""We've got a long way to go,"" he said.
Companies interested in the Internet offered some conflicting goals for Congress. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, urged the legislators to impose new laws protecting Hollywood products.
""Congress cannot avoid that all intellectual property has to be protected -- this can't be Dodge City without a sheriff,"" Valenti said. But he also praised the Internet as ""the most valuable and spacious information greenhouse that's ever been built.""
PSINet's Schrader countered that existing laws already protected movies, books and other works. ""Everything is not new,"" he said. ""It's the same-old, same-old.""

0,"The Supreme Court said Monday it would decide whether a federal regulator had properly allowed credit unions to expand their membership over the past 15 years, settling a long-running legal dispute between the cooperative non-profits and banks.
Credit unions praised the court's action to reconsider an Appellate court decision last July in favour of the banks. But bank representatives said the court was only delaying the inevitable.
The 1934 Federal Credit Union Act creating credit unions ""was not meant to delineate and protect bank markets at the expense of the consumer,"" said Marc Schaefer, president of AT&amp;T Family Federal Credit Union, the credit union being sued by banks in the case.
""Consumers everywhere will be the winners when banks compete in the marketplace instead of the courts and on Capitol Hill,"" Schaeffer added.
American Bankers Association executive vice president Donald Ogilvie countered that ""the facts and law weigh overwhelmingly in our favour.""
""We are disappointed at the prospect of delay in the enfocement of a law we believe is quite clear,"" he said.
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case in its upcoming term, which begins in October. A decision is likely early next year.
The case affects about 3,600 federal credit unions serving 32 million customers, Justice Department lawyer Walter Dellinger said.
The appeals court ruling in favour of the banks ""threatens nationwide instability and losses in the credit union industry affecting millions of persons,"" Dellinger said.
Until 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, such as people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. Owned by their members, non-profit credit unions paid no federal taxes and were able to offer bank-like services often at lower prices than banks.
But in 1982, concerned about a lack of diversification, the National Credit Union Administration decided to allow credit unions to accept members from multiple distinct groups.
As many previously tiny credit unions diversified and grew substantially larger, banks complained of unfair competition. In 1990, they sued AT&amp;T Family Federal, a North Carolina union that had grown to encompass over 150 different groups.
After the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the 1982 policy change last July, a lower court imposed strict membership limits on multi-group credit unions.
Those limits have since been put on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision. But if the banks win, their next move could be to ask the courts to force multi-group credit unions to throw out members from all but one group.
Credit unions said they will ask Congress to amend the law if they lose in the Supreme Court.
""Congress never intended the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act to limit credit union growth or to protect banks from competition,"" said Daniel Mica, president of Credit Union National Association, a leading trade group. ""If the court does not see it this way, we think Congress will recognise consumers' need for credit unions.""

0,"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday urged Congress to modernise U.S. financial laws but warned that some government oversight must be maintained to avert financial catastrophes.
A top priority of regulators, Greenspan said after a speech at a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta conference here, is to prevent ""systemic risk,"" where a problem in one firm or market spreads through the financial system and ultimately undermines the entire economy.
If a bankruptcy or market crash cannot be contained, it could behave like a chain reaction spreading through all markets, he warned.
The failure of Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s, for example, raised fears that its collapse would cause a cascade of failures among large Wall Street firms and commercial banks that had lent funds to Drexel. But the firm was liquidated in an orderly fashion and losses did not spread.
Using its existing authority to oversee banks and provide loans, the Federal Reserve has been able to contain previous crises, Greenspan said. ""There have been occasions when we have been on the edge of a significant breakout,"" he said, but declined to name the institutions involved.
The Fed's actions and other rules governing financial firms ""turned out to be adequate to stem the atomic erosion,"" he said, returning to the nuclear analogy.
""Regulation, by its very nature, becomes increasingly obsolete,"" Greenspan said. ""Regulation imposed in an earlier period would be wholly or partly inappropriate for something that evolves at a later date.""
Congress is currently considering several bills to reform laws governing banks, which would affect the Fed, which is one of the nation's primary bank regulators. Legislators have also introduced a measure to modernise rules on derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on the value of something else such as a commodity, stock or currency price.
""It is important for Congress to periodically review"" such laws, Greenspan said. ""Regulators are required to do that.""
For example, in a recent review of Regulation Y, governing non-bank interests of bank holding companies, the Fed found that ""some of that stuff is just unbelievable because the markets have changed so much,"" the Fed chairman said, without elaborating.
If Congress alters the Fed's responsibilities, it should not strip the central bank of its ability to contain systemic risk, Greenspan argued. ""Having seen the inner workings of these things, a lot of the things we do actually are quite effective,"" he said.
""I would be very chagrined to see some of these powers disappear ... I say that from someone who believes the less you interfere in the market, the better.""
Under one proposal before Congress, the Federal Reserve would remain a primary regulator of financial institutions such as banks. But under other proposals, that authority could be divided among many regulators or entrusted to a new committee of federal regulators.
The Fed offered to provide loans following the stock market crash of 1987, for example, preventing a liquidity crisis that could have caused wider problems for the economy.
Greenspan also appeared to side with the Treasury Department in its long-running dispute with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the appropriate scope of U.S. laws governing futures trading.
Under a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, trading of foreign currency and certain other instruments is exempt from CFTC oversight. But federal courts have made contradictory rulings about the scope of the amendment, especially as it relates to derivatives, and the Supreme Court is expected to deliver a ruling on the issue soon.
Greenspan said Congress did not need to impose new regulations on trading of derivatives over-the-counter by sophisticated institutional investors. ""There appears to be no need,"" he said. Regulation under the commodity act ""seems an inappropriate framework,"" he added.
Even trading by less-sophisticated retail investors ""is more appropriately regulated"" by bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, not the CFTC, he said.
Greenspan's comments were significant and could affect lawmakers' decisions when they consider related legislation, an Association executive said.
""If you're going to vote on these issues and you've been kind of on the fence with respect to pro-market or expansion of CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) power, etcetera, I have to believe that his comments influence that person who's on the fence,"" said John Frawley, chairman of the Managed Futures Association.
""So if you're looking for a Good Housekeeping seal of approval, he just sort of stamped it on those who are looking for such a thing,"" Frawley told reporters at a briefing.

24,"Virginia-based Dominion Resources executives Tuesday began merger talks with British utility East Midlands Electricity in an effort to agree on a takeover price.
Dominion's chairman, chief finance officer and attorneys began meeting in London with East Midlands Chairman Nigel Rudd, Chief Executive Norman Askew and their advisers -- the merchant bank Schroders -- a source close to the British regional electric company said.
No further details were immediately available.
Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Resources owns Virginia Power.
Dominion and East Midlands agreed to talk despite East Midlands' insistence it would reject any offer from Dominion Resources pitched at around 6.08 pounds sterling per share ($10.05), which would value the British company at 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion).
In the fifth potential U.S. bid for one of Britain's 12 cash-rich regional electricity companies, Dominion said last week that it was considering an offer ""at a price not much in excess of 608 pence per share.""
But East Midlands, the first of its wealthy peers to launch a stock buy-back in an attempt to redistribute cash to shareholders, scorned the price as undervaluing the Nottingham-based utility's prospects.
East Midlands, the target of consistent bid speculation as seven of 12 regional electricity companies have fallen to predators and an eighth, Northern Electric, is facing its second hostile bid, saw its stock end 8.5 pence (14 cents) higher at 6.12 pounds ($10.12).
Dominion's stock closed up 12.5 cents at $39.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Some traders and analysts said the London market remained unconvinced the American utility would launch a bid.
Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at the Yamaichi brokerage, said Dominion would need to start merger talks at 650 pence ($10.74) per share, but added East Midlands was unlikely to recommend a bid much below 7 pounds, or 700 pence ($11.57).
""I do not believe East Midlands would recommend a bid siginficantly below 700p per share,"" he said. ""I am not saying they would refuse it at the 690p ($11.40) level.""
Traders also emphasised that Dominion could still walk away from the talks amid regulatory and political uncertainties.
A Dominion Resources spokesman has said the U.S. company was well aware of the uncertainties that surround the purchase of a British electrical utility.
A lull in a wave of bids for electric companies came to an abrupt halt last month when CE Electric -- jointly owned by CalEnergy Co. and Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. -- launched a hostile 650 million-pound ($1.07 billion) bid for Northern Electric.
The Nebraska-based utility has built up a stake of around 29.5 percent in a series of market raids on Northern Electric, which became the first regional electric company to be faced with a takevoer attempt in December 1994.
A costly shareholder package in defence against the unwanted attentions of conglomerate Trafalgar House left Northern Electric with high debts.

24,"British Telecommications beat even the most optimistic analyst forecasts on Thursday with robust second quarter and first half profits and insisted it was growing despite ever stiffer competition.
BT, which plans to merge with America's MCI to create Concert, one of the world's biggest telecoms groups, said profits before tax, redundancy and restructuring charges rose 7.4 percent in the quarter and 5.2 percent in the first half.
But after a hefty 235 million pound ($388.2 million) of redundancy costs and a 60 million pound charge for the repurchase of government-held bonds, half year pretax profits came in at 1.6 billion pounds and 730 million pounds in the second quarter -- slightly below the corresponding 1995 figures.
BT, whose shares were 8.5 pence higher at 369p in heavy trade after a high on the day of 371, managed to hang onto its 20.5 million residential customer lines despite predictions that competition from cable companies would dent its market share.
""We're growing, we're not going backwards,"" finance director Robert Brace told Reuters in an interview, noting that turnover in the six months rose 4.5 percent to 7.37 billion pounds.
""I think telecoms is one of the most exciting growth industries in the world,"" he said. ""When we open (the markets) up, drop the prices, raise the quality of service, and really market hard, the growth levels are double digit.""
The group also said its biggest business, inland calls, grew one percent to over seven percent in the quarter on a 12 month moving average basis after price cuts and marketing initiatives.
But chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield told a news conference BT was probably losing one to two percentage points of a growing British telecoms market, and that this trend was likely to continue, forcing BT to turn abroad for profit growth.
""BT will lose profits in the short term,"" said James Ross, telecoms analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, who expects BT to post a full year pretax profit of 2.1 billion pounds. But he said BT was well placed to fight competition at home and abroad.
""They are the group that has done the best (abroad) so far and in the UK, they have protected their position,"" he said.
Brace said BT planned to ""get very aggressive"" in the next two years as European telecoms markets are opened around 1998.
BT expects to win more than 30 percent of revenues from its six continental European joint ventures after liberalisation. Those ventures, worth about $135 billion, could start contributing profits after five to seven years, Bonfield said.
The group plans to take a substantial market share of the lucrative big business, data and mobile services markets.
Bonfield said BT, which expects 1996/97 capital expenditure to be around 2.7-2.8 billion pounds, still saw a link-up with a partner such as Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone a high, long-term priority for a ticket into booming Asia.
""I'd really hate to be knocked out by another competitor just because we weren't treading the boards,"" he said.
While Japan was mulling the future structure of NTT, BT would make sure it was ""parading outside the door"", he said.
BT operates in 30 countries and employs about 130,000 staff worldwide. Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. Another 3,200 staff left in the first half of this year with about 3,000 more voluntary redundancies expected this year.
Asked whether BT planned similar deals to its $20 billion MCI merger, Brace said: ""I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with,"" he said.
BT had already planned a six percent half year dividend rise to 7.9 pence. As part of the MCI deal, BT is also paying a 35p special dividend in September 1997 on top of the final dividend. ($1=.6054 Pound)
"
24,"British Telecom unveiled the largest transatlantic deal in history on Sunday, linking up with America's MCI Corp in a $20 billion merger that catapults it into second place in the world's international telecoms market.
The deal with MCI -- the number two U.S. long-distance phone company after U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T Corp -- creates a $54 billion group to be called Concert Plc, which will have 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.
""Tomorrow begins a new era for all of us as we go forward in Concert and harmony,"" Gerald Taylor, MCI's president and chief operating officer told a news conference.
In an attempt to keep one step ahead of rivals as world telecoms markets are liberalised, BT is taking on a partner with a powerful position in the world's biggest telecoms market, generating about 40 percent of the world's long-distance calls.
Under the deal, which has yet to win regulatory approval on both sides of the Atlantic, MCI shareholders would receive up to 2.3 billion pounds ($3.77 billion) cash and new Concert American Depositary Shares. For each MCI share, investors will get 5.4 new BT shares and $6.0 cash, valuing MCI shares in the mid $30 each.
BT is also paying its 2.4 million shareholders a special dividend bonanza of 2.2 billion pounds, or 35 pence per share, which is not dependent on any completed merger.
The company also said it would ask shareholders to approve plans for its first ever share buy-back at an extraordinary meeting to approve the MCI deal.
BT, whose motto ""It's good to talk"" appears to have paid off since alliance talks failed with British rival Cable and Wireless six months ago, already owns 20 percent of MCI.
Sir Peter Bonfield, BT's chief executive, denied that the deal with MCI was the second best choice for BT, which has been keen to get access to the world's fastest growing telecoms market -- Asia -- via Cable and Wireless's 57.5 percent stake in the highly-profitable Hong Kong Telecommunications.
""It's not second best, it's first best,"" he told the news conference.
BT already has a joint venture with MCI called Concert, which provides a whole range of communications services to customers in more than 50 nations. MCI also carries 40 percent of the worldwide traffic on the Internet.
""The merger combines the substantial financial resources and global position of BT with the growth momentum and market expertise of MCI, known for its success in the competitive U.S. long distance market,"" BT said in a statement.
The new telecoms giant, which will have annual cash flow of about 7.5 billion pounds, will be incorporated in Britain with headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the BT and MCI brand names in Britain and America.
BT expects the merger, after an initial five percent earnings dilution, to yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds over the first five years and 500 million pounds pre-tax annually after that.
BT also forecast dividends of 19.85 pence per share for the year to March 31, 1997 -- a rise of six percent over last year -- excluding the 35 pence per share special dividend.
BT, which will release full year results on November 14, has declared a half-year dividend of 7.90 pence payable in November, six percent more than in the same period last year.
The deal is believed to be the second largest ever involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.
Analysts said a combined company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry, where MCI's major competitors are AT&amp;T Corp and Sprint.
Current market leader AT&amp;T, which would be the hardest hit by a financially muscular new enlarged rival, said on Friday it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government. ($1=.6096 Pound)
"
24,"British Telecommunications (BT) on Friday played down top level talks with Japanese telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp but analysts refused to rule out that the companies were hatching a deal.
Since the talks were announced on Thursday, speculation has swept the market that BT, which along with its American partner MCI Communications has been openly courting NTT, might be on the brink of a link-up.
But a BT spokesman told Reuters: ""That meeting was of no particular significance. We have regular contacts at that level and will continue to do so with NTT and others.""
While BT is playing its cards close to its chest, some analysts speculated that the company, keen to get a foothold in the lucrative Asian telecoms markets via the world's biggest telecoms player, might hammer out a deal with NTT quite soon.
""I think that they are quite close to it,"" said John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at brokers SocGen Strauss Turnbull. But he added: ""That is just instinct.""
One analyst even said he had made a bet with a colleague that a deal would be signed or announced before the end of February. But others were split.
""You would expect in the next 12-18 months something to happen,"" said Chris McFadden, analyst at Merrill Lynch, adding: ""If it happened tomorrow, we'd be all pleasantly surprised.""
Another said he thought an imminent ""memorandum of understanding"" between the two companies was quite possible. But he added: ""But in terms of any tangible, real tie-up, I would put it later in the year.""
But analysts agree on two things. They dismiss as a ""courtship ritual"" NTT's statement that it might prefer to branch out into the global international market on its own.
They also believe that NTT will want to be calling the shots on any deal.
NTT may even stop short of a straight deal with BT and MCI's Concert alliance, preferring to link up with more than one global alliance. ""On a selected basis, they may link up with as many as possible,"" said one analyst.
At present, there are three main alliances.
Apart from Concert, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint have formed Global One. The third consortium is WorldPartners, a loosely-knit organisation created by U.S. telecoms gaint AT&amp;T.
Members include Unisource, a venture of PTT Telecom of the Netherlands, a Swedish firm, the Swiss service provider, Spain's Telefonica and a stack of Asia-Pacific members such as Hongkong Telecom, Australia's Telstra and Korea Telecom.
BT's chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield is also travelling to Japan at the end of this month, part of a regular trip where he is likely to meet NTT executives, BT says.
BT has had an office in Japan for 10 years and already has a minor link with one of NTT's units, NTT Data, which distributes its Concert Internet Plus services.
It sent its first regional director to Tokyo this year in a move to highlight the growing importance of the area.
"
24,"A war of words between Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) and its watchdog broke out on Friday after the company rejected stringent price cut proposals and asked for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) referral.
Charles Coulthard, Northern Irish deputy director general for electricity supply, accused NIE of trying to raise prices by rejecting his plans that would chop more than 300 million pounds ($467 million) off revenues over a five-year period.
""...when I had expected that NIE would be working with me to tackle the problem of Northern Ireland's high electricity costs they instead have chosen for the first time since privatisation to deliberately seek to increase the price which customers in Northern Ireland must pay for electricity,"" he stated.
Patrick Haren, NIE chief executive, scorned the statement as ""garbage"" and ""quite disgraceful"". He reminded Coulthard that under NIE's proposals, average domestic customer power bills would fall by 35 pounds next year, rising to 50 pounds per year by 2002.
""I have never heard anything so oustandingly outlandish,"" he told reporters. ""Where on earth the man got this...from is beyond me. We unreservedly refute the nonsense of it.""
""If this is what passes for dialogue at Offer (the Office of Electricity Regulation) it is quite obvious why we need to have our review assessed by the MMC.""
NIE's troubled shares hit another year low of 322 pence, a loss of 11 pence. Most analysts had been surprised at the savage review, but did not believe the group would risk further uncertainty by asking for a lengthy MMC investigation.
Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Yamichi, said the MMC referral may prompt a similar move by National Grid, the electricity transmission network, which last week urged its shareholders to help fight its own price review.
""They (NIE) have a stronger balance sheet than National Grid, so if they think they have a lousy deal then National Grid could well follow suit,"" Hawkins said. NIE chairman David Jefferies is also the chairman of the National Grid.
NIE is proposing a 22 percent one-off price cut next year followed by a three percent cut in power bills in each of the next four years -- a level it calls tough but sustainable.
However Offer's Northern Irish office wants prices across NIE's three main businesses cut by an average one-off 31 percent, or 68 million pounds, next April followed by a two percent cut in annual charges in the following years.
Bills in Northern Ireland have traditionally been about 20 percent higher than in England and Wales, partly because of the sparse population in the area. It has around half the customers of the smallest English and Welsh regional electricity groups.
NIE also blames escalating oil prices and the high prices independent generating companies charge. They account for about 60 percent of customer bills.

24,"Intel Corp launched its new Pentium chip with multimedia extension (MMX) technology on Wednesday, promising TV-quality video, stereo surround sound and three-dimensional graphics for personal computers.
The world's largest computer chip maker, Intel has collaborated with more than 100 software developers, some of which have created programs such as UbiSoft's dizzying new car race game called Pod' especially for Intel's Pentium processors that have the new MMX technology.
""This means life-like colour, full screen video and graphics, CD (compact disk) quality stereo sound, real-time animation and a better Internet experience,"" Intel said.
Long-awaited in the computer market, the MMX has helped drive Intel shares to record levels over recent weeks and is expected by industry watchers to boost computer sales.
Intel shares rose a further four dollars on Tuesday to $143-3/8 but were down slightly in active early Wednesday trade.
Trumpeting MMX as a ""giant leap forward"" for PC users, European technology director Ian Wilson told Reuters that new multimedia software written to take advantage of MMX technology ran up to 60 percent faster than on Intel's previous Pentium processors. Existing software runs up to 10-20 percent faster.
Intel says the new technology will boost computer sales and soon become an industry standard.
""The new features we have introduced with MMX technology allow a much better, richer multi-media experience...and we'll see a home and consumer demand for PCs growing even more,"" Wilson said.
Intel said that for the first time in its history, a wide range of consumer software was available right at launch to exploit the powers of the new chip.
The MMX chip will initially be offered with the 166 and 200 MHz Pentium processors, improving the performance of personal computer-based multimedia and high-speed communications with faster ""modems"" for speeding access to the Internet.
A host of computer manufacturers are offering the Pentium MMX processor, including America's International Business Machines Corp, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Italy's Olivetti and Japan's Toshiba.
British electrical retail chain Dixons said new Pentium processors with MMX technology would be available in some of its stores from Wednesday.
Wilson said he expected systems incorporating the new MMX technology to retail at between $1,500 and $2,000.
Analysts have estimated that Intel could sell 30 million to 45 million MMX chips this year -- about half of the microprocessor units it will sell this year.
But Wilson declined to comment on shipments, saying only: ""By end of year, a significant percentage of our microprocessors being shipped will be incorporating MMX technology.""
The MMX chip, which is available on desktop PCs as well as on low-power portable computers, contains 4.5 million transistors and adds 57 processor instructions to speed up software instructions.
The added performance of the technology frees up more of the Pentium processor to work on several tasks at once, including low-cost PC videoconferencing over standard telephone lines.
Intel said it planned to build technology to upgrade some of its older Pentium processors later this year.
The company does not expect a re-run of its experiences in 1992, when it was forced to recall hardware because of problems with its processor chips.
""I think we have learnt a lot from that experience,"" Wilson said. ""We're very confident of the quality and reliability of the product we are shipping.""

24,"As Japanese telecoms titan NTT mulls an investment with British Telecommunications (BT) in France, analysts said on Thursday any such deal would be a major coup for Britain's dominant telecoms operator.
One investment banker told Reuters that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the world's biggest telecoms company, had approached probably more than two investment banks to evaluate an investment alongside BT in the French telecoms market.
""I am aware approaches have been made and I am also aware that strategically and commercially this is an opportunity which has been given a lot of attention within the senior management of NTT,"" he said.
With further details largely confidential, the investment banker said only that BT was also exploring whether to strengthen its 1.1 billion pound ($1.8 billion) investment in a 25 percent stake in France's new telecoms operator Cegetel.
Cegetel, which was set up by Cie Generale des Eaux, is seen as the main rival to France Telecom.
""What is being looked at these initial stages is much more to do with access to international traffic and strategically, from NTT's perspective, how it can enter the market,"" he said.
BT declined to be drawn on reports that NTT was evaluating a 300 million pound ($490.3 million) investment -- or whether it would welcome such a link. But along with its American partner MCI, BT has been openly courting NTT along with MCI for many years.
And major deal in Japan has become increasingly urgent since the NTT was last month freed by the government to pursue international business.
But a BT spokesman would only say: ""If NTT have appointed investment bankers that is their decision.""
All three global telecoms alliances are vying to get a foothold in the lucrative Asian markets so that they can sell their services to multinational firms.
""If BT were able to get NTT to take this step in France that would be a significant coup for BT because it would be the first step towards tying them in to (BT's) global Concert alliance,"" said Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers.
""Japan is the last major frontier for the world telecoms companies...And if you're going to service multinationals, you've really got to be in Japan,"" he added.
NTT is the obvious partner choice as it controls virtually all of the local network in Japan as well as having a large presence in Asia.
And there are three main global alliances eager to link up with the group; BT and MCI's Concert, Global One, which incorporates France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and America's Sprint and U.S. telecoms gaint AT&amp;T's loosely-knit global alliance.
But while speculation is swirling that NTT may first move in France, the investment banker said he would be surprised if the group wasn't looking for alliances right across Europe.
France is one of the most important European markets, but companies such as Italy's STET are also looking to see whether they can forge international partnerships with other operators.
""I would think NTT would be looking at a toe-hold in the top four or five markets in Europe,"" he said. ""(It seems) discussions within NTT have moved onto a more advanced stage and I would be surprised if their efforts were being focused exclusively on France. But that is pure speculation.""

24,"Cable &amp; Wireless (C&amp;W) on Friday brushed aside speculation that its landmark merger with three companies had run into hurdles and said it had got the man it wanted to run what will be Britain's biggest cable firm.
In a long-awaited statememt, C&amp;W said it would appoint Graham Wallace as chief executive of Cable and Wireless Communications, formed by merging C&amp;W's Mercury unit, Nynex Corp's NYNEX CableComms Group, Bell Cablemedia Plc, and Videotron Holdings Plc.
""Graham Wallace is the one we wanted,"" C&amp;W chief executive Richard Brown told Reuters in an interview.
""He is the first choice and we're delighted to get him.""
Wallace, who will join C&amp;W on February 1, is currently a director at leisure and media company Granada Group. But he brings with him useful experience in television from a stint on the board of satellite broadcaster BSkyB.
C&amp;W, is mainly a telecommunications business and has little previous experience in television.
But one analyst gave the appointment a lukewarm reception.
""It's not an obvious choice,"" said the analyst. ""He strikes me as very competent, but does he know anything about the cable business? I'm not quite sure why they didn't go for one of the insiders. There were some strong people, I thought.""
Although C&amp;W's shares were languishing 2.5 pence lower at 485.5 pence in late afternoon trade, NYNEX CableComms saw its shares rise 5.5 pence to 108.5 pence.
With C&amp;W, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, planning to finalise the cable merger in spring, the lack of a chief executive at the new company had fuelled some speculation that a clash of cultures was hindering talks.
Although Brown conceded that the merger was complicated, he insisted: ""That is not true...There's a great deal of activity and we really are right on track.
""There is an exciting spirit of cooperation to bring this to reality,"" he said.
Brown, who will take the chair of the company, tipped to be worth 5.0 billion pounds ($8.36 billion), said a finance director would be the next announcement.
The proposed cable merger was announced last October -- and most such deals spell job cuts.
Although Brown said he was not legally allowed to comment ahead of Cable and Wireless Communications's planned listing in London and New York, he warned that the new group would ""clearly"" reap efficiencies.
""I cannot quantify what that is going to be, but we are working on that and we will achieve that,"" he said.
Cable and Wireless Communications, which will be well-placed to compete against dominant telecoms company British Telecommunications, will provide local, national and international data and mobile telecommunications with multi-channel television and Internet services.

24,"Orange Plc said on Monday its customers will be able to use their mobile phones to chat, transfer data and send faxes in Germany, France, Switzerland, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore by the end of 1997.
Announcing a roaming agreement with Swiss state-owned telecoms monopoly Swiss PTT, Orange Group technical and operations director Colin Tucker said he hoped customers would also soon be able to ""roam"" freely in Hong Kong and Scandinavia.
""I suppose the thing to say is, Watch this space,"" he told a news conference in Geneva.  
The introduction of digital equipment has helped fuel the battle to add value to the basic mobile telephone by allowing free roaming from country to country and far more reliable and secure connections.
Orange's 573,000 subscribers will be able to sign up for these enhanced services if they pass stringent credit checks and pay a 250 stg deposit to help curtail the fraud that has dogged similar previous agreements.
Orange already has a full roaming agreement in Germany and a partial one in France, centred on Paris. Talks are under way to add a number of European and Asian nations to the list.  
As with all roaming agreements, the financial details of the Swiss deal remain a trade secret. Initially, only subscribers in Geneva will be able to use Swiss PTT's Natel City network but Orange aims to boost coverage to Basel and Zurich by early 1997.
Orange says its offer of roaming services between the UK and other countries is part of its aim to provide customers with the best value for money. It notes that a significant proportion of users regularly use its established German services.
""Adding Geneva as another roaming service demonstrates our commitment to providing an international continuity of service,"" Tucker said.  
The system that Orange uses is much like that of market leaders Vodafone Group and British Telecom's 60 percent-owned Cellnet, in that they are based on the GSM (global system for mobile communications) sister technology called DCS-1800, which operates at 1800 MHz as opposed to 900 MHz.
Most of Cellnet's and Vodafone's subscribers are on the increasingly crowded analogue networks while Orange, along with rival Cable and Wireless- and U S West -owned Mercury One 2 One, is wholly digital.  
As mobile phone companies vie to lift the market out of its yuppie ghetto and into the mass market, the challenge for newcomers like Orange -- with its monthly rental packages that include free minutes and per-second charges -- is to attract customers who still have no mobile phone.
It also has to catch those as they move from the older analogue networks to the new digital technology. Orange, which last month reported gaping first-half pretax losses of 125.2 million stg, has seen its shares fall well short of the 205 pence level of its March flotation that valued the company at about 2.5 billion stg.
But the company, partly owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Wam Poa and British Aerospace, says its expects to turn in a profit or pay shareholders a dividend by 1998.

47,"Spirits, pubs and Dunkin' Donuts group Allied Domecq is likely to post a big drop in full-year profits on Tuesday, hit by a 320 million stg loss on the sale of its 50 percent stake in brewer Carlsberg-Tetley (C-T).
Before this exceptional charge, analysts' forecasts for pretax profits range from 560 to 581 million stg, down from 645 million last time, with most of the damage coming in Allied's spirits arm. Profits have been hit by the weak Mexican peso, tough trading conditions in the mature markets of Europe and America and de-stocking in the United States.  
The consensus forecast for the total dividend is 23.6p.
Allied sold its share in C-T to Bass in August for 200 million in cash together with its beer brands, allowing the group to quit brewing and concentrate entirely on its spirits and retailing businesses.
Allied said at the time it expected a loss on the sale of C-T of about 320 million stg.
After tax the company said it would mean a reduction in reserves of some 200 million stg.  
At Allied Domecq Spirits and Wines, many analysts are predicting a 60 million drop in trading profits from the 488 million stg recorded in 1995. Stock reduction and weak markets dented profits at the division in the first half, too.
In the United States where trade stocks of four major brands -- Kahlua, Beefeater, Courvoisier and Canadian Club -- built up last year, Allied was forced to start reducing stock levels by half a million cases which it expected to complete by the end of August 1996.
Some analysts think this de-stocking will strip 40 million stg off operating profits from the group's spirits arm.  
Trading profits from Allied's spirits and wine division dropped to 258 million stg for the six months ended February 29 from 327 million.
""Spirits will continue to show that things are tough although we are now seeing price increases of two to three percent coming in for the industry as a whole,"" said Mark Puleikis, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Allied's retailing division, which includes managed pubs as well as Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, is expected to post only a slight improvement in profits of some eight million to 223 million.  
""Although the managed pub side will improve, let's say it will add about about 12 million pounds to give 127 million at an operating level, Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins will drag the division down,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
In franchising, poor winter weather held back same-store sales growth particularly in Baskin-Robbins during the first half.
Carlsberg-Tetley is forecast to chip in trading profits of some 65 million at the year-end up from 61 million. In the six months to 29 February 1996 it made trading profits of 25 million, an increase of 14 percent on the same half last year.  
Attention will focus on what management has to say about continued pressure from the investment community for a demerger of Allied's spirits division.
Allied shares touched a five-month high of 492p on Friday. ""Obviously people are hoping there will be some news on a demerger,"" said one analyst who chose not to be named.
""A trading demerger would really add value to the group. The City has obviously done its sums and worked out it is worth about five pounds on a post-demerger basis,"" said another.
A Reuter poll of 24 brokers shows a consenus forecast for earnings per share of 33.7p rising to 37.4 next year.

47,"B.A.T Industries, reporting a nine percent rise in nine-month profits, on Wednesday ruled out a demerger of its tobacco business despite conceding that U.S. tobacco litigation was the main issue affecting its share price.
Chief executive Martin Broughton said the company did not see value in demerging the group into separate tobacco and financial services companies.
A strategy review showed ""there was no value we could see that would be generated from a demerger,"" he told Reuters.
Profits in the nine months rose to 2.04 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from 1.87 billion last time. Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.
Trading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.
Worldwide cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.
The growing pace of litigation claims against the company's U.S. cigarette subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson (B&amp;W), and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T's share price.
B.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to below 430 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company's stockmarket value along the way.
Broughton said a demerger of Brown &amp; Williamson would be ""highly destructive"" of shareholder value, adding there was ""no question"" that the board of directors was united on the issue.
He also played down fears over U.S. litigation. Only a few cases actually get to court although many are filed, and the company was confident of winning its appeal in the high-profile Carter case, Broughton told a meeting of company analysts.
In the case of Grady Carter, of Orange Park, Florida, a jury in Jacksonville ruled in August that B&amp;W was negligent and made a dangerous and defective product. Carter smoked for 50 years until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.
B.A.T shares have fallen sharply since the Florida court decided to award damages of $750,000 to Carter.
Lawyer Woody Wilner, who acted for Carter in the Florida case, had promised to bring one case a month, but three have been postponed until next year and one dismissed, B.A.T said.
B.A.T was also confident of blocking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's attempts to bring tobacco regulation into line with drugs and pharmaceuticals, said Broughton.
If the FDA proposals become law, cigarettes will be classified as ""medical devices"" and would have to meet rigorous safety and sales criteria.
Responding to a recent paper in the U.S Science Magazine which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, Broughton said B.A.T had no internal research which proved smoking caused lung cancer or that smoking was addictive.
""We have not concealed, we do not conceal and we will never conceal,"" he said. There was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking, he added.
Turning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and the African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.
In financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year. In Britain, the Eagle Star insurance division faced fiercely competitive conditions and profits fell to 162 million pounds from 194 million.
It also suffered a 91 million pounds charge for a surge in asbestos and pollution claims in the United States.
The life insurance and investment business reported a five percent increase in profit.
Shares in the company initially rose after the results, but later fell back to close at 427-1/2p pence, down 8-1/2p. ($1=.6223 Pound)
"
47,"Family controlled food and retailing group Associated British Foods reported a 15 percent increase in its full year profits on Monday, but chairman Garry Weston sounded a wary note when asked about the year ahead.
""I never play hostage to fortune. I've always been cautious,"" said Weston in an interview. ""It's a very bad time to forecast anything with two elections coming up -- in the United States and Britian. We have no idea how they will impact on us.""  
ABF posted pretax profits of 430 million pounds ($704.1 million) for the year ended September 14 whereas most stockmarket forecasts had centred on 415 million.
Worldwide sales were up 17 percent to 5.707 billion. Profits were driven by an especially strong performance from the company's retail operations in Britain and Ireland. Operating profits rose 25 percent to 69 million, with the company's supermarkets in Ireland further increasing their market share.
Primark, the women's textile chain, included results from One Up stores bought from Storehouse last year.  
""We got the fashion right. Primark has been refurbished and that improved its buying power and gave it more notice on the high street."" In the second half Primark was more in tune with public demand, said Weston.
ABF's food manufacturing and processing operations in Britain showed an 8.0 percent sales growth to 3.11 billion pounds and a 12 percent profits increase to 282 million.
However, operating profits from British Sugar fell to 183 million. British Sugar sales are limited by European community quotas and the renewed strength of the pound made imports from mainland Europe look cheaper in the second half.  
AFB's profits from its Australia and New Zealand operations increased by 20 percent to 38 million.
AC Humko, acquired from Kraft Foods in September 1995, chipped in its first full year of profits to ABF's north American business to help turn a 3.0 million loss in 1995 to a six million stg profit.
Analysts were surprised by the stronger than expected performance from ABF's milling and baking business where margins improved strongly. ABF owns the Twining group of companies, Burtons Biscuits, Allied Bakeries and an animal feed business.  
""They were good numbers a bit ahead of our figures, but it will be hard to match that in the current year,"" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon. ""The green pound rate is likely to mean a reduction in British Sugar profits and inflation in food prices looks very subdued,"" he said.
ABF shares rose 8p to 426p on the news.
Net cash held by the company rose by 196 million to 797 million at September 14, after spending 242 million on its assets and acquisitions during the year.
The company is keen to expand in the Far East and although ABF's history is one of expansion by organic growth if the oppurtunity arises it will make acquisitions, said Weston.
""We have been picking up acquisitions and if opportunities come along for something big then we will take it,"" he said.
During the year ABF acquired or formed businesses in Norway, Indonesia, China and the United States. ($1=.6107 Pound)

47,"Gareth Davies, chief executive of British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco, which de-merged from conglomerate Hanson in October, said on Thursday it was difficult to see growth in Britain, although it hoped to make this up by expansion in the Asia- Pacific region.
""In Britian it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world,"" he said.  
Earlier, Imperial posted profits of 303 million stg from Britain in the year ended September 28, unchanged from its 1995 level but profits from overseas grew 55 percent to 70 million.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of 15p on a packet of 20 cigarettes in his November Budget. After a similar rise in 1995, British cigarette sales fell by 2.5 percent to 81 billion.
Davies said he expected the same sort of fall again. He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe.
"
47,"Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, demerged from Hanson Plc in October, said on Thursday it's future was bright although British market growth was tough due to escalating taxes on cigarettes.
""In Britain it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world,"" chief executive Gareth Davis said in an interview.
Imperial posted trading profits of 303 million pounds ($491.8 million) from Britain in the year ended September 28, unchanged from its 1995 level, but profits from overseas grew 55 percent to 70 million.
Overall group profits before tax for the year were up five percent at 366 million pounds. The company's shares rose 5-1/2p to 373-1/2p.
Britain's Finance Minister, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of 15p on a packet of 20 cigarettes in his November 26 budget.
After a similar rise in 1995, British cigarette sales fell by 2.5 percent and Davis said he expected the same sort of fall again.
He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe.
The company's profits from overseas, which now make up 19 percent of total group profits, are targeted to reach 25 percent by the end of the decade, said Davis.
""I think we are in a world market which is still in growth, albeit modest, and Imperial is a relatively late entrant to international markets and has tremendous potential to exploit its brands internationally.""
In 1995, Imperial's set-up costs in emerging markets were about 9.0 million pounds before falling to around half that in 1996, said Davis, and its overseas investment is likely to remain at around that level each year until 2000.
He said the company was confident of its defence against 12 lawsuits bought in Britain by people who allege their health has been damaged by smoking its products.
""We have very strong defences and great confidence in those defences and we will defend each and any claim aganst us with the upmost vigour.""
One case involving 12 plaintiffs is the first in Britain where their lawyers, who have been denied legal aid, are working on a no win, no fee basis, a common practice in the United States. ($1=.6161 Pound)

47,"Shares in Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever Plc jumped on Friday after the group posted a better-than-expected five percent rise in third-quarter profits.
The company announced that profits rose to 826 million pounds ($1.4 billion) for the quarter, boosting the share price by 75p to 1,350 by the official close of the London market at 1630 GMT.
""I gritted myself for something rather unpleasant and its turned out very well,"" said David Lang, an analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
The results beat analysts' forecasts which ranged from 760 million pounds to 820 million.
""I think there is quite a lot of momentum in Unilever and that is before the benefits of management reorganisation which began in September,"" said Lang.
Before an exceptional charge of 32 million pounds, mostly to reshape Diversey, its newly acquired industrial cleaning business, pretax profits rose six percent to 918 million pounds.
""The total charges were clearly lower than we expected,"" said Richard Newboult, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. He had forecast a total restructuring charge of 74 million pounds with about half of that related to Diversey.
Diversey, acquired in January from Canadian brewer Molson for 360 million pounds, was merged with Lever Industrial in October to form a combined business with annual turnover of 1.15 billion pounds and a workforce of 13,000 in 60 countries.
Unilever owns a range of household brands including Persil and OMO washing detergents, Brooke Bond tea, Ponds cosmetic cream and Walls and Igloo frozen foods.
""Although poor weather had a negative effect on ice-cream sales, other parts of the business in Europe did well,"" said Unilever press officer Mike Haines.
Analysts and stock market dealers agreed. Despite the impact of a dull summer on ice-cream sales and profits, Unilever still managed to improve its profit by 13 million pounds to 502 million in the three month period from improved profits in detergents, frozen foods and personal products.
""The real strength came from the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia Pacific and the strong underlying performance in North America,"" added Haines.
The Asia-Pacific region turned in a 20 million pounds increase in profits to 108 million in the third quarter, Latin America was up 14 million pounds at 79 million, while Africa and the Middle East showed a nine million rise to 56 million pounds, reflecting changes made by the group to its Nigerian business.

47,"Larry Pillard, chief executive of British sugar and starch producer Tate and Lyle, said on Wednesday the company's beleagured North American unit Staley should benefit from improved market conditions this year.
""Conditions have reversed this year so that corn milling companies can divert some of their excess capacity into ethanol and that could tighten up the market a bit,"" he said.
Wet corn miller Staley posted a 50 percent fall in earnings because of a record increase in maize costs, dragging down group pretax profits for the year by some 35 million to 276.3 million.
"
47,"Drinks, food and retail group Grand Metropolitan Plc will post a strong rise in its underlying business performance in its full-year results on Thursday driven by its North American foods business Pillsbury, but it also stands to take a huge 522 million stg loss on disposals.
""The growth will really come through from Pillsbury, particularly on dough and pizza,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Colin Davies. Analysts forecasts for pretax profits range from 948 to 999.0 million stg, before the loss on disposals.  
GrandMet posted pre-tax profits of 920 million stg last year. Dividend forecasts are centred on 15.8p, up from 14.9p.
The loss on disposals is made up of 265 million stg of goodwill written off on the sale of its optician business Pearle, a 36 million stg hit on the disposal of William Hill and Mecca to leisure group Brent Walker and a 14 million stg loss on the disposal of its Erasco food business in Germany, to the Campbell Soup Company.
At the time of the Erasco sale GrandMet said it would take a further 207 million stg of goodwill written off on the sale of a batch of European foods businesses.  
The sell-off is designed to enable GrandMet to focus in Europe on its major international brands - Pillsbury,  Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs and Old El Paso.
Aside from the exceptional charges analysts see a 26 percent profit improvement from GrandMet's food business to an estimated 456 million stg.
Pillsbury has achieved prices rises and gained market share since the first half, GrandMet said in September.  
Analysts expect Pillsbury to contribute about 274 million stg of the estimated 456 million while Pet, producer of Old El Paso and Italian foods and soups acquired in January 1995 for some 2.0 billion stg, is expected to chip in about 160 million.
Sector analysts also anticipate a near 15 million stg improvement in profits to 470 million from the company's spirits arm International Distillers and Vintners (IDV). ""We expect GrandMet's drinks business to do better than either Allied Domecq or Guinness,"" said Merrill Lynch, analyst Mark Puleikis.  
""They have been a lot more proactive and aggressive in their advertising expenditure over the last two years and they are more exposed to the vodka category which is standing them in good stead,"" he said.

47,"Britain's largest brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle Plc will see more benefit from its Courage brands in its half year results due on Monday, but its holiday village business Center Parcs will hold it back, analysts said.
""The company will see an improvement from a full contribution at Courage, but what is really holding it back is Center Parcs and there could be a worry on the currency with the recent strength in the pound,"" said Nikko analyst Dermott Carr.
Analysts forecasts for pretax profits range from 178 to 198 million stg up from 154.5 million last time.  
Dividend forecasts centre on 7.0p. Brewing is expected to contribute some 80 million stg, with 45 million of this total anticipated from Courage. Courage made just 9.0 million stg in operating profit, on turnover of 298.9 million stg, to overall group profits in the first half of 1995.
S&amp;N acquired Courage from Australian brewer Foster's in August, 1995 to create Britain's largest brewing group in a deal that cost about 550 million stg. Since then S&amp;N has quickly set about reducing its brewing capacity by some 1.5 million barrels a year, initially by closing two breweries and shedding some 1,600 jobs.  
John Smith's Courage is now Britain's leading ale brand.
The group's Center Parcs holiday resorts are expected to suffer from continued weak consumer leisure spending in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Center Parcs made operating profit of 82.0 million stg in the year to April 28, 1995 down 2.1 percent on turnover of 365.3 million. S&amp;N's new village at Bispinger Heide in Germany was opened against a very weak economic background in July 1995 and the cost of opening was higher than the company expected.  
Pontin's, S&amp;N's other leisure brand, made trading profits of 3.6 million, down from 4.1 million due to the sale of four sites and major refurbishment work at two others.
The performance of its Center Parc villages in the Netherlands and Belgium were adversely affected by a lack of consumer confidence and cut price competition from operators and it responded by investing heavily in those countries.
Analysts expect this trend to have carried on into the first half of the year, forcing the leisure division to report profits down some 5.0 million at 45 million.  
The company has three Center Parcs in Britain at Nottingham in the Midlands, East Anglia and Longleat, in the west of England. It owns two in France, one in Germany, two in Belgium and six in Holland.
However, S&amp;N's retail division, which includes the 1,600 strong chain of Chef &amp; Brewer restaurants, should see trading profits improve by increased investment aimed at rebranding and lifting the image of some outlets.
The company's managed pub estate has been rebranded to include pub-cafe bars like Rat &amp; Parrot and entertainment pubs like Big Hand Mo.  
The consensus of analysts forecasts for profits from the retail division rests at 88 million stg, up some 8.0 million on the first half of 1995. The division includes an estate of 740 tenanted and about 1,850 managed pubs as well as Chef &amp; Brewer.
The company's shares have outperformed its peers by about eight percent since February, but started underperforming the FTSE100 index by some six percent since late September.
The shares were up 142p at 642 on Friday from their 500p close on January 3. Return on equity is currently running at 5.62 percent, half its 11.32 percent level in 1995, against 10.44 percent currently for Bass.  
Operating margins have fallen to 12.27 percent from 15.46 percent in 1995.
A Reuter poll of 23 brokers estimates produced a consensus estimate EPS of 44.8 for the year ended April 28, 1997 rising to 49.5 for year end 1998.

13,"Jailed, sentenced to labour camps, cowed or exiled, China's pro-democracy activists have virtually vanished.
The latest dissident to be swallowed by China's gulag was prominent literary critic Liu Xiaobo, sentenced on Tuesday to three years in a labour camp. Veteran democracy activist Wang Xizhe has simply disappeared.
Any hopes among Chinese dissidents of a revival of their beleaguered movement may lie with the Nobel Committee in Oslo and whether it decides on Friday to select Nobel Peace Prize nominee and veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng.
However, few in China expect Wei, regarded as the father of China's struggling democracy movement and serving the first year of a 14-year jail term, to win the Nobel Peace Prize and thus halt the slow demise of Chinese dissent.
Members of Wei's family said they did not consider him a serious contender because of the strength of competition from front runners such as Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. architect of Bosnia's peace treaty, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang voiced outrage at the suggestion on Thursday.
""I have already stressed many times that Wei Jingsheng is a criminal who has broken Chinese law. This kind of criminal basically has no qualifications to win any prize,"" he said.
Wei was jailed for 15 years for his role in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement when he wrote an article that called for democracy as China's ""Fifth Modernisation"" and attacked paramount leader Deng Xiaoping as a dictator.
He was released on parole in September 1993 after serving 14-1/2 years and re-arrested the following April. He was sentenced to 14 years last December for plotting to subvert the government.
""Would it make a great deal of difference?"" said one Western diplomat when asked about the impact if Wei were to win the Nobel Peace Prize. ""It wouldn't get him out any quicker. It would turn the international spotlight on China for a little while but that of itself would not be enough to get the (democracy) movement going again.""
Diplomats have expressed surprise at the rash of arrests and convictions of dissidents -- many of them sentenced to the administrative punishment of ""re-education through labour"" that avoids a complicated trial process.
""My feeling had been that the whole business was under control,"" the diplomat said. ""There are a few who pop up and engage in experiments to annoy the authorities but they are nothing serious or threatening to the regime.""
He attributed the new crackdown to a secret plenum of the Communist Party, expected to finish later on Thursday with a statement on the importance of ""spiritual civilisation"" -- or conformity to orthodox Marxist values.
""Everyone will be expected to think properly and so they may need to tidy up a remaining few loose ends,"" the diplomat said.
Liu Xiaobo, who gained fame during the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement, was ordered to serve three years in a labour camp, a term imposed just hours after police detained him during a raid on his Beijing home.
Veteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe, who recently joined Liu in a statement calling for the impeachment of President and party chief Jiang Zemin, had disappeared from his home in southern Guangzhou, his wife said.
On Thursday court officials told the family of Wang Dan, a detained dissident and leader of the 1989 student protests, to hire a lawyer on his behalf, his mother said. The Beijing People's Intermediate Court informed her that she had until Friday to find a lawyer, in a sign that his trial was imminent.
""They have had so many crackdowns in the past that most figures are under lock and key or safely out of the way abroad, and in either case pretty harmless,"" the diplomat said.

13,"China's economic growth is likely to accelerate in 1997 as Beijing pumps up its economy before a crucial Communist Party congress that may tackle nagging reform problems, state media said.
Political factors were likely to be a significant factor in a possible renewed boom next year in one of the world's fastest growing economies, the China Daily Business Weekly quoted Xu Hongyuan of the State Information Centre as saying on Sunday.
However, Xu also warned that the higher growth could see the spin-off of a renewed burst of inflation and warned of rising joblessness, giving one of the most pessimistic unemployment forecasts to be published openly in China.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997 could reach 8,178 billion yuan ($985 billion), growing by 10.5 percent compared with an anticipated 9.6-9.7 percent increase this year, the newspaper quoted Xu as saying.
GDP grew by 10.2 percent in 1995 and Beijing's communist rulers have been trying to cool the rate slightly amid signs the economy was threatening to overheat. China has set a goal of eight percent average growth for the 1996-2000 Ninth Five-Year Plan.
Xu linked his higher growth forecast to the five-yearly Communist Party congress, set for late in 1997, which he said was expected to take some difficult decisions to eradicate the low economic efficiency and operational losses plaguing thousands of lumbering state enterprises.
""These political factors, if the government makes use of them smoothly, will provide strong backing to national economic performance in 1997,"" the newspaper said, quoting Xu.
Diplomats and western economists have said Beijing may try to revive an economic boom in 1997 in the run-up to the party congress as part of a push to bolster the standing of the current leadership before a meeting when personnel reshuffles are a key issue.
Xu forecast retail price inflation to speed up slightly in 1997 to about eight percent from an expected seven percent this year. Inflation was 14.8 percent last year, down from a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
Official media have been rife with speculation that China may again trim interest rates after two cuts already this year but central bank officials insist Beijing has no plans to do anything more than ""appropriately"" adjust a three-year-old tight monetary policy.
Xu said foreign trade was expected to make a strong recovery after exports slumped in the first few months of this year, especially as the government completes repayment of billions of dollars of export rebates to exporters.
He forecast exports to reach $171.5 billion in 1997, up 14.1 percent from 1996.
Xu urged a further cut in import tariffs next year, a move that Beijing has promised and which could lubricate China's bid to gain entry to the World Trade Organisation.
However, Xu forecast a sharp increase in unemployment.
In 1997, the number of people out of work in the urban area could be as many as eight million, including workers left idle because of suspension of factory production, he said.
The urban jobless rate could reach eight percent next year if both surplus workers at factories and registered unemployed were included, Xu said.
China's official registered urban jobless rate was 2.98 percent at the end of September.

13,"China's Communist Party, in what it called one of its greatest ever documents, warned on Sunday against hostile Western ideas such as parliamentary democracy and capitalism and vowed to fight back with puritan Marxist values.
The 15,000-character document -- adopted at last week's annual secret plenum of the ruling party elite -- marked the latest volley by party chief Jiang Zemin to boost his position by battling corruption, pornography and worship of money while promoting nationalism and hardline communist ideology.
Diplomats said a strong tone of opposition to the West and particularly the United States, which Beijing fears is pursuing a policy of containment toward China, also suffused the document, unveiled by the official Xinhua news agency.
They said Jiang was striving to placate leftwing party hardliners angered by what they see as an erosion of puritan communist values by nearly two decades of profit-based economic reform.
""The standard of moral conduct has been lowered in some spheres, and the practice of worshipping money, seeking pleasure and individualism has grown,"" the document said.
It railed against corruption, warning senior party officials not to be tempted by the lures of power, profit and sex.
Jiang has warned repeatedly that corruption is a virus that could topple the party which has ruled China since 1949, and public opinion surveys show graft as the top popular gripe.
In a sign that Jiang needs to consolidate his power base even after amassing China's three most important posts -- general secretary of the party, state president and chairman of the party's powerful Central Military Commission -- the document paid extravagant homage to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, 92.
The text was littered with 14 mentions of Deng's name, against just three for Jiang and four for the late Chairman Mao Zedong.
Analysts say Jiang remains overshadowed by Deng, architect of the market-oriented reforms and influential even without an official post and despite increasingly fragile health.
However, a recurring theme of the document was a warning to the nation to be on guard against the West, taking up one of the main platforms of Jiang's rule -- the importance of patriotism.
It urged self-sufficiency, saying people should ""fear no pressure, safeguard national sovereignty and surmount sanctions imposed by Western countries"" -- a clear reference to the United States.
""Because socialism has suffered serious setbacks on a worldwide scale, pressure from the superiority of developed capitalist countries in economy...as well as the infiltrations of Western ideology will remain for a long time,"" it warned.
It advocated ""how to...prevent and eliminate the spread of cultural garbage, resist the conspiracy by hostile forces to westernise and split our country,"" -- and suggested more flag-raising ceremonies and singing of the national anthem.
However, despite the lip-service to Deng Xiaoping, the document cast doubt over one of his most far-reaching reforms -- the lifting of a ban on private enterprise -- while repeating his opposition to western-style democracy.
""It is necessary to distinguish right from wrong on such major issues as...common development of various economic sectors with socialist public ownership as the mainstay versus privatisation...socialist democracy versus parliamentary democracy practised in Western countries,"" it said.
""Liberalism will precisely lead China to the capitalist road and undermine the political situation,"" the document thundered.
"
13,"The largest bomb blast reported in Tibet marks a new desperation in anti-Chinese sentiment in the restive region and offers a longed-for opportunity to officials to launch a new crackdown, analysts said on Monday.
""I think what we are seeing here is people who tend to say that the path of non-violence is not working and they will now use violence,"" Robbie Barnett of the London-based Tibet Information Network said in a telephone interview.
The Himalayan region that is peopled mainly by deeply devout Buddhists has been rocked in recent years by sporadic, sometimes violent, anti-Chinese unrest, with monks and nuns often at the forefront of demonstrations for independence.
The home-made ammonium nitrate blast early on Christmas Day outside a city government office in Lhasa shattered windows in a radius of 100 metres (yards) and was the largest such explosion reported in the region. No casualties were reported.
Barnett described the attack as an act of desperation.
""These people are Buddhists,"" Barnett said. ""But they are Buddhists who do not see anything being achieved by what the Dalai Lama is doing and they are very worried about it.""
Officials said there was little doubt that the Christmas Day blast in Lhasa was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the region's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
""There have been increasing hints that some groups could turn to violence if China did not relax its repression in Tibet,"" Barnett said. ""But this movement seems to have attracted only a very few.""
The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland, says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in Tibet.
He fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule and has since lived in India with many followers.
As part of his peaceful campaign, the Dalai has proposed talks with Beijing, suggesting China shoulder defence and foreign policy but allow Tibetans self-rule in internal matters such as religion. His spokesmen say China has not responded.
Beijing has said it cannot negotiate unless the Dalai Lama recognises Chinese sovereignty.
Analysts said the latest bombing had played into the hands of local authorities eager for evidence that would demonstrate to Beijing the need for a stricter crackdown in Tibet.
""This is just the kind of thing the authorities in Tibet have been hoping for,"" Barnett said.
""They have been exaggerating hugely the extent of unrest to justify the need for a crackdown,"" he said, referring to a string of Tibet newspaper articles warning against anti-Chinese forces. ""This can only help them.""
Officials interviewed recently in Tibet played down the extent of anti-Chinese feeling in the region, saying those opposed to Beijing were a tiny minority. Witnesses saw little sign of tight security in the capital, Lhasa.
However, a senior police official in Lhasa hinted on Monday that a stable security situation in Tibet and its temples was a result of careful planning. ""The order in monasteries is good because we have recently regulated them,"" he said.
An ideological campaign in Tibet, as elsewhere in China, to promote socialist ethics and allegiance to the Communist Party could have ignited the new violence in a region where many ordinary Tibetans pledge their first loyalty to religion, Barnett said.
"
13,"China hailed on Tuesday its war on bourgeois decadence as the top news event of 1996 along with missile tests off Taiwan, but ignored improved ties with the United States and the jailing of a dozen dissidents.
The line-up of the top 10 news events in China in 1996 as selected by senior editors of the major Communist Party-linked newspapers closely reflected the party line on news -- or propaganda.
The list issued by the Xinhua news agency differed sharply from events in China that have focused international eyes on the world's most populous country in the last 12 months.
Heading the list selected by 12 Beijing editors was the annual plenum of China's ruling Communist Party in October that adopted a 15,000-word document exhorting China's 1.2 billion people to adhere to socialist ethics and abhor bourgeois Western liberalism.
On Christmas Eve, it was unclear how far socialist values extended, but Santa Claus appeared to be exempt as he smiled and waved from dozens of Beijing and Shanghai department stores.
Politics, not only news value, may have coloured the views of many of the editors, who would have remembered that the plenum was trumpeted as one of the major achievements of Communist Party chief, state President and army boss Jiang Zemin -- anointed heir to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Newspaper editors elsewhere in the world would probably have chosen Beijing's campaign to intimidate Taiwan in the run-up the island's first popular elections of a Chinese president on Chinese soil as the top story of 1996.
However, for Chinese editors the decision to conduct missile tests and live-fire war games in waters near the island last March, and which sent U.S. aircraft carriers steaming into neighbouring seas, ranked only fourth in their top 10.
The news item in second place related to China's resumption of sovereignty over the British colony of Hong Kong in mid-1997, or Premier Li Peng's decision to sign off on the appointment of shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive.
Other editors might have focused less on the role of a single Chinese leader in Tung's elevation and more on his selection by a Beijing-sponsored committee of his peers.
Four of the top 10 Chinese news stories were linked to economic achievements and one to sports -- the Atlanta Olympic Games in which China ranked fourth overall in the medals' tally. Just two involved international affairs.
President Jiang's visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines last month edged into fifth place.
Jiang's APEC meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton set the seal on a warming of frosty Sino-U.S. ties and resulted in a decision on an exchange of the first presidential state visits in nearly eight years. But for China's news commissars, that merited only a brief aside.
""Chinese President Jiang Zemin... met with leaders of other APEC members, including U.S. President Clinton,"" Xinhua said.
China's renewed crackdown on dissent, such as its decision to sentence Wang Dan, a former leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, to 11 years in jail for conspiring to subvert the government, went unmentioned.
"
13,"China must tackle the thorny task of state enterprise reform this year, forcing through unpopular layoffs and bankruptcies to halt haemorrhaging losses, economic tsar Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said on Thursday.
Zhu hailed such achievements in 1996 as a high economic growth rate of 9.7 percent, a fall in inflation to 6.0 percent and the swelling of foreign exchange reserves to a record $105 billion at the year-end.
However, he cited two urgent tasks that must be tackled in 1997 -- increasing grain reserves and ensuring incentives to farmers and halting rapidly mounting losses among the state enterprises that form the backbone of China's economy.
About 75 percent of China's more than 100,000 state firms lost money last year and total losses in the government sector soared to 69 billion yuan ($8.3 billion) between January and October, a year-on-year rise of 45 percent.
Zhu blamed the losses on two increases in state prices for farm products, hikes in costs of transport and power, tighter accounting mechanisms, high interest rate payments despite two cuts last year and arbitrary fees by local governments.
However, these were secondary reasons, Zhu told a meeting in Beijing on re-employment in state enterprises.
The three main reasons were duplication of products, the impact of widespread smuggling and the burden of huge numbers of surplus workers employed in state firms, Zhu said.
Many state firms, accustomed to mass-production for a command economy, have struggled to adjust to China's new consumer-led markets and continue to churn out millions of yuan worth of unsaleable goods.
Tackling these problems must be a priority in 1997, he said, if China is to turn around inefficient state enterprises that recorded their first net loss in the first quarter of last year as they struggled in an economy racing to abandon the cushion of central planning in favour of a sink-or-swim marketplace.
Zhu called for reorganising management in state enterprises this year, citing bad management as a major factor in growing losses, and urged active promotion of re-employment projects to help surplus workers or those laid off through streamlining.
He also urged standardisation of the bankruptcy system, which has been used mainly on an experimental basis for the past few years, along with encouragement of mergers.
While proposing the use of mergers rather than bankruptcy to eliminate loss-making state firms, he advised against the sale of an entire company and favoured enterprises taking on a portion of the ailing firm's debt.
The government would write off up to 30 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) of bad debt this year, and this figure could rise gradually in the next few years, Zhu said.
On agriculture, Zhu revealed for the first time the size of China's state grain reserves, which totalled a record 148.5 million tonnes at the end of 1996. That marked an increase of 34.4 million tonnes compared with the end of 1995, he said.
China has estimated its 1996 grain harvest at a record 480 million tonnes, up from a record 466 million tonnes in 1995.
Market prices for grain would not fall and Zhu urged farmers not to sell their grain at low prices to private traders.
Beijing is anxious that farmers continue to grow grain and not turn to more lucrative cash crops and wants to insure that farm incomes do not drop with the record harvests.
"
13,"China will accelerate listings of new firms on its two stock markets next year to meet demand and curb speculation, a senior securities official said.
His remarks, published on Sunday, came a week after an official statement warned investors away from excessive speculation, triggering a steep sell-off on the Shanghai and southern Shenzhen stock exchanges.
However, an official of the top securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, sounded another note of caution, saying that the markets needed even tighter regulation because of insider trading, excessive speculation and trading on margin.
""It will remain at the top of our work agenda for a fairly long period of time to further supervise the stock market, and curb over-speculation and irregularities ... to better protect the interests of the smaller investors,"" Xinhua quoted the unidentified official as saying.
Since the People's Daily editorial one week ago, Shanghai's domestic A share index has tumbled 20.07 percent, standing at 922.34 points last Friday compared with 1,163.05 at the close a week before.
The foreign currency B index fell 3.84 percent to 63.743 points from 66.291 points a week ago after a roller-coaster five days of trading.
China would move more swiftly to list additional firms on the markets, in line with the recent market upswings, Xinhua quoted Zhang Dongsheng, a deputy director of the Finance and Banking Department of the State Planning Commission, as saying.
""This is part of the nation's effort to balance supply and demand in the stock market and curb excessive speculation,"" Zhang said.
Last week China announced a share quota of 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) for 1996 and to be carried over into 1997, almost double the 5.5 billion yuan approved for the previous year.
Analysts said one aim of the decision to flood the fledgling stock markets with new issues was to soak up excess funds that have fuelled a flurry of speculation in recent months.
At its height just a few days ago, Shanghai's domestic A share index had surged more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart over 300 percent since April, when Beijing announced that it supported development of the stock markets.
In a sign of soaring interest in securities, official figures show 21 million Chinese have now opened trading accounts, up from just 12 million at the start of the year and rocketing from 14 million in September, Xinhua said.
The rapidly growing number of stock investors had caused the market to overheat on a shortage of supply, resulting in runaway price rises and excessive speculation, Xinhua said.
""The current market size allows some institutional investors to manipulate the stock prices and drive them up to ridiculous highs,"" it quoted Cao Fengqi, a financial expert at prestigious Beijing University, as saying.
""An accelerated expansion of the Chinese stock market will boost the capital market and help pool more funds for capital-strapped enterprises,"" he said.
Speculation could be curbed only if the market was big enough to handle demand, he added.
Beijing, which says its stock exchanges and futures markets are experiments, was committed to the markets, Xinhua said.
Current market capitalisation of more than 1.33 trillion yuan, almost triple the 1995 figure, accounts for 18 percent of China's gross domestic product, compared with six percent at the end of last year, Xinhua added. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)

13,"Days and nights of intense talks on ways to liberalise global trade brought ministers to the brink of agreement on Wednesday although the stormy issue of labour rights cast a shadow on a final deal.
Despite sleepless nights and three days of intense negotiations, World Trade Organisation (WTO) Director-General Renato Ruggiero was buoyant at the inaugural Ministerial Conference of the two-year-old watchdog body.
""I am very encouraged. The sense of achievement is very clear,"" he told Reuters as he emerged at the half-way stage of the gathering from the latest of several sessions aimed at finalising a declaration for the ministers to sign.
""The road is open to something important, something big,"" declared Ruggiero, whose horizon has been set on the Singapore meeting since he took up the post 18 months ago just after the body was launched.
""We are deep in negotiation, and I do not want to prejudice anything,"" he said. ""But there have been some very interesting proposals to get over some of the differences. People are ready for compromise to reach agreement.""
Haggling in Singapore focuses on a multi-billion dollar Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and wording of the last few contentious clauses in a final declaration to try to include the concerns of all of the organisation's 128 members.
The document is intended as a blueprint consolidating agreements already reached in the 1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade talks -- in areas ranging from goods tariffs and services to farm produce and textiles.
It will also set the course and the tone for discussions between now and the end of the century on topics not yet fully under the WTO purview such as basic telecommunications, financial and maritime services, and many others.
The big battle has been over whether to include a reference to core labour standards in the document and whether it should include provision for some discussion in the WTO on investment rules, competition policies and the way national authorities award contracts -- or government procurement.
Several countries, mostly Asian, are resisting what they see as a U.S.-driven push to get labour rights on to the WTO agenda and to use the organisation's disputes court to erode the developing world's low-cost labour edge.
When asked if Malaysia would permit a WTO study on labour rights, International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters: ""No, no, no way. There is no place for labour issues at the WTO.""
The United States, backed by France, Norway and the International Confederation of Free Trades Unions (ICFTU), has been pressing hard for inclusion of the issue in the final text.
Delegates say Washington has insisted the issue be included if it is to back the declaration when the conference ends.
The United States, digging in its heels, says the labour issue involves human rights, eliminating developing world sweat shops, child and forced labour and other forms of worker abuse.
Faster progress was expected on ITA, with delegates scrambling for an accord to free trade in the $600 billion market for computers, software chips and other high-technology products by the year 2000.
Negotiators from the Big Four powers, the United States, Japan, the European Union and Canada haggled in meetings on the sidelines to try to settle differences as early as late on Wednesday on such touchy questions as what products would be covered and the extent of tariff reductions.
""There is not an agreement yet,"" European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said after meeting Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
""There is agreement on many points. There are some outstanding ones. We are trying to resolve those.""
A Japanese government source told Reuters earlier that gaps still remained among the Big Four powers, particularly over which products to include.
""We are continuing to work with our Quad (Big Four) partners and with many other delegates to find a formula that will succeed,"" a U.S. official told reporters.
Washington hopes that in addition to a broad infotech pact by as many countries as possible, the WTO will endorse the ITA deal in its Ministerial Declaration on Friday.
That would allow WTO members unable to sign on now to do so at a later date by presenting revised tariff schedules at the WTO in Geneva, the U.S. official said.
"
13,"Top Hollywood film stars, including screen idols Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, have been placed on a blacklist of 50 people barred from visiting the restive region of Tibet, Chinese officials said on Friday.
News that some of Hollywood's biggest box office draws were on a blacklist comes just weeks after Beijing clashed with U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney Co over its film on the life of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford and his wife Melissa Mathison Ford as well as directors Martin Scorsese and Jean-Jaques Annaud were among a group of movie personalities on a blacklist held by the Tibet Tourism Bureau, a tourist official said by telephone from the regional capital, Lhasa.
""Last October, we were verbally informed by the Tibet state security office that those foreigners should not be given an entry permit if they applied to visit Tibet,"" he said.
""At the end of April or in early May, we received the formal documents,"" he said, when asked if the Hollywood stars were barred from the Himalayan region that has been rocked by sporadic anti-Chinese unrest in recent years.
""They are banned from coming here for any reason,"" the official said, adding that none of those named on the list had yet applied to visit.
Brad Pitt stars as an escaped Austrian prisoner of war, who fled India in World War Two and found refuge in Lhasa where he befriended the young Dalai Lama, in the film ""Seven Years in Tibet"" that is directed by Annaud. China has not formally objected to the film.
However, it has apparently tried to halt production by California-based Walt Disney of the film ""Kundun"" that tells of the Dalai Lama's early life and is directed by Scorsese. Mathison Ford is a scriptwriter for the movie.
Disney has said it will go ahead with the release of ""Kundun"" despite China's objections. Beijing has denied putting pressure on Disney to withdraw backing for the film.
Beijing has been reported to have warned Walt Disney last month that its ambitious business plans in China were at risk if it went ahead with the release of the movie.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Disney would be wrong to sing the praises of the exiled spiritual leader.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and has since waged a non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.
However, the blacklist did not include actor Richard Gere, who has long backed the Tibetan spiritual movement and is an active supporter of the Dalai Lama, the tourism official said.
Gere was among a group of movie luminaries who this month wrote to China's ambassador in Washington protesting against what they called Beijing's ""attempt to impose worldwide censorship"".
Officials had begun to compile a blacklist of foreigners barred from visiting the restive area in 1993, and the list had now reached more than 50 names, he said.
All foreign visitors to Tibet are required first to obtain an entry permit issued by local authorities who are anxious to keep out Westerners who may support the underground pro-independence movement spearheaded by the region's monks.
"
13,"China is dipping its toe into the freedoms of Hong Kong but is finding the water chilly -- and Beijing's latest pronouncement on freedom of expression under Chinese rule may be giving it cold feet, analysts said on Friday.
China's communist rulers are so accustomed to exercising power that is scarcely checked by law, they may be having difficulty curbing their tongues when it comes to the delicate handover of Hong Kong, diplomats said on Friday.
One example came on Thursday when China tried to backtrack from a warning by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Hong Kong people on limits to their freedom of expression after the territory reverts to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997.
""Chinese officials seem to be speaking from the heart when it comes to Hong Kong and then realise that they have put their foot in their mouth where the law is concerned,"" said one Western analyst.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang raced on Thursday to repair damage from his boss's remarks, saying: ""Hong Kong people will have full freedom of expression, but all freedoms must be within the limits allowed by law.""
His statement followed an interview with Foreign Minister Qian by the Asian Wall Street Journal,in which Qian hinted that Hong Kong would no longer be able to mark the anniversary of Beijing's June 4, 1989, crackdown on student-led protests.
Qian's interview stirred an outcry in Hong Kong, where China has pledged a high degree of political freedoms for 50 years after the handover on July 1, 1997, and not to change its capitalist system.
But Shen's damage control may have been too late.
Western diplomats said Qian's remarks gave great cause for concern and were almost certain to stir anxiety in Hong Kong.
""Ordinary Hong Kong people have fairly mixed feelings,"" said one Western diplomat. ""There is an element of patriotism about their return to the mainland but they don't want their basic freedoms to be put in question.""
Chinese officials said Foreign Minister Qian was believed to have shown great interest in the response in Hong Kong to his remarks on the limits on what Hong Kong's people could do after the 1997 handover.
Qian was reported to have showed little surprise at the reaction in Hong Kong, and had paid close attention to the stir in the territory, one official said.
""It looks as if he may have gone a little beyond what he should have said,"" said another Western diplomat. ""But he clearly thought he was safe in saying that and now they are trying to smooth over the rough edges.""
Hong Kong newspaper reports that interpreted Qian's remarks as a ban on activities in the territory to commemorate the 1989 crackdown were wrong, Shen said, adding that Beijing had not altered its pledge to maintain Hong Kong's current political and economic system under Chinese sovereignty.
A transcript of Qian's interview showed he was specifically asked what activities would not be allowed and whether the 1989 commemoration was among them. Qian replied that he was referring to just such activities.
""This isn't the first time this kind of faux pas has happened,"" one diplomat said, referring to similar remarks this year on post-1997 freedom limitations by Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under China's State Council, or cabinet.
""I don't expect that it will be the last.""

14,"A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:
Journalist: ""Could you please tell me Mr. Novak's first name.""
Secretary (with no hesitation): ""Doctor.""
Czechs are obsessed with academic titles.
It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained ""Doctor of Law"" which forced him to resign from cabinet on Tuesday in a shocking mea culpa on the floor of parliament.
""In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,"" Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute, said.
Normal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as ""Mr. Engineer"" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or ""Mr. Doctor"", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers to PhD'd journalists.
Kalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.
His resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised ""JUDr"" moniker in campaign material and biographies.
Apart from Kalvoda, only one resigned from parliament, the three others so far have refused.
""I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,"" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of ""Dr."" for this story.
The Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title -- Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD) -- but he does not inisist on its use by others.
Some of title-envy stems from four decades of communism which ended with 1989's bloodless ""Velvet Revolution"" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.
Communist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.
Kalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.
The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml - a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.
The daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.
Havel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and never was allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.
""He made himself a name, not a title,"" Lidove Noviny wrote.

14,"The Czech Agriculture Ministry on Friday halted a shipment of U.S. maize thought to contain genetically-manipulated strains, pending further study on its effects.
Until the study is finished no maize from the shipment will be distributed in the Czech Republic, it added.
Frantisek Havir of the ministry's agriculture production section said the Institute for Agricultural Production would conduct the study as soon as possible.
""The state Veterinary Administration is halting the shipment of maize...until it is decided whether these genes can pass into the food chain,"" Havir said.
On Thursday, protestors in Hamburg disrupted loading of the shipment, chaining themselves to the trains bound for the Czech Republic, where laws regulating how genetically manipulated products should be treated do not exist.
The exact location of the 33,000 tonne shipment was unknown, but the Czech chapter of Greenpeace carried on with the protest on Friday, with five demonstrators dressing up as laboratory rabbits.
""Today, the issue is that there is a precedent being made. There is no legislation in the Czech Republic regulating dealing with genetically-modified materials,"" said Vaclav Masku of Greenpeace.
The protests are the latest of several blockades in Europe in recent weeks aimed a halting the import of genetically altered soybeans, and now maize.
It is illegal to market such modified maize in the EU, though Greenpeace says cargoes may have already reached Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
An EU Commission is due to decide on December 18 whether to allow imports of such modified maize, made in the U.S. under licence by Swiss chemicals company Ciba  CIGZsn.S Geigy AG.
U.S. exporters do not separate the maize, estimated to amount to 0.6 percent of their crop, from conventional maize.
Havir, who met Greenpeace protestors before the news conference, said the Czechs would cooperate with the EU in any way possible, in addition to conducting its own study.
But he added: ""Genetically-modified commodities do not have to be dangerous. Their usage is a great advance in agriculture.""

14,"The party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus pulled ahead in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at just 35 percent, the real winner was apathy.
In what was billed as a key test of Klaus's minority coalition government, candidates of his centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) topped voting in 66 of the 71 constituencies declared by mid-evening.
But most face a second round run-off on November 22-23 for the newly-created upper house, and analysts said the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans, who boycotted the elections and told fellow Czechs to do likewise.
Nationwide figures were not available. But the Central Election Commission said turnout in 53 of the 81 constituencies had been just 34.27 percent.
This was far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections held in June.
Klaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance following his electoral disaster last June, when strong Social Democrat gains stripped his three-party coalition of its lower house majority.
""From the results so far it is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability,"" he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate which has stalled reform since the inconclusive lower house polls.
""These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal,"" he said.
Under the Senate rules, candidates who fail to win over half the first round vote have to face the runner-up in a second round. Most constituencies will be decided next weekend.
But already it appears the Social Democrats of economist Milos Zeman have done badly, failing to come out on top in a single constituency.
Zeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.
But he added: ""I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates.""
In the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running.
Sladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent rally.
Polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.
Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate, Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority, although he denies that.
But ODS is better at mobilising support than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.
""If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country,"" said Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI).
"
14,"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky on Friday said the central bank was committed to keeping the crown strong, despite some calls to devalue the appreciating currency to help exports.
Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and top business executives, Tosovsky said the central bank would keep the crown within the current band within which it fixes the currency daily against a mark/dollar basket.
""I said that we will try to keep the rate within the plus/minus 7.5 percent band (agains the mark/dollar cross rate),"" Tosovsky told reporters.
""I dismissed speculation that we would want to move the crown in some way outside the band,"" he added.
Analysts recently have been debating whether a devaluation of the crown might be needed to boost exports and help stem a ballooning current account deficit.
The trade deficit is threatening to send the current account shortfall to close to six percent of gross domestic product this year after about four percent last year.
Some have argued that a devaluation is still required to help the country's goods to remain competitive while wages are rising and the economy is still transforming.
But others have said that the foreign capital inflow is still comfortably paying for the imports, and the current account deficit is still not dangerous.
Tosovsky said a stable crown had served its purpose in regulating the country's inflation, and a stronger crown would have positive effects on reforming Czech industry to make it more competitive.
He said a stronger crown ""should help faster restructuring of our economy, to help increase the added-value faster...and to help to bring our country closer in productivity to the countries that we want to compare ourselves with.""
The latter was a clear reference to the European Union and especially neighbouring Germany.
The central bank fixes the crown daily within a band plus or minus 7.5 percent from the central parity of the mark/crown basket.
It has been fixing it recently at more than three percent above parity to match a modest net inflow from foreign crown buying.
After the meeting at a government chateau east of Prague, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that the government would aim to provide more funds to export promotion agencies such as the Czech Export Bank, and its sister export insurance agency.
He said he also told the business leaders that it was also necessary for businesses to lower their expectations of higher inflation because it had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
""We can not automatically appease the expectation of, let's say, nine percent inflation, and make that the basis for all further expenditure -- price and wage items,"" Klaus said.
He said that this would be key to the government's position in collective bargaining.
""We have to radically break this (inflation expectation). This must be the basis of this year's debates on collective agreements.""

14,"A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:
Journalist: ""Could you please tell me Mr Novak's first name?""
Secretary, with no hesitation: ""Doctor.""
Czechs are obsessed with academic titles. It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained ""Doctor of Law"" which forced him to resign from the cabinet on Tuesday in a confession on the floor of parliament.
""In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,"" said Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute.
Normal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as ""Mr Engineer"" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or ""Mr Doctor"", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers and PhD-holding journalists.
Kalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.
His resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised moniker, indicated by initials JUDr, in campaign material and biographies.
Apart from Kalvoda, only one has resigned from parliament, three others refusing to do so.
""I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,"" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of ""Dr"" for this story.
The Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title of Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD), but he does not inisist on its use by others.
Some of the title-envy stems from four decades of communism, which ended with 1989's bloodless ""Velvet Revolution"" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.
Communist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.
Kalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.
The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml -- a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.
The daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.
Havel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and was never allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.
""He made himself a name, not a title,"" Lidove Noviny wrote.

14,"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, in his dual role as economics professor, said on Monday the large Czech foreign trade deficit came from a temporary investment wave, and he forecast a perpetual, but smaller trade gap.
Lecturing a packed assembly hall at the Prague School of Economics, Klaus, a freshly-accredited professor of economics, said the record 110.7 billion crown trade deficit in the first nine months of this year was ""not tragic"".
""It would be correct to discuss the current account, or the whole payment balance, and not just the trade balance... due to a number of structural phenomena,"" Klaus said.
""The Czech Republic will probably not have a positive trade balance in the long term, ever,"" he added.
Klaus said the current trade deficit was ""the temporary above-average rate of investment.""
He said the investment boom would ease, leading to a narrowing in the differential with savings, but a lack of natural resources, the structure of the Czech economy, and its geographical position would perpetuate a trade deficit.
In the first nine months of this year, imports rose by a nominal 15.2 percent, year-on-year, to 551.2 billion crowns, while exports climbed 5.9 percent to 440.5 percent.
The Czech Statistical Bureau forecast last week that the foreign trade deficit would reach 163.3 billion crowns for the whole of 1996, up from about 95.7 billion crowns last year.
The current account deficit stood at 46.7 billion crowns, or 6.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half, and the CSU foreacsts it to reach 6.9 percent of GDP for the whole of 1996, and 6.8-7.4 percent of GDP next year.
Klaus repeated his long-held objection to a devaluation of the Czech crown, saying it would not help much as exports ""are not a straight function of the exchange rate"".
He also criticised export lobbyists' calls for an import surcharge and higher tariffs, and blasted moves to ""Buy Czech"", saying each country should use its comparative advantages in production and cannot make everything itself.
Klaus said his government's aim was to stop an acceleration in the deficit, and then to start lowering it. He said the increase could be stopped by the beginning of 1998.
There is no theory on what is the maximum-bearable deficit of the current account, as a percentage of GDP, Klaus said.
He said that the Czech Republic had more than sufficient foreign exchange reserves cover the gap. The Czech central bank said official reserves totalled roughly $13 billion at the end of August, with gross banking-sector reserves at $16.6 billion.
Answering a student's question on export structure, Klaus said that exports of high-added-value goods would help the overall trade balance, but such technology would take time to develop.
""How high can you jump? One metre thirty? It would be better if you could jump one-eighty.... But you can't do that straight away, you need to train it,"" Klaus said.
With practise ""maybe you'll get to some 140 centimetres in a year's time,"" he said.

14,"The Czech Republic could have a 50,000- 100,000 tonne sugar surplus from this year's campaign but little will be exported due to high local production costs and a world sugar surplus, sugar experts say.
The Agriculture Ministry said the state would buy some surplus sugar for strategic reserves and would prepare indirect support for exporters but it ruled out direct export subsidies.
Industry sources varied in their assesment of potential foreign markets but agreed producers will try to sell as much as they can at home as world prices were considerably lower.
""It is expected that the surplus will be up to 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes,"" said Eva Divisova of the ministry, adding that total production will be between 520,000 and 540,000 tonnes raw value after last campaign's 460,035 tonnes.
She added net sugar exports should be about 4,000 tonnes. Divisova declined to say how much the state would buy for its reserves, nor what the reserves are, saying this was secret.
""State reserves will be filled, other parts will have to be exported. But it is very difficult to get to foreign markets,"" Divisova added.
She said Slovakia was not importing due to higher output. There are payment problems with Ukraine and Russia, but former Yugoslav countries were potentially interesting, she said.
Director of trading firm Agrointernational Petr Prochazka believed the surplus would total 50,000-80,000 tonnes, most of which would stay in the Czech Republic.
""The surplus will not be so dramatic...There are quite good yields but the harvest is going slowly due to bad weather. A forecast freeze and subsequent warming will limit output.""
""Producers will not want to export...(because of low prices) Those who can store it, will, he told Reuters, adding he believed the state could buy up to 20,000 tonnes for reserves.
Secretary of the Sugar Refiners' Association Vladimir Ulrich also saw a 50,000-80,000-tonne surplus but said it could be partially swallowed by the state and the elasticity of domestic consumption. But he stressed that financial costs of storing sugar could push producers to sell at any price.
Ulrich said local prices have dropped to 12-15 crowns per kilo from 16 earlier in the year. The market is protected by a 68.4 percent tariff, which will drop next year to 65 percent.
""We are pushed from two sides -- the domestic surplus and low price on the world market. If prices drop further, other sugar could get here,"" Ulrich told Reuters.
Breweries could buy up to 10,000 tonnes more than they usually do if prices go below the costs of malt, and citric acid makers could take care of another 10,000 tonnes, Ulrich said.
""There is a hunger for sugar in Bulgaria, Romaina, Ukraine, also in Russia,"" said Ulrich. He added that Poland, which itself expects to have a sizeable surplus, was also a potential market.
""We also cannot expect to supply the London exchange, because our sugar does not meet the conditions,"" he noted.
He said Cezch exporters could also look to traditional markts like Saudi Arabia...""Of course, the price would be poor.""
The ministry and Ulrich said the surplus would lead to a smaller sown area next year after 104,115 hectares this year. ""I believe the optimal area for next few years would be between 90,000 and 94,000 hectares,"" Ulrich said.

14,"The largest Czech commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s., said on Friday that profits in the first nine months of this year fell some 10 percent due to accounting changes. The shares rose on the news.
The bank's net profit, calculated under international accounting standards, declined to 4.88 billion crowns from 5.44 billion, but Komercni shares moved higher on the Prague Stock Exchange as analysts praised the results.
The bank's finance division director Kamil Ziegler told a news conference that since third quarter 1995, Komercni had revised its accounting method to exclude unpaid late fees and commissions.
""Our profit, according to international accounting standards, is roughly 10 percent lower than in the same period of the last year. But there are very important methodological influences,"" Ziegler told reporters.
Only those fees that have actually been paid are included in the figures now whereas outstanding receivables were included previously, he said.
He added that the amount of late fees that would have been included under the previous accounting method was 1.2 billion crowns. Komercni posted a 5.11 billion net profit for the whole of 1995.
The bank's total assets rose to 432.04 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter from 336.21 billion, year-on-year.
The net interest margin declined to 4.07 percent from 5.40 percent, but up from 3.93 percent at the end of the first half.
Under Czech accounting standards, which Ziegler said do not include the tital of 700 million crowns of unrealised gains from securities, Komercni's gross profit for the period was 3.87 billion, down from 6.83 billion year on year.
He told rpeorters that he considered the results to be ""very good"", but warned that simple annualisation of the nine month figures would not lead to a full-year profit forecast.
He said fourth quarter results could be affected by unclear development on the stock market and other factors.
Sandy Winthrop Chen, vice president of equity research at the Prague office of CS First Boston, welcomed the figures,
""The results are quite in line with our expectations, I think the performance is very strong, and it puts Komercni Banka in a very good position to meet or exceed out 1996 forecast.""
He added that the forecast was a 5.95 billion crown net profit, according to international standards.
Komercni share price jumped 125 crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange soon after the news to 2,125, and closed at 2,126 after a week of heavy losses in which some analysts anticipated poor results.
Dealer Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings said the results were in line with his expectations and partly attributed Komercni's share price rise to demand from foreign investors.
""Some of the foreign investors...think they are not so bad therefore we can see some demand in the stock,"" he said.
Added Chen: ""We definitely remain buyers of the stock, and the recent weakeness in the shareprice we interpret as a major buyer opportunity.""
Komercni's largest shareholder is still the Czech government which has a 48.74 percent stake, followed by the Bank of New York which has accumlated a 9.65 percent stake.

14,"The party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus performed strongly in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at 35 percent, the real winner was apathy.
In what was billed as a key test of the minority coalition government, Klaus's centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) took a commanding 36.47 percent of the first round vote, with the opposition Social Democrats trailing on 20.27 percent.
The result was a major improvement for the ODS, which won only 29.6 percent in elections to the lower house in June when a strong Social Democrat performance of 26.4 percent stripped Klaus's three-party coalition of its majority.
Klaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance.
""It is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability,"" he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate since the inconclusive lower house polls.
""These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal,"" he said.
Klaus also sidestepped questions on whether he might seek early lower house elections to try to regain his majority.
But analysts said the results may be misleading. Unlike the lower house system of proportional representation, the Senate is elected in two rounds of a first-past-the-post system.
Only three ODS candidates won outright in the first round held on Friday and Saturday. Another 76 face a run-off on November 22-23 between the top two contenders in constitiuencies where no-one won more than half the first round vote.
Also, the well-organised and funded ODS is better at rallying support when public interest in elections is low than the Social Democrats. Klaus cannot therefore automatically rely on repeating the performance in a lower house election, when turnout is usually over 75 percent.
But the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans, who boycotted the elections to the newly-created upper house and told fellow Czechs to do likewise.
The Central Election Commission said turnout was just 35.03 percent, far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections in June.
Zeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.
But he added: ""I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates.""
In the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running.
Sladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent rally.
Polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.

14,"The Czech Republic's sole supplier of natural gas, Russia's Gazprom, has agreed to start talks on a long-term supply deal, Industry and Trade minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Tuesday.
He said the talks would focused on a contract for supplies of 8.9 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year.
""Today's offer respects this conclusion (of the Czech government to diversify supplies),"" Dlouhy told a news conference after meeting Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev.
""That means supplies of only 8.9 bcm, and an agreement to start negotiations on a long-term contract. I consider this to be a good result,"" he said.
The Czech Republic currently imports all of its roughly nine bcm of natural gas a year from Gazprom under a three-year contract ending in 1998, extendable for another three years.
Dlouhy said Gazprom had accepted that the Czechs want to partially diversify their gas supplies.
""Until now, they have been trying to save the 100 percent coverage. Today they came with an offer -- not all supplies from Russia,"" he added.
The consumption is expected to rise to about 12 to 13 bcm per year in several years. The country wants to cover the increase from alternative sources.
Dlouhy's deputy, Miroslav Tvrznik, told reporters that the aim was to bring the contract with Gazprom to ""a European standard of 15 to 25 years"".
Dlouhy said talks would start with several potential partners to choose how to diversify the supplies. These talks would be included in a report to the full cabinet which should make a ""more concrete"" decision next January, Dlouhy said.
""We would want to have the first supplies from diversified sources already in the year 1997,"" he said.
He added that some of the options would include buying Russian gas through an intermediary, possibly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF.
Dlouhy said these partners would provide a guarantee of supplying from their own sources in case of emergency.
He also said an earlier announced option of buying some gas from Norway was still under consideration, and said that Germany's  BEB Erdgas und Erdoil, or U.S.-based Mobil could serve as ""supplementary sources"".

16,"Ailing Union Plc, formerly a pillar of the London money market scene, could be broken up to release shareholder value after the company said it would not pay a final dividend for 1996, analysts said on Tuesday.
They said a buyer might be found for Union's profitable fees and commission businesses to break them away from the loss making trading division which has been hard-hit by changes in the money market.
""Union has lurched from crisis to crisis in the past few years,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
""It could be that they have come to the conclusion that it's time to salvage what they can for shareholders.""
Formerly known as Union Discount and with famously palatial offices in Cornhill in London's financial heartland, Union has had limited success in its struggle to diversify away from its traditional role as a discount house in the mysterious and highly cyclical and volatile workings of the money market.
Forays into medical equipment leasing and equities market-making, in the shape of Winterflood Securities, ended in disposals and the years have seen Union shrink to a shadow of its former self with a market value of only 25 million pounds.
Now, Union says the Bank of England's plan to remove the exclusive right of the seven discount houses to deal directly with the Bank in its liquidity operations will ""have a significant impact on the group's future.""
As a consequence, it said that Advance Corporation Tax (ACT), which it had intended to carry forward on its books, would now have to be written off.
It gave no figures but said this would rule out the payment of a final dividend for 1996.
It also said that it would not receive any profit contribution in the 1996 year from a venture to sell equity index options trading software in Canada.
Analysts said they had expected Union to hold its full year payout at three pence per share, with 1.5 pence coming in the second half.
Union has said that it wants to develop its fee earning businesses and move away from a dangerous dependence on trading.
The fee and commission businesses include the Union CAL futures and foreign exchange broking, liquidity fund manager Union Fund Management and Cornhill Commercial Services, which provides project finance advice and consultancy.
Late last year the two ""discount houses"", Gerrard &amp; National and King &amp; Shaxon, merged but with them, the money market side of the business takes a back seat compared to private-client stockbroking and fund management.
Union shares closed 12 pence lower at 81-1/2, having collapsed to 73p at one point.
Directors at Union were not immediately available for comment.

16,"British property giant Land Securities said on Wednesday there were signs of rental growth in some sectors of the British property market and that it expected more to come.
Company chairman Peter Hunt said that while there was a feeling there was more rental growth to come, so far it had been patchy.
Growth in rental rates would be slower than in the 1980s and because it was not across the board it was crucial to be selective in the properties and developments chosen.
Land on Wednesday reported a pre-tax profit of 128.9 million pounds ($213 million) for the first half, including sales of properties, from 118.1 million pounds last time.
The company, which reported an increased interim dividend of 7.35 pence, said it had plans for ""major shopping centre schemes"" in a number of British towns, including Canterbury, York and Sunderland, as well as ""several proposed new leisure developments"".
The group said the annual level of expenditure on its current development programme was expected to peak during the second half of the financial year.
It said revenue profit, which was down to 115.5 million pounds from 118.2 million pounds for the period, ""is being affected by our prudent policy of not capitalising interest as part of the cost of carrying our substantial programme"".
But it was upbeat on its overall prospects. ""We believe that our strategy of creating growth assets through development will result in a considerable addition to the rental income and capital value of the portfolio in years to come,"" Hunt said.
""Yes, they (the developments) are on target, although you can never be totally sure,"" he added in an interview.
Finance director Jim Murray told Reuters a drop in revenue profit for the half year, to 115.5 million pounds from 118.2 million pounds the previous year, was widely expected and had been flagged in advance.
This reflected the fact that the group was financing a large development programme and was not capitalising interest as part of the cost of carrying this out.
Hunt said property developments continued to be higher yielding business but that most land-owners were holding out on the sale of good land.
""(There is) a much better performance on a development. It is the best growth stock...it's very much in demand. That's why we are concentrating on doing as much development as we can,"" Hunt added.
The group was also buying investments in the ""second-hand"" market. ""We are pursuing both avenues,"" he said, pointing out that Land Securities had recently added the Team Valley Retail Park, south of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, to its portfolio.
This would make ""a substantial and valuable addition to our 500 million pound retail warehouse portfolio,"" he said in his chairman's statement.
During the half year the company had bought, or agreed to buy, nearly 80 million pounds of investment properties.
Hunt said he did not think there would be a less favourable environment for the group if Britiain's opposition Labour party won power from the ruling Conservative government at the next general election, due to be held by May 1997.
""I believe the strategies we are pursuing will apply equally within a New Labour environment as in a Conservative (one).""
Hunt said that while he could not comment on possible acquisition targets, the firm looked at ""everything from time to time"" but would have to ""want to own quite a high proportion of the properties"" of any target company before making a bid.

16,"Lloyds Bank was fined 325,000 pounds ($550,000) Wednesday by a British investment industry watchdog and appears set to pay millions of pounds in compensation to disadvantaged customers.
The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation said it fined Lloyds, which merged with TSB last year to form Lloyds TSB Group Plc, for breaches of rules relating to its pensions transfer business between April 1988 and June 1993.
Lloyds agreed to a settlement of disciplinary proceedings brought against it, the fifth such settlement IMRO has made with firms that have been found guilty of improper sales of pension products.
IMRO said Lloyds ""did not obtain or have systems to obtain all relevant facts about the personal and financial circumstances of its customers needed to advise them properly about pensions transfers.""
It said Lloyds had not provided certain customers ""with all the information needed to enable them to make a balanced and informed decision on whether to carry out a pension transfer.""
Lloyds, which must pay IMRO's investigation costs of 63,000 pounds ($107,000) and make a contribution to its disciplinary costs, has already offered redress to some customers and the review of some 2,600 Lloyds transfer cases ""is well advanced and will be substantially completed by Dec. 31, 1997,"" IMRO added.
The bank expressed its regret in a statement.
""Lloyds Bank deeply regrets the errors which have resulted in charges being brought against it by IMRO for its pension transfer business,"" it said.
As a group, Lloyds TSB has made provisions totalling 165 million pounds ($279 million) for possible compensation payments to do with the mis-selling of pension products.
These relate to the Lloyds Bank business as well as the pensions activities of TSB before the merger, and of Lloyds' insurance subsidiary Lloyds Abbey Life.
The pension scandal, whereby individuals transferred their pensions and were disadvantaged as a result, has been one of the most serious faced by the British financial services industry in recent years.
The affair knocked a big hole in the public's confidence in the industry and companies are set to pay a price running into hundreds of million of pounds as a result.
In November, Britain's top financial markets regulator the Securities and Investments Board announced a new strategy to try and clear a logjam in the pensions industry's review of the selling of pension products and the payment of compensation to investors.
Both regulators and insurance and investment companies have come under a barrage of criticism over the length of time it has taken to complete a review of cases.
Lloyds said it has identified some 2,600 pension transfer customers of which it anticipates having to pay compensation to around 1,500.

16,"Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel on Monday announced details of a deal giving bank creditors 45.5 percent of the company in return for wiping out 1.0 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) of its massive debts.
The long-awaited but highly complex restructuring of nearly nearly nine billion pounds of debt and unpaid interest throws the company a lifeline which could secure what is still likely to be a difficult future.
The deal, announced simultaneously in Paris and London, brings the company back from the brink of bankruptcy but leaves current shareholders, who have already seen their investment dwindle, owning only 54.5 percent of the company.
""We have fixed and capped the interest payments and arranged only to pay what is available in cash,"" Eurotunnel co-chairman Alastair Morton told reporters at a news conference. ""Avoiding having to do this again is the name of the game.""
Morton said the plan provides the Anglo-French company with the medium term financial stability to consolidate its commercial position and develop its operations, adding that the firm was now making a profit before interest.
Although shareholders will see their holdings diluted, they were offered the prospect of a brighter future and urged to be patient after months of uncertainty while Eurotunnel wrestled to reduce the crippling interest payments negotiated during the tunnel's construction.
Eurotunnel, which has taken around half of the market in the busiest cross-Channel route from the European ferry companies, said a strong operating performance could allow it to pay its first dividend within the next 10 years.
French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle told reporters at a Paris news conference that the dividend could come as early as 2004 if the company performed ""very well"".
Eurotunnel and the banks have come up with an ingenious formula to help the company get over the early years of the deal when, despite the swaps of debt for equity and bonds, it will still not be able to afford the annual interest bill of 400 million pounds.
If its revenue, after costs and depreciation, is less than 400 million pounds, then the company will issue ""Stabilisation notes"" to a maximum of 1.85 billion pounds to the banks. Eurotunnel would not pay interest on these notes (which would constitute a debt issue) for ten years.
Analysts said that under the deal, Eurotunnel's ability to finance its debt would become sustainable, at least for a few years.
""If you look at the current cash flow of between 150 and 200 million pounds a year, what they can't find (to meet the bill) they will roll forward into the stabilisation notes, and they can keep that going for seven, eight, nine years,"" said an analyst at one major investment bank.
""So they are here for that time,"" he added.
The company said in a statement there was still considerable work to be done to finalise and agree the details of the plan before it can be submitted to shareholders and the bank group for approval, probably early in the Spring of 1997.
Eurotunnel said the debt-for-equity swap would be at 130 pence, or 10.40 francs, per share -- considerably below the level of 160 pence widely reported in the run up to the deal
The company said a further 3.7 billion pounds of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue.
If they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders' interests may be reduced further to just over 39 percent of the company by the end of December 2003.
Eurotunnel's shares, which were suspended last week at 113.5 pence ahead of Monday's announcement, will resume trading on Tuesday.
Shareholders and all 225 creditor banks have to agree the deal. ""I'm hopeful but I'm not taking it (approval) for granted,"" Morton admitted, ""Shareholders are pretty angry in France.""
Asked what would happen if the banks reject the deal, Morton said, ""Nobody wants a collapse, nobody wants a doomsday scenario.""

16,"British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke could cut tax credits on dividends in a ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" measure which would help fund widely expected cuts in income tax in his budget speech next Tuesday.
Roger Bootle, group chief economist at HSBC Markets, thinks Clarke may well see pension funds as one target to provide him with some resources to distribute elsewhere.
From a tax credit reduction to 15 percent from 20 percent, ""the sufferers would be tax-exempt pension funds and higher rate tax payers with dividend income,"" Bootle said on Thursday.
Accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, in its survey of budget options, says such a measure could save the Inland Revenue around 1.0 billion pounds ($1.68 billion) a year, although this would take some time to come through.
But Coopers point out that such a move would act against the Government's long-term objective of encouraging increased private savings provision and might turn out to be a burden on the corporate sector if institutional shareholders press companies to compensate by raising gross dividend payouts.
Bootle raises another negative aspect.
""It would not necessarily be popular either,"" he says. ""It would probably cause the equity market to fall and might well be described in the press as ""Mr Clarke raids your pension - to give you an income tax cut'.""
Clarke has already removed the tax credit on targeted share buy-backs and special dividends associated with share consolidations and take-overs.
Most economists expect no change in the basic structure of Corporation Tax itself, although Coopers say the Chancellor might introduce some minor measures to aid small business and entrepreneurs.
But they are not so confident that the profit-related pay scheme, first introduced in 1987, will survive the budget unscathed.
Under the scheme, employees get relief at their marginal rate of tax on 20 percent of their salary up to a maximum of 4,000 stg and the benfits are linked to the company reaching profit goals agreed with the Revenue.
Estimates vary on how many employees are in the scheme from 3.5 to 4.5 million, but accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young says it is costing the Government some 1.5 billion pounds annually in lost revenue and rising.
There also seems to be a measure of agreement on the idea that the scheme does not really link employees' pay to profitability since some companies guarantee no reduction in final salary if profits disappoint.
Outright abolition of PRP is thought unlikely given it is firmly entrenched in many pay structures and would again put pressure on companies to make up the difference and so economists see Clarke possibly limiting the relief to the lower 20 percent rate of income tax.
BZW economists say this could raise some 700 million pounds. ($1=.5950 Pound)

""Reinstatement doesn't seem very likely,"" she told Reuters.
Horlick is waging a campaign for reinstatement or compensation from the firm from which she resigned in a blaze of publicity last week after allegations that she planned to defect and poach some of her colleagues.
But so far MGAM, and its parent company Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG), have remained deaf to her pleas.
Horlick met her lawyer John Farr of law firm Herbert Smith again on Tuesday and although her advisers hinted it was far too early to talk of legal action against DMG, this has not been ruled out by Horlick's camp.
The advisers indicated an early resolution of the dispute was unlikely and could take several weeks as Deutsche and MGAM had still to complete an internal inquiry into the affair.
""It will take several days, if not weeks, I should think,"" one adviser said.
Despite indications that discussions took place on Tuesday between Farr and DMG's legal representatives, a DMG spokesman denied there had been further contact.
The bank is sticking firmly to its guns in the row with the 35-year-old mother of five, one of London's most prominent fund managers.
It says Horlick, having been promoted to the rank of managing director, was suspended just days later for ""soliciting staff"" to join a rival firm and then resigned her position.
The plot has thickened amid unconfirmed allegations that this was a prelude to a takeover of MGAM's pension fund business by Dutch bank ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO declined to comment on the latest reports but has already denied having tried to poach Horlick and her team.
On Tuesday, however, the Dutch bank acknowledged it would be interested in buying a large British fund manager and its global asset management director Jan Vroegop told Reuters it would like to make ""big steps"" in London funds management.
Horlick continues to deny allegations that she was leading a breakaway group.
DMG's line is that Horlick will not be reinstated and that there will be no compensation because she had resigned. DMG's parent Deutsche Bank also said late Monday that it did not expect to go to court with Horlick.
Deutsche board member Rolf Breuer, who is poised to take over the helm of Deutsche in May from Hilmar Kopper, said: ""The facts are clear. Mrs Horlick inflicted damage on the bank with her attempt to poach staff and then resigned.""
Meanwhile, differing versions of what led up to her suspension continued to trickle out.
British newspaper reports said ABN AMRO was involved with Horlick in planning to fund a management buyout of the 18 billion pounds ($30 billion) pension fund business which Horlick headed.
They said ABN ARMO planned to recruit Horlick and her team and then to offer to buy the residue from Morgan Grenfell for a reported 385 million pounds.
Horlick's colleagues were reported to have been unconvinced by the merits of ABN's alleged plan to poach the team, not least because one of the team's key aims had been to have Horlick promoted to a more influential position within MGAM. Once this happened it removed a key complaint against top management.
MGAM has had a troubled time since the sacking of fund manager Peter Young last September after irregularities came to light in three of the group's funds, hitting staff morale and also rattling clients.
Young has denied any criminal activity and is being investigated by Britain's Serious Fraud Office.
So far no clients have withdrawn their business from MGAM as a result of the Horlick affair. However, several major clients have expressed their concern and said they would be reviewing their relationship with the firm. ($1=.6021 Pound)

16,"Former Barings treasury and risk chief Ian Hopkins has been banned from being a director in the City, industry sources said on Thursday after a three-day disciplinary hearing.
Britain's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) said in a statement that the outcome would not be formally announced until after any appeal process had ended.
But the sources said the tribunal had banned Hopkins from being a registered director for three years and ordered him to pay an unspecified amount of costs.
Hopkins, who was not immediately available for comment, did not appear before the tribunal, chaired by Judge Colin Kolbert, and was not legally represented.
After he has been formally given the full written judgment, he will have 10 business days to lodge an appeal.
Hopkins was among a group of former Barings executives against whom the SFA brought disciplinary charges for their part in the downfall of the investment bank. It collapsed nearly two years ago when Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson ran up debts of almost $1.4 billion in unauthorised derivatives trades.
Hopkins, who worked for Barings in London, has always maintained that he tried to warn other Barings executives of the bank's dangerous position but that he was effectively ignored.
He told a parliamentary committee investigation into Barings last year that his attempts to alert more senior Barings staff to potential problems had failed. He painted a picture of culture clashes between the traditional Barings banking activities and its newer securities activities.
In the official Singaporean report into the Barings affair, executives of the bank were criticised for not heeding Hopkins's warnings.
""In our view, the collapse might have been averted if Mr Hopkins's concerns had been taken seriously, and acted upon promptly and effectively,"" the Singapore inspectors said.
The tribunal heard the SFA case, put by prominent barrister Presiley Baxendale, and questioned seven witnesses. It also took into account evidence given by Hopkins to the Singapore enquiry and to Britain's Board of Banking Supervision.
Earlier this month the SFA reprimanded Barings former head of equity derivatives Mary Walz for her part in the bank's collapse and has already banned several other former Barings executives including former chief executive Peter Norris.

16,"Britain's Serious Fraud Office has yet to contact London-based securities houses after a request for help with a French probe into Eurotunnel SA /Plc share dealings, market sources said on Monday.
The SFO said on Sunday it had been asked to lend a hand in an investigation by the French authorities into alleged market manipulation of the debt-laden channel tunnel operator's shares.
The SFO said it would help in the French probe although it had no grounds to launch an investigation of its own into the dealings which form the basis of the latest Paris investigation.
Securities firms contacted by Reuters on Monday said they had received no approach from the SFO and did not expect to do so. They all said they would co-operate fully if they were approached.
The investigation is another chapter in a troubled corporate story littered with incidents, which earlier this year saw two firms -- Salomon Brothers and Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) -- cleared of insider trading.
The two had been among underwriters of a Eurotunnel rights issue in 1994 and, although never named by Paris stock exchange watchdog the Commission de Operations de Bourse (COB), said that they were under investigation in July last year.
The underwriting group also included Banque Indosuez, Morgan Grenfell, now owned by Deutsche Bank AG, Societe de Banque, Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Paribas, Caisse des Depots, Crdit Agricole, Credit Lyonnais, Robert Fleming, S.G. Warburg (now part of SBC) and Belgian utility Tractebel SA.
About two thirds of Eurotunnel shares are held in France and, as a general rule, more trading in the shares goes on in Paris than in London.
The SFO's usual practise is to issue notices which require a person or institution to be interviewed or hand over documents, although it can also apply for a search warrant if it wants to surprise its target.
On Monday, it remained unclear what period is currently under investigation.
The COB has already investigated the period surrounding the rights issue, though it could be revisiting this highly volatile time.
There have been persistent suggestions that some operators were short-selling at around the time of the rights issue -- forcing the prices down by selling shares they do not own in the hope of buying them back more cheaply later.
Eurotunnel has called on stock exchange authorities on both sides of the Channel to investigate volatile dealings at various times over the years.
Another example was in Agust 1995, when a rogue report that the company had signed a debt rescheduling agreement sent the stock reeling.
The Anglo-French tunnel operator at that time denied it had signed a debt agreement and demanded an inquiry into the trading activity and erroneous reports surrounding its shares and the incident might well be the focus of the French probe.
The incident occurred around three weeks before Eurotunnel announced a payments freeze on its huge debts and entered into negotiations on a rescheduling resulting in a restructuring of the debt announced a year later -- a year which also saw its fair share of leaks and speculation.

16,"International accountancy and consultancy partnership Ernst &amp; Young said it made a profit of 75.2 million pounds ($125.4 million) in Britain as it revealed financial details of its operations for the first time on Tuesday.
The 21 percent rise in profit in the year to June 30 was made on gross fee income of 456 million pounds and represented a 17 percent rise in average profit per partner of 200,000 pounds.
Ernst &amp; Young's senior partner Nick Land also confirmed that the firm was still planning to become a limited liability partnership registered in the Channel Island of Jersey despite the fact that the government has said it intends to introduce legislation recognising partnerships of this kind in Britain.
Land also said that Ernst &amp; Young's worlwide revenue for the year to September would show a 13 percent rise to $7.8 billion.
Ernst &amp; Young is the world's largest tax accontancy practice and the second largest management comsultancy after Arthur Andersen. It was formed in 1989 from the merger of Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young.
Ernst &amp; Young's move to limited liablity reflects an industry-wide change whereby accountancy firms feel exposed by their current unlimited liablity status, which puts personal assets in jeopardy if the firm were to become insolvent.
Under an LLP, only the capital subscribed by each partner, which currently totals some 72 million pounds, and the personal assets of those partners shown to be directly responsible for any negligent act leading to a loss would be at risk.
Land said there was too much political uncertainty in Britain ahead of next year's general election to rely on British legislation regarding LLPs emerging any time soon.
The firm's move to LLP status is dependent on Jersey's legislation being finally approved and on the LLP's tax status being agreed with Britain's Inland Revenue.
Land said that Ernst &amp; Young's decision to publish its results had not been taken to gain any advantage.
""We are not doing this for any competitive advantage,"" Land said. ""We just thought it was time that we did it.""
He added that Ernst &amp; Young wanted to take a full part in the debate on corporate governance and could hardly do so unless its own financial affairs were transparent.
""Clients are also beginning to ask questions about our financial strength.""
Fastest growth in the past year was shown by Ernst &amp; Young's management consultancy which increased gross fees by 40 percent to 77.4 million pounds.
Only its insolvency practice saw a decline in fees during the year, ironically hit by the recovery in the British economy.

16,"The British government on Wednesday published proposed new laws governing home lenders which watered down the building societies' immunity from takeover if they converted into banks.
The new legislation provoked a cool response from some home lenders and prompted one leading player to say its plans for conversion may well have been different if it had known what the government was planning.
Under the new draft law, a building society  would forfeit its five-year immunity from takeover after it converted to bank status if it took over another financial institution.
The Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($50 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government had not taken account of its ""serious concerns"" on the timing of the draft.
""Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,"" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.
The Treasury acknowledged the new Building Societies Bill might not even make it to the statute book before an election because of a lack of parliamentary time between now and next May, the last date for the polls to be called.
If it went ahead, the Woolwich spokeswoman said the board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester in a statement also expressed disappointment, and said areas of concern ""have still not been fully resolved.""
""We will now need to move forward while carefully considering outstanding issues,"" the Alliance statement said, noting the move came in the middle of ""a long and costly conversion process"".
In contrast the Northern Rock, a third society which plans a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.
""We are delighted with it,"" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. ""It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you can't ask for more than that.""
A Treasury spokeswoman said it still hoped to find time for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda in the New Year.
""The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,"" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. ""When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.""
The Building Societies Association welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.
BSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's ""thoughtful compromise"" on the question of takeover protection.
Under current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.
Some societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.
""We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,"" the Treasury said.
The Halifax, the country's biggest home lender has already waived its right to takeover protection by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary. ($1=.6003 Pound)

38,"The French government sold a nine percent stake in oil major Elf-Aquitaine on Wednesday, raising around 10 billion francs ($2 billion) and allowing the energy group to buy back a big chunk of its own shares.
The disposal follows a sharp rise in the Paris bourse in recent weeks and, specifically of oil stocks which have benefited from high world oil prices.
""Finance minister Jean Arthuis has decided to sell 24.9 million shares in Elf-Aquitaine held by the ERAP company, which will reduce the stake held by this public sector firm in Elf-Aquitaine to 0.75 percent,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The sale involved the placement of 12.5 million Elf shares, or 4.6 percent of the capital, at 417.50 francs per share to French and international institutions.
Elf said in a separate statement it had bought a 4.5 percent stake through its indirectly-owned financial Fingestval company as a long-term investment, accounting for the remainder of the shares sold by the state.
Elf shares slipped 2.5 francs to 423 by 1300 GMT.
The 10 billion francs will go into a government special account held for share sale proceeds, which is reserved for injecting into other state-owned companies, the ministry said.
Government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said the money would be used to recapitalise state-owned companies which needed it, particularly those being privatised.  It will not be used to help reduce the government's budget deficit.
France plans to recapitalise Thomson SA to the tune of 11 billion francs before selling the state-owned electronics group to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo Electronics Corp.
The Elf share sale leaves a rump 0.75 percent of Elf stock in government hands, which covers free shares due to Elf employees and non-voting petroleum certificates held by the state.
Elf was among the early privatisations in the previous conservative government of Edouard Balladur in February 1994 (Corrects timing of Elf privatisation), when it was floated at 385 francs per share to private investors.
The group has wide-ranging interests in oil exploration, production and refining, as well as health and beauty products through its Sanofi unit.
It is a major constitutuent in the Paris CAC-40 share index.
The group's stock purchase would boost earnings per share, chairman Philippe Jaffre said: ""This removes the uncertainty surrounding the French state's interest in the company which has weighed on the share price.""
""The acquisition will automatically improve earnings per share,"" he said in a company statement.
The sale to institutions was handled by Paribas and SBC Warburg, after a tender with various banks. ABN Amro Rothschild acted as adviser to the government.
Fingestval is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Socap, which itself is wholly-owned by Sofaxbanque. Sofaxbanque is 100-percent owned by Elf. Socap manages assets and financial interests and has substantial cash holdings, Fingestval said. ($1=5.088 French Franc)

38,"The European Airbus consortium said on Tuesday it was confidently pressing ahead with studies on a 555-seat passenger plane despite a decision by archrival Boeing to scale back work on a larger jumbo jet.
Boeing on Monday said market conditions did not justify the risk and expense of building a new version of its 747 jumbo jet, the 747-X, and it was diverting half the 1,000 staff on that project to smaller planes.
""We are confident the A3XX will meet market needs,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""The signs from major airlines working with us on shaping the A3XX are definitely encouraging.""
Airbus, ever quick to seize on any perceived gaps in Boeing's armour, says airlines want an all-new plane rather than Boeing's 747-X, which the Airbus spokesman said was the ""end of the line for a product developed in the late 1960s"".
""Airlines want to fly into the 21st century facing forward, not backwards,"" the spokesman added.
Airbus must attack Boeing's monopoly on the large-capacity segment and is studying designs for an A3XX product family which it hopes to launch in 1998 for service in 2003.
It wants to grab at least half of the aircraft market by the end of the decade, up from its estimated historic share of 35 percent. But it lacks large planes to compete with Boeing's 777 giant twinjet and the best-selling 747 jumbo.
The four-nation consortium differs with Boeing over the potential market and development costs for a new large plane.
Airbus forecasts a market of 1,383 planes seating more than 400 passengers over the next 20 years, while Boeing believes demand would only stretch to 470 planes seating 500 or more, which would not allow it to get a return on its money.
A basic A3XX would cost around $200 million, giving potential sales worth more than $275 billion on the Airbus forecast.
""A split market would have been a big challenge for two manufacturers but now Boeing is opting out, that enhances our prospects,"" the Airbus spokesman said.
Airbus accepts the view that the market will fragment further as people want to fly more frequently, non-stop, long distance between city pairs.
The ""fragmentation"" effect was one of the factors cited by Boeing for cutting demand for larger planes and reducing the importance of big airport hubs.
But Airbus believes it will meet that market change with its A340 long-haul plane and that the A3XX will co-exist.
Saturation of air routes and airport landing slots calls for higher capacity planes, it argues. Countering critics who point to already lengthy waits at airports, it says its A3XX designs would allow a quicker passenger turnaround than the jumbo.
Airbus is talking to 14 leading airlines on what the plane should offer and is confident that it can match or better the airlines' operating demands. These include fitting within an 80 metre ""box"" at the airport terminal.
It is officially sticking to its estimated $8 billion development cost for the A3XX, despite scepticism among some experts that it cannot be done for less than $15 billion.
Airbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz) and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

38,"French utilities giant Compagnie Generale des Eaux on Monday posted higher first half profits and unveiled plans to reorganise its loss-making construction business, hammered by a depressed French market.
Chairman Jean-Marie Messier told a news conference the company made a first half net profit of 808 million French francs ($155.9 million), after payment to minorities, up from 224 million a year ago.
He also forecast net profit for the full year 1996 would be about 1.8 billion francs after a net loss the year before of 3.69 billion francs. The results would be ""strongly marked by exceptional items, notably capital gains from asset sales.""
For 1997, Messier expected profits to be ""much higher"" than those of 1996 and should be ""without doubt higher than the best profits the company has had in its history."" The company made 3.4 billion francs net profit in 1994.
Messier also announced Generale des Eaux said it had made a formal bid on Monday with its German partner Mannesmann to run the telecommunications operations of French state railways SNCF. The two companies want to bring British Telecom to join the bid.
Messier, who came from an investment bank, was brought in last year to clear out the group's balance sheet which had put on more than 50 billion francs of debt and been savaged by a crisis in the property market and construction business.
His first step last year was to reorganise the property arm, which he said on Monday had cost the group a total 15 billion francs since 1994.
The group expects to lose 4.6 billion francs this year due to poor property assets but that includes three billion francs of exceptional charges which should wipe out any uncertainty for the next three years, he said.
""At the end of 1996, Generale des Eaux will not face any questions, even in pessimistic scenarios for the next three years, on any exceptional charges which may arise from its property activities,"" he said.
The group's George V property development arm aims to be profitable from 1997, he said.
The group's average level of property provisioning was around 55-56 percent, of which assets in the South of France were provisioned at 65-70 percent and 85 percent at Cannes.
This time round, Messier attacked the group's building and public works businesses which have suffered from the downturn in France and Germany. He has made its SGE subsidiary the centre of its construction activity.
Into SGE will go the GTIE and Santerne electrical installations units and roadbuilders Cochery, Viafrance and SGE-VBU. And there will be a consolidation of building activity with SGE buying 40 percent of Compagnie Generale de Batiment et de Construction (CBC), currently wholly owned by CGE.
The new SGE, which will be ""radically different and attractive,"" have annual sales of 52 billion francs and will return to a significant level of profit in 1997, Messier said.
Generale des Eaux also expects to cut its debt by about 10 to 15 billion francs in 1997. It said it expected its net financial debt to stand at 53 billion francs at the end of 1996, down from 54 billion in 1995.
He said the company's operating profit would be close to the 3.7 billion franc profit recorded in 1994.
Turnover in 1996 should be up three percent to 164 billion francs, he added.
France is deregulating its telecommunications in 1998, breaking the domestic monopoly of state-owned France Telecom to comply with European Union rules. ($1=5.182 French Franc)

38,"Troubled Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA/Plc is due to release first-half results on Monday but analysts said any attempt to forecast the figures was futile, given the uncertainties over its debt restructuring.
""Everything depends on resolving the financial situation. If they announce a good figure...that might help, but it's really a face-off between the company and the bankers,"" Olivier Machou, analyst at brokerage Leven said.
Eurotunnel needs to agree a refinancing of its $12.3 billion bank debt by the end of September, having asked in July for two court-appointed mediators to stay on to negotiate a deal with its some 220-strong bank syndicate.
Machou said it was hard to forecast results due to ""dumping"" in the price war between Eurotunnel and ferry companies as they battle for a share of cross-Channel traffic between Britain and France.
""It's not a stock that you can take a view based on half-year figures, especially as the first half comes before the summer season,"" one analyst said.
However, one analyst at a large French brokerage said he had a rough forecast of a 2.5 billion franc ($492 million) net loss and an operating loss of around 100 million.
The Channel Tunnel operator posted first-half sales of 1.79 billion francs, up from 806 million a year ago. It made a net loss for the full year last year of 7.196 billion francs on turnover of 2.266 billion.
The headline figures will likely be flattered by the fact that Eurotunnel did not have all its services running a year ago, said Jeff Summers, head of research at debt specialist Klesch and Co in London.
Stripping out the minimum usage fee that the railway operators pay, he expected a 25-30 percent improvement in the underlying results from a year ago.
In sterling terms, Summers has pencilled in a 22 million pound ($34.45 million) pretax, pre-interest loss versus 121 million a year ago. With benign currency movements, it may break even.
Operating cashflow should at least double to 56 million sterling before interest and capital expenditure, compared with 29 million.
""Everything is going in its favour,"" Summers said. He cited the British government's recent decision to allow cooperation between ferry companies to pool their capacity and the European Commission's decision not to extend the duty-free sales regime beyond 1999.
Pooling by rivals such as P&amp;O and Stena would lead to ""a reduction in direct competition"" for Eurotunnel, while the loss of duty-free sales, representing 250 million sterling of soft subsidies for the ferries, would push ferry firms to raise ticket prices.
Eurotunnel could then raise its prices and boost turnover.
The cross-Channel market has also grown much faster even than Eurotunnel forecast, with traffic up 20 percent last year and estimated growth of 13-15 percent this year, Summers said.
Richard Branson, head of the London &amp; Continental Railways (LCR) group which runs the Eurostar high-speed train concession, has forecast it will hit six million passengers in the financial year 1996/97 and 10 million in 18 months.
If that happens, Eurotunnel could receive revenues above the minimum usage fee as higher service levels trigger extra payments. ($1=5.077 French Franc) ($1=.6385 Pound)

38,"European aircraft consortium Airbus said on Friday it had no evidence that archrival Boeing was putting pressure on U.S. suppliers to prevent them from working on Airbus' planned A3XX large plane.
Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) chairman, Manfred Bischoff, said on Thursday he was concerned Boeing and merger partner McDonnell Douglas were signalling to a big U.S. subcontractor, understood to be Northrop Grumman, not to work on the Airbus project, newspapers reported.
""We have no evidence of any kind of pressure,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
But an industry source close to Airbus said Boeing had put pressure on Northrop to stay out of the A3XX project, which threatens Boeing's lucrative monopoly of the high-capacity segment with its 747 jumbo. ""It is a fact,"" he said.
Dasa is a partner in Airbus Industrie, alongside France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, and Casa of Spain.
Boeing was not immediately available for comment.
Airbus had been in exploratory talks with Northrop over supplying engine housing sections for the A3XX but those negotiations had ended, the industry source said.
Airbus has been looking for risk-sharing partners to supply up to 40 percent of the targeted $8 billion in the A3XX development costs. The plane would seat 550 passengers in the basic version, which it wants to enter service in 2003.
Airbus managing director Jean Pierson told journalists on Thursday at the Toulouse headquarters that he would lay out Airbus' competition concerns on the Boeing merger when he gives evidence to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission, as expected.
In the long term, the Boeing merger ""will pose a problem for Europe's civil aviation industry,"" he said, adding there would effects in military markets, particularly helicopters.
The industry source said the merged Boeing/McDonnell company would have bigger clout on suppliers, have a wider technology base though its portfolio of patents and gain larger access to indirect state funds for research and development through military programmes.
But Pierson said the merger was inevitable. ""The Boeing-McDonnell merger will go ahead,"" he said.
Airbus is determined to fight back and is holding to its aim of securing a half share of the world passenger plane market by the early part of the next decade. A niche player strategy was doomed to failure, as McDonnell Douglas and Fokker found out, he said.
The consortium needs to field products at the top and bottom end of the range, with respectively the A3XX and a 100-seater plane to be built with China and Singapore, as well as extend the A340 family of long-range jets to compete against Boeing.
"
38,"The French government said on Friday it would reveal early in the New Year how it plans to sell the Thomson-CSF state defence electronics firm and that the sale would be covered by a 1986 privatisation law.
The decision, announced by the finance ministry, makes the sale process slower than if it had been carried out under another 1991 privatisation decree.
The independent Privatisation Commission earlier this month forced the state to rethink its plan to sell the Thomson SA electronics group in a private deal to the Lagardere Groupe conglomerate, when it objected to a key element in the disposal.
Following that setback, the state decided to privatise Thomson SA in two parts, with a sale of Thomson-CSF first, followed by Thomson Multimedia, the loss-making consumer electronics unit, to speed up the process.
But the complex sale details mean any decision will only be made in the beginning of 1997, government officials said.
The Council of State, France's highest administrative court, ruled that the Thomson-CSF sale is covered under the 1986 act, after the government asked it to rule on the legal framework.
The court said that as Thomson-CSF constitutes an essential part of the assets of Thomson SA, the sale should be seen as a means of privatising the parent company, the finance ministry said in a statement.
""The privatisation of Thomson-CSF is covered, just as that of Thomson SA, by chapter II of the law of 6 August 1986 on privatisations,"" it said.
A number of possibilities have emerged for Thomson-CSF since the Privatisation Commission derailed the sale process.
Thomson-CSF's chairman Marcel Roulet and its executive committee have lobbied the Prime Minister Alain Juppe for a stock market flotation instead of selling it to an industrial company such as Lagardere.
A flotation would preserve Thomson-CSF's independence and would be faster than a ""trade sale"", a source close to the firm said. The company has all the financial details to hand and 42 percent of its capital is already traded on the stock market.
Floating Thomson-CSF would allow a faster restructuring of the defence industry, which was the aim of the privatisation move. It could still form alliances with other groups, such as the planned merger between aircraft companies Dassault Aviation and Aerospatiale.
Thomson-CSF wants a ""clean"" flotation, without the traditional cross-shareholding pact which protects companies from hostile takeovers. A flotation would also ensure clarity in the sale terms, a senior source close to Thomson said.
But Lagardere chairman Noel Forgeard argues a flotation could lead to a break up of Thomson-CSF as members of any shareholders pact would want to buy up parts of the business.
"
38,"A two-stage privatisation France's Thomson SA electronics group would allow an early sale of its defence arm and make better economic sense than packaging defence with the loss-making consumer goods unit, stock market analysts said on Monday.
Conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe said in an interview in the London Financial Times on Monday that the military electronics subsidiary Thomson-CSF could be separated from Thomson Multimedia to allow for a speedy privatisation.
The government was forced last week to drop its preferred choice of selling the whole Thomson group to the Lagardere Groupe conglomerate for a symbolic one franc after the independent Privatisation Commission rejected that option.
A break-up of Thomson runs directly against President Jacques Chirac's initial policy announced on February 22 on restructuring the French defence industry and selling Thomson as one unit.
But analysts said the two-part sale made good sense.
""We should have started with that...get on immediately with restructuring the defence industry,"" said an analyst at a French brokerage. ""We can leave Thomson Multimedia (TMM) until 1998.""
A second analyst said, ""It's the privatisation of the Multimedia unit which poses the problem. The industrial logic of the merger between Thomson-CSF and Lagardere has not been criticised by anyone.""
It was Lagardere's plan to sell TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics, while keeping Thomson-CSF, which led the Privatisation Commission to rule out its bid. The Commission objected to planned technology transfers to Daewoo and the lack of binding commitments by Daewoo to retain jobs in France.
Privatising Thomson-CSF separately would meet the state's main aim of creating a defence electronics national champion, and shelve the problems of Thomson Multimedia. CSF is profitable, virtually clean of debt and 42 percent of the capital is quoted on the Paris bourse.
A source close to Thomson-CSF said the firm has not lost any contracts due to the privatisation uncertainty but it has had to run a corporate advertising campaing in countries where it feels its image has suffered.
Lagardere's Matra missile company still looks the favoured candidate for taking over Thomson's defence unit ahead of a rival offer from engineering group Alcatel Alsthom.
""We get the impression that the government wants Lagardere to get Thomson-CSF,"" said one analyst at a brokerage.
An analyst at a French bank said, ""Insofar as the government has made its preference known and is sticking by it, Lagardere seems to be well placed.""
Lagardere has the means to buy Thomson-CSF, without recourse to significant borrowing, one analyst said.
Taking a range of Thomson-CSF share price of between 156 and 200 francs per share, the company has a market capitalisation of between 18 and 24 billion francs ($3.4-4.6 billion), he said.
At the end of 1995 Lagardere had 10 billion francs in tradeable securities, 1.3 billion in free cash and is due to receive three billion in the first half of 1997 when share warrants are due to be exercised. Financial debt was around 8.4 billion.
Lagardere would bring some eight billion francs of Matra's assets in merging with Thomson-CSF, which would reduce the cash it would have to pay. It would however be expected to pay large amounts for goodwill.
Speculation that a vertical integration of missiles, electronics and airframe makers could now be tackled by merging Thomson, Matra, Dassault Aviation and Aerospatiale did not stand up to scrutiny, analysts said.
Combat plane maker Dassault is expected to be absorbed by the larger, civilian-aircraft manufacturer Aerospatiale as part of the defence industry consolidation. But as Aerospatiale is state-owned and the government still wants to privatise Thomson, that course seemed to be excluded, an industry executive said.
Economy ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. ($1=5.244 French Franc)

38,"The four partners of the Airbus consortium on Monday signed an agreement aimed at making the European plane maker a unified company better able to compete with Boeing Co.
In a statement, Airbus Industrie said its four European partners had signed a memorandum of understanding to restructure Airbus into a limited liability company by 1999.
""The establishment of Airbus Industrie as a single corporate entity (SCE) is an important initial step in the consolidation of the aerospace industry within Europe,"" Airbus said.
Toulouse-based Airbus is currently a partnership between French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace(DASA), and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA(CASA) of Spain.
The French and Germans both have 37.9 percent, the British 20 percent and Spanish company 4.2 percent.
The new entity will have a single management structure which should add control of engineering, testing, production, procurement and customer service to Airbus's current responsibilities for marketing, sales and product support, it said in a statement.
""Transfer of assets associated with these functions... will depend on how far the assets are essential for the described functions and their detailed valuation, to be completed by the end of 1997,"" it said.
""The ultimate objective is the restructring of the entire European (aerospace) industry, of which Airbus in one element and not the integrating entity,"" Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michot told the Le Monde newspaper.
""Airbus will be made a single company before the end of 1999 with a shareholding strictly the same as now,"" he added
Currently Airbus is mainly a sales and marketing organisation with the four partners manufacturing the planes.
Airbus first announced a preliminary agreement in early January. The four partners decided last July to turn Airbus into a corporation to streamline decision-making and production.
These restructuring plans took on a more urgent tone after Boeing and McDonnell Douglas said in December they would merge and form a civil and military giant with nearly $50 billion in annual sales.
Airbus said in its statement that the restructured company would facilitate continuing improvement in overall operational efficiency, the introduction of new international strategic partnerships and the longer term opportunity for ""external participation"" in Airbus.
Airbus spokesman Robert Alizart said that these options included a future stock market listing of Airbus.
Airbus said that the restructured company ""presented a great opportunity for business growth both for its existing shareholders and its future partners.""
It said Airbus was studying expansion of its product range with an aircraft in the 100 seat category, with Alenia  ALEI.RO of Itlay in co-operartion with AVIC of China and Singapore Aerospace.
It is also mulling derivatives of the four-engined A340, the A340-500 with a range of 8,300 nautical miles and the A340-600 with seating capacity of close to 400 seats.
In the high-capacity long haul market it is planning to launch the A3XX, which would break the stranglehold on the lucrative top-end of the market now held by Boeing's 747 jumbo jet.
Airbus is also pondering work on the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), a military transport aircraft to match the future needs of Europe, next to its civil work.
British Aerospace said it expected its wing development and production operations, employing more than 4,000 people, to be transferred to Airbus.

38,"French subscriber television company Canal Plus said on Friday it was merging with Nethold, a Dutch satellite television company, to create one of the world's largest pay-TV groups.
Nethold is jointly held by Richemont SA, which is quoted on the Zurich and Johannesburg stock exchanges, and MIH Holdings Ltd, a listed holding company.
""This merger is a major strategic move, resulting in the creation of one of the largest television groups in the world...particularly in the field of pay-TV with over 8.5 million subscribers,"" Canal Plus said in a statement.
The new group will have significant positions in France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, the Benelux countries and Germany as well as a presence in several growing markets in central Europe.
The Paris stockmarket authorities had suspended trading in Canal Plus shares on Friday morning, sparking speculation of a link up between the French firm and Nethold.
Its stock closed at 1,169 francs on Thursday.
Utilities group Cie Generale des Eaux, a key shareholder in Canal Plus, said in a separate statement it was delighted with the merger plan, which marked big step in Canal Plus's international development.
The pact would give the French company access to the fast-growing Italian market, Generale des Eaux said.
It would also give the new group greater weight in negotiating purchases of copyrights and open opportunities for the launch of European theme channels.
Generale des Eaux said it was comfortable with its investment in Canal Plus. It said that in agreement with other Canal Plus shareholders, it would seek to maintain the same scale of investment in the new company.
Under the terms of the deal, Canal Plus will buy 100 percent of Nethold from Richemont and MIH, paying with 6.1 million new Canal Plus shares and $45 million in cash.
Following the issue of new Canal Plus shares, Richemont and MIH will respectively own 15 and five percent of Canal Plus.
Cie Financiere Richemont has interests in luxury goods and tobacco and owns such famous brandnames as Cartier, Mont Blanc, Rothmans and Dunhill.
Canal Plus said the deal had the backing of its main shareholders, media group Havas, Generale des Eaux, bank Societe Generale, and state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations.
It is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.

38,"Some 120 Eurotunnel SA /Plc employees are working round the clock to clear wreckage from the Channel Tunnel, devastated by a fire two weeks ago which has halted passenger services on the undersea link between Britain and France .
Reporters visiting the tunnel on Tuesday viewed a nightmarish scene of flame-scarred concrete where intense heat had blown apart the surface cladding to expose steel reinforcing cables embedded in slabs.
A blaze on a truck-carrying wagon on December 18 forced Eurotunnel to close the tunnel to Eurostar high-speed passenger trains and tourist vehicle Shuttle services just before the Christmas season. Partial freight traffic has been resumed.
Eurotunnel hopes to run two thirds of normal passenger and freight traffic in the estimated three to six months necessary for repairs to be completed, Eurotunnel spokesman Francois Borel said.
""We are going to make a new tunnel,"" he said.
But before repairs can begin, the wreckage must be cleared.
With scorched rubble underfoot and ghostly streams of melted grey fibre glass filaments overhead, maintenance workers in four shifts of six hours are shovelling out ashes and debris, all that is left of 28 trucks caught in the fire.
The Eurotunnel official coordinating the clearance, Dominique Dorso, said three wagons remained where the fire started, in section five of the tunnel. One was being removed Tuesday evening and the other two should be taken out next week.
The fire was so intense in one 30-metre stretch that no visible traces of the trucks themselves remained in the Shuttle wagons, which were themselves reduced to blackened and twisted steel lattice frames.
Chunks exploded off the first 40-cm thick concrete layer which makes up the the Tunnel wall but the fire did not penetrate to the underlying 20-30 cm of injected concrete which lines the link. Behind that second layer is chalk.
Two weeks on, the smell of burnt plastic and metal still permeates the air and protective masks are obligatory.
Once the debris is cleared , the Anglo-French consortium which built the Tunnel, Transmanche Link (TML), can start repairs to the five or six affected kilometres of the link, putting in new cladding, cabling and conductor rails.
Eurotunnel hopes to use intersections linking the two tunnel bores to bypass the damaged section and allow trains to run between Britain and France during repairs, he said.
Tight security surrounds the entry points to the tunnel bores. There are three separate checkpoints before workers can even enter the narrow central service tunnel, which was used for the evacuation on the night of the fire, and is routinely used by maintenance crews.
Specially-built Mercedes vehicles, high and narrow, are used to transport personnel along the service tunnel. It is not a trip for claustrophobics. Once the overhead lights are out, the grey strip of tunnel extends into the darkness ahead, with only the headlights for illumination. Overhead are tonnes of rock and the Channel waters.

25,"Apple Computer Inc. Chairman Gilbert Amelio will outline a long-awaited plan Tuesday to revamp the Macintosh personal computer with the help of recently acquired Next Software Inc.
At the Macworld trade show here next week, Apple and dozens of other vendors also will unveil new products that could help boost the Macintosh market in 1997, analysts said.
This year's show will be more cheery than last year's, when Apple's future as an independent company was in doubt, customers and vendors said. In 1996, Apple's new management under Amelio stopped huge financial losses and acted quickly to come up with a plan to update the Mac.
""We're very pleased with the decisions Apple has made with the future of the Mac,"" said Bob Roblin, senior vice president of marketing at Adobe Systems Inc., one of the biggest suppliers of Mac software.
""It's going to be a much more upbeat show, but one where a lot of questions have to be answered.""
The questions swirl around Apple's agreement last month to pay $400 million for Next, the company run by Apple co-founder Steven Jobs.
Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., plans to take Next's well-regarded operating system -- a type of program that controls the basic functions of a computer -- and meld it with the Mac operating system. The Mac's fundamental software needs an overhaul to keep up with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows family of software.
While Apple management has outlined the Next strategy, Macintosh programmers and executives of Mac-related companies said they still needed lots of technical details before they could start working on new products.
""As a user, I want to know what this means for the interface, for the functionality, for my existing software,"" said Phil Schuller, vice president of product management at Macromedia Inc., a developer of graphics software.
Other highlights of Macworld are expected to be the release of new versions of several key Macintosh products.
Adobe officials said they will announce plans to start shipping later this month the latest version of PageMaker, which helps graphic artists design and compose magazines and newspapers and is one of the best-selling Mac programs.
Microsoft will unveil its long-awaited Internet Explorer browser for the Mac at the show, a company spokesman said.
Apple itself will announce plans to re-enter the online service business. It plans a World Wide Web site, dubbed Apple Club, where subscribers can download Mac software. An annual subscription will cost $19.95, an Apple spokeswoman said.
In 1996, Apple pulled the plug on eWorld, its first foray into the online business.
"
25,"Tandem Computer Inc on Wednesday will become the latest maker of high-end, proprietary computers to introduce a line of machines based on personal computer technology.
Tandem, which specializes in making transaction-processing computers for banks and stock exchanges, said it will unveil a line of servers based on Intel Corp's Pentium Pro microprocessors and Microsoft Corp's Windows NT networking operating system.
The servers -- which are computers souped up to control the flow of information through a network -- will include some of Tandem's technology for handling huge volumes of transactions, the company said. Tandem plans to pitch the machines to customers who want to set up shop on the Internet.
The machines are Tandem's first step to rely less on sales of computers based on its own proprietary software and technology.
Banks, telephone companies and stock exchanges still rely heavily on Tandem's so-called fault-tolerant computers for their heavy-duty computing.
But Tandem's sales growth has stalled in recent years as its customers have replaced some of its machines with networks of cheaper computers from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc and Compaq Computer Corp.
To strike back, Tandem unveiled a strategy earlier this year that includes making servers based on off-the-shelf technology from Intel and Microsoft.
Other high-end computer makers, such as International Business Machines Corp and Digital Equipment Corp, embarked on similar strategies years ago.
With its new machines, Tandem plans to help its existing customers set up networks based on Microsoft's Windows NT networking software, said Chris Rooke, Tandem's vice president of corporate marketing.
""We expect Tandem to now be on our customers' vendor list when they're looking at using Windows NT in more business- critical applications,"" Rooke said. ""Yes, we do expect to open new accounts, but we expect to still be Fortune 500-class customers.""
Rooke said Tandem will concentrate on selling the machines as foundations for businesses that want to sell their wares online.
Tandem also plans on Wednesday to unveil a new line of its Himalaya servers, a line of proprietary servers for storing and retrieving huge libraries of corporate information.
Rooke declined to discuss the pricing of its new lines.

25,"Apple Computer Inc. ( stunned investors Wednesday by reporting an unexpected $25 million profit for the last three months of its fiscal year.
The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker, which had been expected to report a loss of 30 cents a share, posted a profit of 20 cents a share, its first quarterly profit this year.
In the same quarter a year ago, Apple had net income of $60 million, or 12 cents. Included in the most recent quarter's operating results was a gain of $17 million.
Fourth-quarter revenue for fiscal 1996 declined 23 percent to $2.32 billion from $3 billion.
Apple released the news after the market closed and Its shares jumped as much as $4.25 to $30 a share in after-hours trading.
The profit came because of Apple's aggressive cost cutting, a bigger-than-expected exodus of employees and lower prices for key components, such as memory chips, analysts said.
""It is a shock,"" said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at JP Morgan in San Francisco who was expecting a loss. ""It seems they've brought the break-even point for their business down pretty dramatically. This is very encouraging.""
Most important to investors, Apple could remain profitable in coming quarters, which would bolster confidence among consumers that it will be around for years and keep loyal customers from switching to IBM-compatible personal computers, analysts said.
Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, stopped short of predicting a profit in the first fiscal quarter.
He said, however, that he expects the company's costs to increase only slightly in the December quarter on higher advertising expenses and that first-quarter revenue should be about the same as in the fourth fiscal quarter.
""We continue to make progress in strengthening Apple's financial condition, as our $410 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter suggests,"" Anderson said.
""We've reduced inventories by nearly $400 million since June and completed the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments,"" he said in a statement.
In the past three quarter, Apple reported huge losses because of declining Macintosh sales, management turmoil and growing popularity of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows software, which compete with Macintosh.
The company began slashing its costs when former National Semiconductor Corp. chief Gilbert Amelio took charge of Apple in February.
With most of the cost-cutting plan completed, Apple now will concentrate on the much tougher task of increasing revenue, Anderson said.
While shipments were down 26 percent in the fourth quarter to 932,000 units from the year-ago quarter, Apple said shipments were up 11 percent from the third quarter, a sign that customers were once again buying Apple's products.
Apple has a slew of new products in the works.
On Monday, the company is expected to unveil a new low-end PowerBook, a much-needed portable computer to replace Apple's older glitch-prone models.
In the first calendar quarter, the company also is expected to introduce new low-end consumer desktop models, a niche from which Apple had retreated in an effort to cut costs.
For the full year, Apple reported a loss of $816 million, or $6.59 a share, reflecting a series of hefty one-time charges for inventory writedowns and restructurings. In fiscal 1995, Apple earned $424 million, or $3.45 a share.
Revenue for the year fell 11 percent to $9.83 billion from $11.1 billion a year ago.
"
25,"Apple Computer Inc. Chairman Gilbert Amelio said Tuesday the computer maker's three-year turnaround plan was still on track despite its statement last week that it will report a first-quarter operating loss of as much as $150 million.
Amelio, speaking to thousands of Macintosh computer enthusiasts at the MacWorld trade show here also called on several star computer industry executives to express their support for the Macintosh.
In his much-anticipated keynote speech, Amelio assured Mac customers the company will have a smooth transition as Apple shores up its finances and overhauls the fundamental software of the Macintosh.
""We will encounter a few bumps on the way, but I don't want that to shake your confidence,"" Amelio told Macintosh customers and software developers. ""We are sticking to our strategy.""
Apple has been struggling for the past year to stop huge financial losses, develop new software to make the Mac more modern and increase revenues. Under Apple's three year plan, it aims to stop financial losses in 1996, develop new products in 1997 and increase revenues in 1998.
Since Amelio became chairman of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company a year ago, he has slashed costs. In December, Apple also agreed to buy NeXT Software Inc. for $400 million to get its help in revamping the fundamental software of the Mac.
In order to move developers smoothly from Apple's current operating system to the new system, Apple said it plans to continue to deliver regularly scheduled upgrades to the current system while accelerating development of a new and advanced operating system.
The new operating system, code-named ""Rhapsody,"" will be based on the merging of technologies from Apple and NeXT.
""Our goal is to be one of the world's strongest brands for consumer, education and the enterprise,"" Apple co-founder and Next Software President Steven Jobs said, adding Apple hoped to rely on Next's multimedia and computing intensive software to accomplish that goal.
Apple said Friday it expected to report a loss from operations of $100 million to $150 million because of weak sales of its Performa line of Macintosh computers. Revenue for the company's first quarter ended Dec. 27 is expected to drop 10 percent from the $2.3 billion reported in the September quarter.
Amelio blamed the shortfall on weak consumer sales for personal computers rather than a breakdown of Apple's strategy.
""We had one thing that really fell out of bed in a big way and that is, Santa Claus forgot to come,"" he said, referring to the surprisingly low sales of its Performa desktop PC line aimed at consumers.
The first quarter ""was about retail sales, not about the fundamentals in the recovery of Apple,"" Amelio told a packed ballroom.
Industry experts say part of the blame for declining revenue falls on the perception that there is not as much software for the Macintosh as there is for PCs running Windows software from Microsoft Corp..
To boost the Mac's image, Amelio turned to executives from Microsoft, Sun Microsystems Inc., and Netscape Communications Corp. to announce software plans for future versions of the Mac.
""We see great opportunities for the Mac in the future,"" said Paul Maritz, Microsoft vice president in charge of application development.
At Macworld, Microsoft introduced its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.
The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant, which has often battled Apple for control of the PC industry, also said it created a new product unit responsible for design and development of a Macintosh version of its widely used Microsoft Office software suite.
While Microsoft remains Apple's great nemesis in the operating systems software business, Microsoft also has long served as the leading independent developer of software applications that run on Apple Macintosh computers.
""When Apple's biggest third-party developer decides to commit new resources to its Macintosh applications business, that's a pretty clear sign that there's still money to be made in the Macintosh market,"" said Jeffrey Tarter, an industry analyst and publisher of Soft*Letter.
The creation of the new Macintosh product unit, part of the Microsoft desktop applications division, marks the first time in the history of the division that an entire product unit has focused exclusively on the Macintosh, Microsoft said.
James Barksdale, chief executives of Internet software vendor Netscape, also said his company will release versions of its communication software within the next few weeks that will run on Apple's next-generation operating system.
Apple's stock closed down 37.5 cents at $17.50 on Nasdaq.
"
25,"Apple Computer Inc.'s expected loss of $100 to $150 million in its fiscal first quarter is a serious setback to the company's unfolding comeback plan, industry analysts said on Saturday.
Apple was banking on a strong Christmas season this year to convince potential customers there are still plenty of people using the Macintosh and plenty of people willing to write software for it, analysts said.
The company also had hoped to show software developers there would be enough demand for their products while Apple engineers finish a major overhaul of the Mac's fundamental software with the help of recently acquired Next Software Inc.
But the loss shows Apple is having a much tougher time selling its PC than analysts expected.
""I can't tell you how many people have asked me about whether they should be buying from Apple when there's so much negative news out there,"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, an analyst at market researcher International Data Corp.
In the September quarter, Apple's share of the PC market worldwide fell to 5.4 percent from 8.7 percent in the same quarter a year ago, according to a recent Apple filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the U.S., its share fell to 7.3 percent from 13.2 percent.
Apple on Friday blamed a shortage of PowerBook laptops and slow sales of its Performa line -- which is geared toward home users -- for the shortfall. Consumer sales traditionally account for 40 percent of Apple's Christmas quarter.
Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 27 will be about 10 percent less than the $2.3 billion reported in the September quarter, Apple said.
Meanwhile, Apple faces more technological competition from PCs based on Intel Corp. Pentium microprocessors. Intel will release in a few weeks a new Pentium with so-called MMX technology that can handle computer graphics and sounds much better than before.
Tim Bajarin, president of market research firm Creative Strategies International Corp., said some consumers may have put off buying Macintosh Performas -- until now, a favored brand for running multimedia software -- in favor of waiting for PCs based on Intel's MMX chips.
""It is an image problem,"" Bajarin said. ""Apple has not been able to convince the consumer that the software developers are coming back, and has not been able to convince them that Apple will be around in the future.""
Not counting the $400 million purchase of Next, Apple expects to report a loss of $100 million to $150 million, the company said. Based on Apple's 123.7 million shares outstanding, the loss would be about $0.80 to $1.21 a share.
Wall Street expected Apple to report a per-share loss of $0.04, according to a survey of analysts by First Call.
The expected loss puts pressure on Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who on Tuesday will outline his company's strategy to thousands of Macintosh customers and programmers at the Macworld trade show.
Amelio said on Friday the company would have to reduce its expenses by about $1 billion to $8 billion annually, to return to profit, a move that could include another round of firings.
Last year, the company laid off about 1,300 people.
In recent speeches Amelio said he did not expect the company's revenue to grow until 1998, but other executives have said they expected the company to have ""sustainable profits"" by the end of the March quarter.
While it is too early to forecast the March quarter's results, Apple is ""telling people to recalibrate their expectations,"" David Harrah, corporate public relations director, said.
"
25,"Apple Computer Inc. Friday agreed to acquire NeXT Software Inc. for $400 million, a stunning move that reunites the computer company with its co-founder, Steven Jobs.
The acquisition will give Apple the software technology it needs to revamp the Macintosh personal computer, which has lost much of its technological luster to PCs running software from Microsoft Corp.
""The Mac has provided the innovation that the industry has been feeding off for the last 10 years,"" Jobs said. ""It's time for someone to come up with innovation to drive the industry forward. Who better than Apple?""
Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said the company will pay $350 million, mostly in cash and a little stock, for Redwood City, Calif.-based NeXT. Apple also will pay off NeXT's $50 million debt.
Jobs, who founded Apple with a friend in his garage 20 years ago, led Apple through its early years until he was fired by the company's board in 1985.
Apple said he will come back to Apple part-time to lead an effort to rewrite the fundamental software of the Macintosh. He will report to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.
Apple will base much of its next-generation operating system -- the computer program that controls the basic function of the Mac -- on Nextstep.
NeXT's technology will not only provide many of the software bells and whistles that Apple needs to compete with Microsoft's Windows, but will attract outside software companies to write more titles for the Mac, Amelio said.
""Without question, the technology at NeXT was the superior technology, by a significant amount,"" Amelio said.
Apple had been for months looking outside for help after having abandoned an unfinished operating system code-named ""Copland.""
The company looked at operating system technology and multimedia software from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and closely held Be Inc.
Amelio said with NeXT's existing technology, he hopes Apple will have a new operating system in 1997.
For Jobs, the cheerleader who instilled an attitude in Apple that the company was out to change the world, the merger is another stop in a strange odyssey.
After being fired by his successor John Sculley in 1985, he left to found NeXT, which initially made a line of whiz-bang computers.
When NeXT ran into financial trouble in the late 1980s, the company dropped its computers to concentrate on software. In the past two years, NeXT has been selling a line of reasonably successful software for creating sites on the Internet's World Wide Web.
Meanwhile, Jobs helped co-found Pixar Animation Studios, a production studio that uses powerful computers instead of drawings. The company made last year's hit ""Toy Story.""
Jobs said he will continue to run Pixar.
"
25,"Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in its fiscal first quarter and warned investors it did not expect to report a profit until September.
The troubled computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it expected revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends next September, to drop about 13 percent to $8 billion to $8.5 billion because of weak consumer sales.
Apple's loss, which equaled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.
Apple attributed the latest quarterly loss to slow sales of consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the crucial Christmas quarter, which analysts said was partly due to concerns about Apple's future.
""Apple's been under a black cloud, and part of it has been Apple's doing,"" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. ""It's hard for a consumer to get the gumption to buy a Performa when everyone's asking, 'Is Apple dead yet?'""
Apple officials said the company will unveil in coming weeks its second restructuring program in two years, aimed at cutting operating costs by $400 million.
The plan could include more job cuts, Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said. Apple wants to reduce its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues to enable it to return to profitability by the end of September.
Previously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March. But industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.
Apple, which posted a record loss last year of $816 million, has been struggling to return to profitability in the face of increased competition from computers using Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and Intel Corp.'s computer chips.
Last February, Apple replaced Chief Executive Michael Spindler with National Semiconductor Corp. boss Gilbert Amelio and then, in December, announced a reunion with former co-founder Steven Jobs when it agreed to acquire Job's Next Software Inc. for $400 million.
Meanwhile, debt rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's lowered Apple's corporate credit and debt rating another notch Wednesday, putting the company's debt further into junk bond status.
The rating agency said the downgrade reflected the challenges facing Apple, including reducing costs and restoring revenue growth, executing a cohesive operating system upgrade upon completion of the Next acquisition, and Apple's diminished liquidity and financial resources.
""Despite its position among the top five worldwide personal computer manufacturers ... Apple has been struggling with extremely competitive industry conditions, slipping market share, and operating losses,"" the rating agency said.
Despite the slowdown in Performa sales, Anderson said Apple's financial position remained strong.
""While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,"" he said. ""We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash.""
Anderson said there were some bright spots in its results. European shipments rose 50 percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. Sales to educational organizations also were above the company's goals, Anderson said.
Still, Performa sales, which account for about a third of Apple's revenues, will be weak for the rest of the year. ""We had a major problem in this one product area,"" he said.
Analysts said the loss, which Apple forecast two weeks ago, represented a setback for Amelio. He had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996 and getting revenue growing again by 1998.
News of the latest loss can drive even more consumers to avoid buying Apple products, analysts said.
""The question is, can Apple wait until 1998 to get its growth engine going again?"" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at broker PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
Apple reported its results after the market closed. Apple closed at $17.25 a share, down 62.5 cents, on Nasdaq.
"
25,"Apple Computer Inc. will unveil Monday a new family of portable PowerBook computers to fill a critical gap in its product line.
The new PowerBook 1400 family, scheduled to be sold in mid-November with prices starting at $2,500, will feature a built-in CD-ROM drive and a bigger screen. The models are designed to appeal to small office users and students, Apple said.
Until now, the lack of a CD-ROM drive in its portables has held back Apple in competing with offerings from International Business Machines Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., analysts said.
The new family ""isn't going to put them in the leadership role, but it's going to get them back in the game,"" said Bruce Steven, an analyst at market researcher International Data Corp.
Apple said it also plans to introduce another new series of PowerBooks in the first half of the 1997 with more advanced multimedia and communication capabilities. The company did not release any more specifications.
Apple has been scrambling to retool the PowerBook line. The predecessor to the new model, the PowerBook 5300, was recalled last spring because of several defects including a faulty AC power connector and a display casing that could easily crack.
The PowerBook 1400 will replace that family. The new machines will be based on a mid-range PowerPC microprocessor.
The faster microprocessor, the CD-ROM drive and bigger screen make the 1400 comparable in price and performance to top-selling models from other vendors, but the 1400 will have a tough time competing with low-priced offerings from second-tier PC manufacturers, Steven said.
Based on the memory, screen options and disk-drive size, the 1400 models will sell for an estimated $2,500 to $4,000 retail in the United States, an Apple spokeswoman said.
The entry-level model will not have the internal CD-ROM drive, she said.
Although the machines will go on sale in mid-November, there will be a limited supply on some models until after the New Year, she said.
"
25,"Apple Computer Inc.'s rehiring of company co-founder Steve Jobs and purchase of NeXT Software Inc. will give it a much-needed operating system, but analysts warned Monday the deal might not be enough to boost the computer maker's market share or bottom line.
""(The move) has a lot of PR value, but it looks to me that the company still has a strategic mess on its hand with $400 million less,"" said John Rossi, an analyst at the Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. brokerage in San Francisco.
Apple said Friday it would pay $400 million to buy NeXT and rehire NeXT founder Jobs, Apple's mercurial co-founder, as part of a plan to revamp the Macintosh computer.
Apple bought NeXT because it needs an operating system -- the program that controls a computer's basic functions -- after its own attempt failed.
While NeXT's existing technology helps Apple make up for lost time and provides a decent foundation for a new operating system, the technology is not dazzling enough to set the Macintosh apart from computers running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software, analysts said.
""Trying to prop up the brand name with a psychological hire is not going to solve Apple's problems,"" said one Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified.
Analysts note that NeXT has failed to make any dent in the consumer computer market on its own. The company sold only 50,000 computers in four years as a hardware manufacturer before it focused entirely on software.
Some analysts also are disappointed that Apple chose NeXT over Be Inc., a closely held software company founded by another former Apple executive, Jean-Louis Gassee.
""I saw Be's technology. I was wowed by it,"" Rossi said. Be had many features that would have appealed to Macintosh customers, who do a lot of graphics design, video and image editing and desktop publishing. NeXT, Rossi said, ""is aged"" in comparison.
Still, Apple needed to come up with a technological blueprint to persuade outside software companies not to abandon the Macintosh.
By making no secret they were shopping around for technology, Apple's management had essentially told their customers the current Macintosh system was a dead end, analysts said.
If Apple had taken much longer to present its plan, Macintosh software developers would have begun to look for other ways to make a living.
""The technology direction implicit in the acquisition is a good one,"" said Ike Nassi, a former Apple executive and computer scientist who headed the software development effort.
Some investors agreed. Apple shares rose 12.5 cents to $23.625 in afternoon Nasdaq trading. The shares jumped $1.25 to $23.50 Friday as word spread of Apple's decision to buy NeXT, based in Redwood City, Calif.
Analysts said they may have to wait months to get a clearer picture from Apple about what the combination of NeXT and Apple software will look like.
""Merging operating systems is not a simple task,"" said Peter Andrew, an analyst at brokerage AG Edwards.
And it is still unclear where Apple will get the software expertise to include key features in the new operating system.
For example, neither Apple nor NeXT's software is efficient at handling several tasks simultaneously, such as recalculating a spreadsheet while faxing a document and updating stock quotes on the screen.
""There are many issues about how the NeXT operating system can revitalize the Mac,"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, an analyst at market researcher International Data Corp.
Apple executives are expected to give more technological details about their plan Jan. 7 at the MacWorld trade show in San Francisco.
Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with investment bank JP Morgan's San Francisco office, said Jobs, even if he helps Apple comes up with a brilliant operating system quickly, cannot save Apple alone.
""My investment thesis on Apple hinges on a lot of mileposts,"" including reporting a decent Christmas quarter this year and revamping its entire product line in 1997, Kunstler said. Finding an operating system was just one milepost, he said.
""The PC industry is one of the most dynamic and competitive in the world, and this announcement underscores that fact,"" said Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray. ""We look forward to watching their efforts and competing in the marketplace.""
He pointed out that Microsoft has been the biggest developer of applications for the Macintosh platform over the past 15 years.
""Until Apple provides more details on their future plans, it's going to be hard for anyone to say how they will partner with or support this new venture,"" he said. But he added that Microsoft would take a ""hard look"" at any new system, depending on customer demand.

25,"Intuit Inc. shares jumped 24 percent Wednesday amid market speculation that American Express Co. is about to buy the struggling financial management software company.
Shares of Intuit, which publishes the best-selling Quicken personal finance computer program, surged $7 to close at $36.50 on Nasdaq. American Express rose 12.5 cents to $48.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Officials of both companies declined to comment about ""market rumors,"" and an Intuit spokeswoman called the speculation ""wild.""
Analysts said American Express, the charge card and financial services company, would be interested in buying Intuit to enable it to jump into the booming online banking industry.
Intuit, analysts said, might be receptive to an offer because of increasing doubts about its future.
Even if American Express is not interested in acquiring Intuit, other companies may be, analysts said.
More than 9 million people, most of them affluent, use Intuit's Quicken to manage their finances and do their banking chores through their personal computers.
But Intuit's growth has stalled amid fierce competition with Microsoft Corp., a one-time suitor of Intuit, and a handful of banks which are offering online banking to their customers through the Internet.
""Intuit is staring down the barrel of a gun, and that gun is the Internet, which is making financial management easier,"" said Karen Epper, an online banking analyst at market researcher Forrester Research Inc in Cambridge, Mass.
Until two years ago, Intuit relied heavily on sales of its financial and tax software for its growth. Those sales have slowed as Intuit has cut prices.
Intuit also faces renewed competition from Microsoft, which tried to buy it in 1994. Microsoft dropped the acquisition in May 1995 because of opposition from government antitrust officials.
Since then, Microsoft, the world's biggest PC software company has spent hundreds of millions to take on Intuit.
To fuel its growth, Intuit set up a business two years ago to process online banking transactions between banks and depositors. Some investors saw the transaction business as a promising source of growth.
In September, however, Intuit sold its transaction processing unit, Intuit Services Corp., to rival CheckFree Corp.
Epper said Intuit's biggest challenge is figuring out how to grow. She said the company needs the backing of a bank or bigger computer company to fuel expansion into any new business.

33,"New Corp. Ltd. said Tuesday that its Fox News division will file suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court here against Time Warner Inc., Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and its Chairman Ted Turner, alleging antitrust violations.
News Corp., which is led by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said the suit will allege that an antitrust conspiracy to block Fox News Channel in New York City has taken place prior to the still-to-be consummated merger.
""The suit will allege that the conspiracy has taken place prior to the still-to-be-consummated merger,"" Arthur Siskind, News Corp. Group General Counsel, said in a brief statement. ""The suit also charges Time Warner with breach of contract and fraud in reneging on its agreement to carry Fox News in New York City.""
Locked in a bitter campaign to win New York channel space for its Fox News service, News Corp. on Monday urged city officials to void cable-TV franchises with Time Warner Inc.
News Corp. executives told city officials at a hearing that the pending merger of Time Warner and Turner constituted a change of control of Time Warner's cable systems in New York City and allowed early rebidding for the valuable franchises.
Time Warner holds city cable-television franchises serving 1.2 millions New Yorkers that are due to expire in 1998.
Time Warner, which denies the merger constitutes a change in management control, has refused to carry the 24-hour Fox News service and instead carries two Cable News Network services owned by Turner, and MSNBC, a joint venture of General Electric Co.'s NBC and Microsoft Corp.
Turner and Time Warner are expected to merge on Thursday, creating the world's biggest media organisation. Turner Chairman Ted Turner will become vice chairman of the new company and will be the company's biggest shareholder.
Time Warner is also opposing a proposal backed by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that Fox News be carried on a city-owned channel known as CrossWalks.
Giulani has said that wide dissemination of Fox News throughout New York was important since it was the only all-news channel based within the city and was the source of hundreds of jobs.
The city's Franchise Concession and Review Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether or not the Turner-Time Warner deal should prompt a review of the Time Warner franchises.
Time Warner executive Richard Aurelio said Monday that 90 percent of the regulators overseeing Time Warner's cable operations, the second largest in the United States, had passed without objection on the Turner-Time Warner merger.

33,"Florida is stepping up anti-smoking efforts by barring cigarette promotions on state roads, forcing Marlboro to drop its name from thousands of banners promoting the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami motor race.
New rules detailing limits on using banners to promote sports events, to be published on Friday, are due to take effect in early March, a Florida Department of Transportation official said.
Banners for beer, tobacco and other products meant for adults are covered by the new rules. Promoters can place a product name on the banners but cannot use type faces, logos and colours associated with the banned products.
""Most sporting events have a corporate name attached to them and that name would be allowed,"" said department spokeswoman Lynn Holschuh. ""But if it's a product that can't be sold to minors, the banner can't contain logos or significant advertising promoting the product.""
Advertising on billboards, often located on private property, will not be affected by the new rules covering state roadways, the official said. The rules do not affect municipal, Interstate and other roads maintained by other governments.
In Miami, an IndyCar-class grand prix site since 1983, thousands of coloured banners no longer bear the Marlboro name, even though the Feb. 4 to March 2 competition is officially called the Marlboro Miami Grand Prix presented by Toyota.
Banners for the event say simply, Grand Prix of Miami presented by Toyota.
Last year's banners carried the distinctive red colour and bold typface of Marlboro, the most popular cigarette in the United States.
A spokeswoman for Philip Morris Cos. Inc., maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said the company had chosen to drop the Marlboro name from the banners as a courtesy. State officials, including anti-tobacco activist Gov. Lawton Chiles, complained about the Marlboro signs last year.
""We will have signage and merchandise and cigarettes for sale to people 21 and over at the site,"" said Philip Morris spokeswoman Tara Carraro. ""We really want to reach smokers choosing brands.""
Marlboro, which along with RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is a major sponsor of motorsports events, will back other IndyCar events this year in California, Ohio, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Such sponsorships are major promotional outlets for the U.S. tobacco industry, with the top two producers spending $50 million or more each year on motorsports sponsorships, according to the IEG Sponsorship Report newsletter.
Marlboro spent about $19 million on motorsport sponsorships and likely as much again on related advertising and promotion during 1996, according to David Jacobsen, senior editor at IEG.
Cigarette advertising has been banned since the 1960s from U.S. television and steadily driven from sponsoring many other sports. The industry now faces still stricter federal government limits on promoting its products.
The federal rules, the first of which are to take effect on Feb. 28, sharply curtail cigarette advertising near schools and playgrounds and in publications favoured by people under 18.
A spokesman for the National Centre for Tobacco Free Kids, an anti-smoking group, said Florida's roadway ban was unusual. Some local transit systems, in San Francisco and elsewhere, have dropped tobacco advertising, he said.
A spokesman for Chiles, who is spearheading a billion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry and advocating new state taxes on cigarettes, described him as pleased by the Marlboro's decision to take its name off the Miami race banners.

33,"BellSouth Corp will expand by a third its network of wireless-telephony shops in a campaign to cut the nearly $400 it spends acquiring each new customer, chief financial officer Ronald Dykes said on Thursday.
The company operates 200 or more of its own outlets selling BellSouth Mobility cellular-telephone services and finds it saves about $100 on each customer signed up by its own representatives.
""I wouldn't be surprised if the number grew by a third,"" Dykes told Reuters.  
BellSouth has 3.3 million U.S. cellular customers, a total rising at the rate of 31 percent a year. It also has more than one million cellular customers in 11 other nations.
Dykes said BellSouth, a leading regional telephone group, expects the share of wireless customers secured through its directly owned shops to rise but never to replace its direct-sales force or third-party vendors.
""We want to have a very broad distribution system and drive the costs down,"" he said.  
BellSouth also sells in select markets personal communications services (PCS), a new generation of wireless telephony which uses spectra other than the 800 megahertz reserved for cellular, but intends to keep the BellSouth Mobility brand for both PCS and cellular.
""The customer doesn't care,"" he said. ""We are using PCS to fill out our footprint"", or areas in its region where it does not have cellular rights.  
Marketing, he said, also played an important role in the 43 percent spurt in quarterly revenues from convenience telephone features BellSouth sells to traditional wired telephone customers.
Quarterly revenues for such services rose to $281 million in the third quarter, when net income rose 12.9 percent to $631 million.
Selling such services as Call Waiting, a feature which signals a customer using a telephone that a second caller is ringing, in discounted bundles or on a per-use basis had lifted sales mightily.
""Those two methods are very strong drivers of our success,"" Dykes said.
Per-use sales of such services totalled $53 million in the first nine months of 1996, he said.

33,"Sunbeam Corp., the struggling appliance maker led by corporate turnaround specialist Albert Dunlap, said Tuesday it would cut 6,000 jobs -- half its work force -- and eliminate 87 percent of its product lines.
The drastic measures, even more severe than Wall Street had expected, were announced just four months after Dunlap -- known as ""Chainsaw Al"" for his deep cost-cutting at troubled companies -- became chairman.
The maker of Sunbeam and Oster appliances, patio furniture and gas grills, which just reported its first quarterly loss since 1992, said it would also reduce the number of its facilities to 14 from 53 and take a charge of $300 million for one-time costs associated with the moves.
The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based firm, which lost $28.7 million in the third quarter as sales fell 2 percent, did not specify when the charge would be taken.
It did say, however, that only $75 million of the charge would be in cash -- for the payment of severance and other employee costs, lease obligations and other plant costs.
Sunbeam also announced ambitious plans for the future. It said it plans to double revenues to $2 billion by 1999 and lift operating margins to 20 percent of sales from the 2.5 percent posted for the first nine months of 1996.
Sunbeam also wants its return on equity to grow to 25 percent from 1 percent in the past year.
Shrinking profit margins and high manufacturing and administrative costs have depressed the company's profits in recent years. Sunbeam earned $50.5 million in 1995, less than half its 1994 profits.
Sunbeam said it will sell or shut 39 of 53 facilities, including 18 of its 26 factories, leaving it just four factories in the United States and four overseas. In addition, warehouses will be cut to 24 from 61.
The company said it will sell several businesses, including those that make furniture, time and temperature devices, scales and decorative bedding.
Sunbeam said its remaining businesses will be centered on kitchen appliances, personal care products, health care items, outdoor cooking equipment and professional care products.
""Our goal is to essentially complete the restructuring initiatives within the next 45 days. Therefore, the company has every intention of meeting its previously stated goal of beginning 1997 as a new company,"" Dunlap said in a statement.
Sales will double by 1999 to $2 billion, he said.
""It will be vintage Dunlap,"" Dunlap said in a conference call with institutional investors and analysts.
Dunlap declined to identify potential deal partners but said new products, including many designed for non-U.S. markets, and other steps would yield 20 percent or better year-over-year revenue growth.
Dunlap, who was named chairman and chief executive officer in July, is credited with turning around Scott Paper Co., which was later sold to Kimberly-Clark. At Scott Paper, Dunlap fired 10,000 workers and sold more than $2 billion in assets.
While his turnaround campaigns have helped stockholders, they have been criticized by community activists, unions and other groups as insensitive to workers.
Within months of joining Sunbeam, Dunlap -- also nicknamed ""Darth Vader"" after the villain of the ""Star Wars"" films -- replaced several top executives and brought in people who had worked for him in the past.
Although restructuring annoucements usually boost a company's stock price, Sunbeam stock lost 75 cents to $25 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
""He's pulled off some amazing turnarounds,"" Chapman Co. analyst Daniel Noll said of Dunlap. ""But I'm a little skeptical. I think the stock's a little ahead of itself.""
""'Chainsaw Al' is a pussycat name for you,"" analyst Andrew Shore of PaineWebber told Dunlap. ""If you pull this off, you should be called 'Nuclear Al.'""

33,"Riding rising U.S. cable TV fees, Time Warner Inc said its earnings before heavy debt payments shot up 32 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same three months last year.
Covering the quarter before last Thursday's completion of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System, the entertainment group said three hit movies, strong magazine advertising sales helped by the Olympic Games, and good HBO results lifted cash flow to $964 million.
Revenues for the three months ended Sept. 30 were $4.877 billion, up from $4.344 billion a year ago.
Last year's third-quarter cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $729 million, the company said on Wednesday.
Time Warner, many of whose cable TV and other businesses are co-owned with 25 percent partner U S West Inc. , reported a net loss of $167 million, or 43 cents a share, for the quarter.
Net losses in last year's quarter were $160 million, or 41 cents a share, on 1.5 million more shares outstanding.
Net interest costs were $276 million, up from $259 million in last year's third quarter. Preferred dividends rose to $76 million in the third quarter from $16 million.
Time Warner's stock showed no gain after the results but rose smartly later in the day after top executives told institutional investors that debt reduction was centre stage at the company.
The executives said Time Warner is in active discussions aimed at restructuring its troubled cable-television partnership with U S West Media Group.
One Time Warner executive said the talks with regional phone group U S West, 25 percent owner of most of Time Warner's cable systems, studios and the HBO pay-TV service, are likely to quicken and could yield a deal within months.
""We want to delever the company, lighten up on cable, and simplify the corporate capital structure,"" said the executive, speaking on a promise of anonymity.
The executives echoed Ted Turner, founder of Turner Broadcasting and now vice chairman of the combined company as well as its biggest individual shareholder. He has said he wants Time Warner's $17.5 billion debt halved.
Time Warner now sees itself with the acquisition of Turner, producer of Cable News Network, The Cartoon Network and two studios, as primarily a programming group, the executives said.
Capital-intensive cable operations are less important and ripe for partial divestment, the executives said. Investment capital can be better used outside cable, the executives said.
EBITDA at Time Warner's cable operations, including those shared with with U S West, rose 14 percent to $512 million, the company said in its earnings report.
Basic cable revenues rose sharply and advertising sales in cable also increased, the company said. With some 12.1 million customers, Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator.
Time Warner also had three summer movies grossing more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales -- ""Twister,"" ""Eraser"" and ""A Time To Kill"".
Time Warner shares rose $1.125 to $42 in New York Stock Exchange Trading.

33,"Florida is set to challenge the tobacco industry on Friday using a tough anti-racketeering law that could mean bigger damages against cigarette makers if the state prevails.
The new claim under the state's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act, tacked onto Florida's existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion for treating smokers' illnesses, could mean more losses for the tobacco makers, tobacco-litigation expert Christopher Mueller of the University of Colorado School of Law said.
""Florida has a good law (for winning damage claims) but it only goes back to 1994. Using RICO may give the state a deeper reach,"" Mueller said.
The state's RICO law, similar to a federal statute and laws on the books in other states, would allow Florida officials to seek damages from before 1994, when a state law was passed that opened the way for Florida to try to recoup money spent on treating poor smokers.
Florida is one of 16 states and several big cities, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, that have sued tobacco companies to recoup costs of health care for poor smokers.
Texas and now Florida are among a handful of states that are also using RICO laws to bolster their claims against Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's biggest cigarette maker, and other tobacco companies. Florida filed the added claims under RICO laws on Nov 4.
Mueller said use of RICO could add to the industry's potential financial losses by allowing Florida to make claims to recoup costs of treating smokers from before 1994.
Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth is set to appear on Friday in county court in West Palm Beach, a spokesman said. He and attorneys for tobacco companies will argue over the industry's request that the RICO claim be dismissed.
It was unclear when a ruling would be made, a court official said.
Presiding Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen recently dismissed 15 counts of the state's 18-count lawsuit that claims the industry was liable for state-paid hospital costs from lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases. The full case is expected to come to trial next year.
A Jacksonville, Fla., jury last summer handed the tobacco industry its biggest loss in a court case yet when it awarded $750,000 to a lung cancer sufferer who had smoked for half a century. The defendant was the Brown &amp; Williamson unit of Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc.
In Washington, anti-smoking groups said divesting tobacco investments was being actively considered by a growing number of institutional investors concerned by both the ethics and the financial outlook for the industry.

33,"Taking mortgage-backed securities as a model, trucking giant Ryder System Inc is bargaining with a half dozen banks on possibly creating securitized financial offerings on as many as 15,000 leased trucks a year.
A first offering of securitized truck leases could come as early as March and all offerings could total as much as $700 million by year-end 1997, Ryder chief financial officer Ed Huston told Reuters.  
""We're thinking of taking a package of leases and selling them,"" Huston said. ""It's a variation of mortgage-backed securities.""
Huston said no deal, which would be an innovation among trucking services groups, had been agreed and warned an unforseeen issue could block the plan.
""We've talked to a number of banks and we are on the verge of selecting one,"" he said.
He declined to identify which banks Ryder was considering. Citicorp is currently a leading finance source for Ryder, Huston said.  
Ryder late Monday announced it would take a $215 million pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter and full-1996 results to pay for a restructuring, early-retirment and layoffs. The moves affect some 2,100 people and should yield savings in 1997 of $75 million for Ryder and $150 million annually afterwards, Huston said.
The charge was bigger than Wall Street expected, Merrill Lynch analyst Jeff Kauffman said.
""It reflects a conviction by management to change things .... Shareholders really want to see some changes and some of them are losing faith in the story. The onus has been put on management to deliver results,"" he said.
""We are encouraged by their conviction. They seem to be in earnest,"" Kauffman said.  
Ryder, which last year agreed to sell its consumer-truck rental operations, now buys about 25,000 each year. Some 15,000 of those would be suitable for lease-backed securitization, Huston said.
Ryder, he said, may be able to free equity by the lease-backed offerings and get lower costs because lease-backed offerings typically get better ratings than company debt instruments.
Ryder now has single A and A- ratings on its debt and might secure a triple A rating on its lease-back offerings, Huston said.
Shares of Ryder were up 3/4 to 29-1/8.

33,"A Florida judge said Friday that he was inclined to let stand civil claims filed under state anti-racketeering laws against the tobacco industry.
Speaking from the bench at the start of a preliminary hearing, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen said he was inclined to let stand claims filed by the state using Florida's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupts Organisations Act, which could mean more losses for cigarette makers.
""It would seem that the state can maintain the RICO actions,"" Cohen said.
The claims under state RICO laws were added last month to the state's existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion compensation for treating smokers' illnesses.
The judge said he would not make up his mind until the end of oral arguments on Friday.
He gave no timetable for making public his decision on a request by Philip Morris Cos. and other cigarette makers that the claims made by the state under RICO laws be thrown out.
Florida State Attorney General Bob Butterworth said before the hearing that a victory against tobacco companies using the RICO law would allow the court to triple the more than $1 billion dollars in damages claimed by the state.
He also said a victory in Florida using its RICO law would widen the war against the tobbaco industry by possibly allowing other states to sue under their own RICO laws.
Lawyer Irving Nathan, representing the tobacco industry, said that lawsuits brought by state governments under anti-racketeering laws were meant to demonise cigarette manufacturers and turn Americans against a legitimate industry.
Nathan argued that the RICO laws did not apply to the tobacco companies that are also being sued in Florida.
The state of Florida in 1995 filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, seeking $1 billion or more for health care costs paid for poor people afflicted with smoking-related ailments.
Last month the state amended the suit using the RICO law and claiming that the tobacco companies had conspired with one another to confuse Americans about the dangers of smoking.
Cohen is not expected to rule for weeks on the tobacco defendents' request that the RICO claims be dismissed but he said in opening remarks that he was inclined to allow the Florida state lawyers to go ahead with the RICO-based claims.
A jury trial of the suit is tentatively scheduled for August 1997, the judge said.
Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, who accompanied Butterworth to the hearing along with Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, said the lawsuits filed by 19 states and several cities were about much more than mere money. The lawsuits were needed to alert people to the dangers of smoking and help curb smoking among teenagers.
""That helps me sell the litigation more than the money,"" Moore said.

33,"Grand Metropolitan Plc's Burger King is benefitting from a sales recovery in Europe, as well as strong U.S. expansion, and should post $10 billion in sales in the fiscal year ending September 30, Burger King chief executive Robert Lowes said on Tuesday.
""There's no question that my goal for this year is $10 billion, to add a billion in sales,"" Lowes told Reuters.  
Burger King's worldwide sales through some 8,700 restaurants, including 756 added during the fiscal year, totalled $9 billion in fiscal 1996, or nine percent more than in the previous 12 months.
Burger King also said in a brief year-end summary that its market share rose, touching 16.2 percent of all fast-food hamburger restaurant sales.  The company competes against sector-leading McDonald's Corp and Wendy's International Inc.  
Comparable store sales, meaning those restaurants open at lease one year, rose 2.3 percent worldwide and 2.6 percent in the United States, Lowes said.
Grand Met, the British branded-goods conglomerate, said last week operating profits at Burger King declined in the last fiscal year because of a European beef scare and a planned turndown in sales of restaurants to franchisees.
European sales last spring were hit by an outbreak of a disease attributed to contaminated British beef, especially hurting the company's hamburger outlets in Britain, France and Germany.  
Lowes said Burger King had responded by substituting for beef some chicken and other foods, including a vegetarian hamburger in Britain, to sustain sales in Europe.
""Our sales volumes are back where they were,"" Lowes said, referring to existing stores.
The executive said new stores to be added, including 75 to be built along British motorways in a deal with Granada Group Plc, would lift sales.
Burger King was also negotiating other deals in Europe similar to the one with Granada, Lowes said.  He gave no details.

The publishing unit's EBITDA was $99 million, or 15 percent more than the $86 million posted in the year-ago quarter. Sports Illustrated, which produced a daily, limited-circulation version of its weekly magazine during the Atlanta Olympics, had particularly strong advertising sales.
The recorded music unit's EBITDA rose $1 million to $143 million from last year's quarter, when the division took an $85 million charge. Small gains in foreign sales were offset by drops in U.S. music sales, the company said.

6,"""The Times They Are a-Changin"" -- Bob Dylan's counter-culture anthem of the 1960's  -- is being used in a commericial for a Canadian bank and some fans are up in arms.
The Bank of Montreal is running a television commercial using the American singer's 1964 folk classic to lure baby boomers into the country's third biggest bank. The TV spot shows children running down country roads and across lush fields as a choir sings Dylan's song.
The commercial ends with a Bank of Montreal logo and the promise of a big announcement on Oct. 16.
The new campaign has drawn fire from Dylan fans angry that a big institution has co-opted this protest song from their youth. But a senior bank official said Dylan's lyrics reflect the bank's desire to change in the 1990s.
""Our view is a bank has to change because the times are changing. We thought the lyrics caught rather nicely the imperative for large institutions, like banks, that they face having to change,"" George Bothwell, senior vice-president of public affairs, said in a telephone interview.
Some callers to a morning radio show in Toronto were outraged at the ad campaign. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. played the commercial and Dylan's version, then asked listeners for their reaction.
""I was appalled. The bank failed to understand the spirit of the song. It has so many associations for people our age. I hope they reconsider. They went over the line with this one,"" one female caller said.
Another listener said: ""Bob Dylan, I can only say, shame on you.""
Dylan still owns the copyright to the song but was unavailable for comment.
Some younger callers said aging baby boomers have only themselves to blame.
""I don't know why you're surprised. You had high ideals when you grew up. Then you started making money and buying cars. And all the ideals are no longer convenient so you sold out. Every single one of you. Dylan is just doing what everyone is doing,"" a young listener said.
Another caller scoffed at the controversy: ""Baby boomers spare us the crocodile tears. A lot of people have sold out.""
One listener found it ironic that in these tough economic times a bank would use a song that warned: ""You better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone.""
Canada's big banks, which are on track for a third straight year of record profits, have been criticized for high service fees and tight lending policies.

6,"Stock in Canada's big banks tumbled on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday after a Canadian brokerage cut its recommendations on the high-flying bank group.
CIBC Wood Gundy, a unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, cut its ratings on four of the so-called Big Six banks. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, the smallest of the six major banks, received the only buy recommendation.
""We are lowering our recommendations on the group of Canadian bank stocks, moving from three buys to only one buy,"" said CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell.
Canadian bank stocks have soared to all-time highs in recent months, with Toronto's bank index up 46 percent in 1996.
But the group's valuation multiples are now averaging 1.7 times book value -- closing the gap between Canadian bank stocks and their U.S. counterparts, Maxwell said in a report to institutional investors.
Toronto's financial services group plummeted 145 points, or 2.7 percent, in heavy trading on Tuesday.
Bank of Montreal, which Maxwell reduced to hold from accumulate, fell C$1.55 ($1.16) to C$42.15 ($31.63) on 1.5 million shares.
Bank of Nova Scotia dropped C$1.85 ($1.38) to C$44.50 ($33.39) on 995,000 shares after Maxwell recommended investors reduce their Scotiabank holdings.
Royal Bank of Canada, which was cut to accumulate from buy, surrendered C$1.30 ($0.75) to C$46 ($34.52) on 2.9 million shares. Canada's biggest bank is the group's valuation leader with a multiple of 2.0 times book value, Maxwell said.
CIBC dropped C$1.70 ($1.27) to C$57.25 ($43) on 700,000 shares. Maxwell did not assign a ranking to CIBC.
Toronto-Dominion Bank sank C$1.15 (86 cents) to C$33.40 ($25) on volume of 1.3 million shares after it was lowered to accumulate from buy.
""Of the five largest banks, our top pick would remain TD (Toronto-Dominion), since it is most likely to continue to exercise its share repurchase programme, even at current multiples, reflecting its superior capital strength,"" Maxwell said.
National Bank of Canada fell 55 cents Canadian (41 cents) to C$13.35 ($10) on 1.05 million shares despite having the only buy recommendation of the group.
But some stock strategists remained bullish on Canadian banks. They said the group was still popular among foreign investors seeking to jump into the Canadian market, lured by interest rates at 40-year lows and a recovering economy.
""Foreigners are attracted to Canadian investments and one of the best areas they can participate in is the banking sector,"" said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities.

6,"A furry hedgehog, idyllic sunsets and the meaner streets of Budapest seem unlikely moneyspinners, but such images are crowding Canada's airwaves as the annual mutual fund season kicks into gear.
Armed with high-powered ad campaigns, eager fund sellers are vying for the billions of dollars Canadians will pour into registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs).
With interest rates at 40-year lows and stocks at stratospheric heights, investors are expected to shun interest-bearing investments for higher yielding mutual funds before the March 1 deadline for RRSP contributions.
""We're in the thick of it right now and it's going to get busier and busier toward the end of the (RRSP) season,"" said John Wiltshire, vice-president of marketing for Investors Group, Canada's top fund company with C$25 billion ($18 billion) in assets.
TAX BENEFIT IS A DRAW
Canada introduced RRSPs in the late 1950s to allow people without registered pension plans to save for retirement. Investors can deduct the amount from their taxes for the previous year's income.
Besides being a tax benefit, RRSPs have become more popular as traditional pension benefits are scaled back.
Canadians have more than C$211 billion ($156 billion) stashed in mutual funds, an eight-fold increase from 1990. An estimated C$23 billion ($17 billion) will be added to the pot this year.
Fund companies also expect a big chunk of the C$250 billion ($186 billion) currently invested in guaranteed investment certificates and term deposits to shift into funds.
In what has become an annual rite of the Canadian winter, fund sellers flood the airwaves with promotions, hype and gimmicks to lure RRSP dollars. But, unlike the United States, Canadian broadcast rules prohibit companies from making performance claims on television or radio.
""That's why you get fuzzy advertising. They talk about lifestyle and emphasise branding,"" said John Kaszel, director of research for Investment Funds Institute of Canada, a lobby group representing 40 fund companies.
Soft-sell ads feature happy people in tranquil settings with simple messages such as ""We're here to get you there,"" or ""quietly creating wealth.""
NEXT GENERATION THE TARGET
Some firms are targeting the next generation of investors. GT Global, a member of Liechtenstein Global Trust, launched a Kid's Kit in December to teach youngsters about mutual funds.
When a parent opens a minimum C$500 ($370) account, his child gets a stuffed ""Henry the Hedgehog"" toy, a certificate and a colourful book explaining ""Henry's Mysterious Gift.""
""This is a chance to give a gift to your kids that is tangible and gets them into the habit of investing,"" said CT Global President Joe Canavan.
Other ads feature smartly tailored people using words such as ""discipline"" and ""performance"" to trumpet their firm's investment strategy.
Spectrum United Mutual Funds' gritty commercials highlight its team of tough global fund managers, including one who scored a big success investing in a Budapest security company.
To add levity to the RRSP season, Bank of Montreal's campaign pricked the balloons of so-called ""experts"", but there was little information on the bank's own funds.
Critics complain that Canada's advertising rules insult investors' intelligence.
""Mutual fund regulators are convinced that mutual fund investors are ignorant dolts who need to be protected from themselves and the industry. The result, as far as radio and television are concerned, is a multimillion dollar river of non-information,"" Toronto Globe and Mail columnist Terence Corcoran wrote recently.
SCANDALS MAY MEAN TIGHTER CONTROLS
But regulators are unlikely to relax their grip on the industry. In fact, the rules could tighten after recent scandals such as the Veronika Hirsch affair.
Hirsch was a star stock picker hired last summer to spearhead Boston-based Fidelity Investments' drive to dominate the Canadian market. But she was removed from her portfolio in November amid a controversy over personal trades she made before joining the world's biggest mutual fund company.
Fidelity also offered clients their money back without penalty. ""We were pleased that the number of people who did take advantage of it was less than our expectation,"" said spokesman Chethan Lakshman, but he did not give any numbers.
Hirsch's True North Equity Fund is now under a less flamboyant manager and has accumulated C$211 million ($156 million) in assets since its launch last September.
Hirsch's status was under discussion, Lakshman said, but a separation package was rumoured to be under negotiation.
FALLOUT PROMPTS GUIDELINES REVIEW
The fallout from the Hirsch affair prompted a review of the industry's guidlines for fund managers. ""It has opened up some concerns, but those are being addressed. Now we are seeing whether more should be done,"" Kaszel said.
While analysts said it was difficult to assess the damage to the industry's credibility, the Hirsch affair changed how companies sell their product.
Brash campaigns built around high-profile stock pickers are out and the ""team"" is in, analysts said.
Canada's Big Six banks are also heavy advertisers this year as they strive to become bigger players in a industry dominated by independents.
Three banks are now among the top 10 firms, with Royal Bank of Canada number three behind Investors Group amd Trimark Investment Management Inc.
The banks were allowed to enter the mutual fund business in 1987 and now account for 29 percent of the industry's assets. Fund management fees have helped propel bank profits to record highs in recent years.

6,"U.S. mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments said on Saturday that Canadian regulators were investigating trades made by Veronika Hirsch, the star manager of their new Canadian equity fund.
Hirsch's 27-city road show to promote Fidelity's True North fund has been postponed as a result of the regulatory review, said a spokesman for the Boston-based mutual fund company.
The tour was scheduled to begin on Monday.
""Veronika Hirsch ... was recently contacted by a regulatory agency about her personal investments before she joined Fidelity,"" Chethan Lakshman, a spokesman for Fidelity's Canadian subsidiary, Fidelity Investments Canada Ltd., said in a telephone interview.
""At this time it is appropriate to postpone the tour and we're hopeful that the regulatory review of her trading activity will result in a favorable conclusion,"" Lakshman said.
He did not identify the regulator, but Canadian newspapers reported on Saturday that the British Columbia Securities Commission was looking into the matter.
Lakshman said Hirsch was not available for interviews and he was unsure of her whereabouts.
The controversy is over Hirsch's investments in a Vancouver-based exploration firm, Oliver Gold Corp., earlier this year while she was a high-profile fund manager with AGF Management Ltd. in Toronto.
Hirsch, a flamboyant stock picker compared to her sedate peers in Canada's mutual fund industry, was hired by Fidelity with much fanfare in August after only 10 months at AGF.
Fidelity is conducting its own review of Hirsch's actions before she joined the company.
During her brief stint at AGF, Hirsch bought 65,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold for herself through a private placement in April, according to statements filed with the British Columbia Securities Commission and reported by Vancouver-based Canada Stockwatch, a newsletter which tracks Canadian stocks.
Hirsch paid C$1.53 ($1.14) per warrant.
A short time later, the AGF Growth &amp; Income Fund managed by Hirsch bought 295,000 special warrants, according to the filings with the B.C. commission.
The AGF fund paid over double the price, C$3.60 ($2.69) per warrant, paid by Hirsch.
Another related issue is whether Hirsch used a false address in British Columbia to buy the Oliver Gold shares. Canadian newspapers have reported that the home address of a Vancouver stock analyst and institutional salesman was used.
Hirsch is a resident of Ontario and the Oliver Gold stock was only available to British Columbia residents.
AGF chief executive officer Warren Goldring has said Hirsch broke company rules by failing to report her personal investment in Oliver Gold. He added Hirsch could have been fired if AGF had known about the trades.
The controversy swirling around Hirsch has dominated the business pages of Canadian newspapers, but Lakshman said the publicity has not hurt Fidelity's efforts to build a higher profile in Canadian equities management.
""We have had a lot of great responses to the (True North) fund. It has been well-received and has grown to more than C$150 million ($112 million),"" Lakshman said.
"
6,"Bank of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, said Tuesday annual profits soared past C$1 billion ($750 million) as it kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings reporting season for the country's largest banks.
The Toronto-based bank, which has operations in Canada, the United States and Mexico, said net income jumped 18.4 percent to C$1.17 billion ($873 million) in the year ended Oct. 31. The bank's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 17 percent from 15.4 percent last year.
""These results represent the seventh consecutive year of record earnings and the seventh consecutive year return on equity was over 14 percent,"" Chairman Matthew Barrett said in a statement.
Bank of Montreal is the third bank to break through the C$1 billion threshold in recent years, following the Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The bank attributed the record earnings to higher fees, volume growth in Canada and the United States and the impact of acquiring a 16 percent stake in Mexico's Grupo Financiero Bancomer SA de CV.
About 47 percent of the Bank of Montreal's total income came from operations outside of Canada in fiscal 1996.
Net income from its U.S. operations, where the bank owns Chicago-based Harris Bankcorp Inc., rose 6 percent to C$390 million ($291 million).
Earnings from Mexico rose 4 percent to C$57 million ($42 million). Other international businesses contributed C$102 million ($76 million) to the bank's bottom line, up 1 percent from 1995.
Speaking to reporters, Barrett said the bank should meet or exceed 10 percent growth in annual earnings per share going forward.
""There is sufficient counter cyclicality built into the range of businesses and range of geographies that we're operating in now that we continue to feel that we would be able to maintain that 10 percent EPS growth or better in the years ahead,"" Barrett said.
The bank's earnings were generally in line with estimates.
Fourth quarter earnings rose to C$1.04 (77 cents) a share from 93 cents (69 cents) in the same period in 1995.
""They were a little weaker than what I was looking for, but pretty much in line for intents and purposes,"" said Kevin Choquette, an analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.
Choquette had forecast fourth quarter earnings of C$1.06 (79 cents) a share.
Improved credit quality also contributed to the bank's strong performance. It's provision for credit losses fell to C$225 million ($168 million) in 1996 from C$275 million ($205 million) in 1995.
Barrett told reporters that the bank will plan for a credit loss provision of C$275 million in 1997.
""We'll stick with that until we are six months into the year and see how the credit cycle shakes out,"" he said.
Bank of Montreal's stock closed down C$0.45 (33 cents) to C$44.20 (33 cents) in heavy turnover of 1.5 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The recent rally in Canadian bank stocks pushed Bank of Montreal's return on investment up 42.4 percent in 1996, compared to a 24-percent gain last year.
Despite today's weakness in Bank of Montreal shares, the TSE's banks and trusts index climbed 14 points to a new high of 6164.60.

6,"Anti-government protests swept across Canada's biggest city on Friday as demonstrators in Toronto shut down the transit system, disrupted businesses and tried to break into the Toronto Stock Exchange.
""We've come to the place where the real power is ... They get their power and strength from inside this building,"" Jim Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Auto Workers, told hundreds of protesters outside the exchange.
Demonstrators chanted ""Shut it down, shut it down,"" as they pounded on the glass doors of Canada's biggest stock market. One man wearing a mask and combat fatigues was seen hurling himself against the doors.
Protest organisers later moved the rally away from the doors of the exchange.
In another part of the city, Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves said it was ironic that some of the groups that are protesting have huge pension funds that invest in stocks.
Protesters hit Toronto streets, paralysing rush-hour subway trains and closing businesses in Canada's biggest city to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.
Subway and bus service ground to a halt in this city of 2.2 million people, forcing about one million commuters to walk, drive or cycle to work or just stay home.
Unionized workers, civil servants and social activists also descended on government offices and factories in the first day of the so-called ""Days of Protest"" against budget cutbacks.
But picketers failed to disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest. Expected traffic jams on the city expressways also did not materialise.
In the days leading up to the protest, a siege mentality gripped Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community.
At least one brokerage firm flew traders to its offices in New York and Montreal, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight.
Other companies hired boats to ferry employees across Lake Ontario from nearby communities.
The protesters are furious with Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.
Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.
""These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarisation that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,"" Syd Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building.
But Harris, who has been dubbed ""Newt of the North"" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his ""Common Sense Revolution.""
""Will they discourage us from creating more jobs? No. Discourage us from workfare? No. That's what we were elected to do and I don't expect that most of the public want us to change from that agenda,"" Harris told reporters.
The Conservatives' popularity has held at around 50 percent in recent opinion polls.
Many commuters took the delays in stride.
""I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,"" said John Ivarey.
A poll taken this week found that 67 percent of Toronto residents opposed the ""Days of Action"" rallies.
Protesters waved placards and temporarily blocked cars from entering government parking lots, but Toronto police said there were no major incidents of violence.
One man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening picketers with a baseball bat outside a bus garage. There also were skirmishes outside a postal station.
Several major manufacturers cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc. , said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant would be off the job Friday.

6,"Stock in Canadian waste and transportation firm Laidlaw Inc. soared on Tuesday as investors and analysts applauded major moves in ambulance services and waste management worth over $2 billion.
While Laidlaw's stock hit new heights on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Chief Executive Officer James Bullock said the company was poised for strong growth with two huge deals announced after the market closed on Monday.
In a bid to become North America's top ambulance operator, Laidlaw plans to acquire Colorado-based American Medical Response Inc. in a $1.12 billion cash deal and merge it with its California-based MedTrans ambulance services unit.
In the other transaction, Laidlaw has signed a letter of intent to sell its South Carolina-based Environmental Services unit for $1 billion in cash, shares and debt to Rollins Environmental Services Inc. of Delaware.
After that deal, Laidlaw will own 66 percent of a new combined company, Laidlaw Environmental Services Inc., which will be the dominant player in North American hazardous waste management.
The moves came a few weeks after Burlington, Ontario-based Laidlaw completed the $1.65 billion sale of its solid waste management business to Allied Waste Industries Inc. of Arizona.
Laidlaw's class B stock closed up C$1.80 ($1.33) at a 52-week high of C$18 ($13) in heavy turnover of 9.3 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Laidlaw's class A stock rose C$1.45 ($1.06) to a new high of C$17.95 ($13.23).
""We've got a (share price) target level of around C$19 ($14) and C$20 ($15) for the year and it will probably go higher when the dust settles,"" said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities.
American Medical Response jumped $6.375 to close at $39.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Rollins Environmental rose 37.5 cents to $2.375, also on the NYSE.
Analysts said the Rollins deal will further consolidate a fragmented industry and may improve prices for hazardous waste companies, which have been depressed in the past four to five years.
The American Medical Response acquisition will also boost Laidlaw's presence in the fast-growing health-care transportation area.
""Strategically, it is quite wise,"" Bunting Warburg Inc. analyst Ted Larkin said in a telephone interview.
""The highest growth potential is with their transportation companies. They are also able to partially spin off the hazardous waste operations and also allow that company to regain a profile by listing on the New York Stock Exchange,"" Larkin said.
With combined annual revenues of about $1.3 billion, the new American Medical will hold a 14 percent share of the $10 billion ambulance industry. It also gives Laidlaw access to related medical transport services, a $30 billion market.
Laidlaw CEO Bullock said American Medical will immediately boost Laidlaw's earnings, but he declined to give a specific forecast.
Some analysts raised concerns that antitrust issues may hamper the American Medical deal, but Bullock said he did not foresee any problems with regulators.
The transaction with Rollins Environmental will be neutral to Laidlaw's earnings in the near term while operations are consolidated.
Bullock said staff levels may be reduced by 15 percent to20 percent and 20 facilities may be closed, leaving about 100 facilities in the merged firm. The transition is expected to result in more efficient operations and savings of $75 million annually.
"
6,"Canada's Big Six banks are poised for a third straight year of record profits when they begin reporting year-end earnings on Tuesday, but analysts expect earnings growth to slow in 1997.
The group's combined profit is expected to top C$6 billion ($4.5 billion) for the year ended Oct. 31, eclipsing a record C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) in 1995, analysts said.
Most of the increase was due to higher investment banking and fee revenues and lower loan losses.
""It's going to be a very good quarter again, but we may be getting toward the end of very strong quarter-over-quarter growth,"" said Roy Palmer, an analyst with TD Securities Inc.
High-flying bank stocks may get a further boost if the group beats analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit gains of between 15 percent and 17 percent.
""If we get good news and they come in at or higher than analysts' estimates, I think you will see some significant strength,"" said Fred Ketchen, director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's financial services group jumped 176 points to close at a 52-week high of 5541.40 on Monday as analysts predicted several banks would reward shareholders with dividend hikes.
Bank shares have soared this autumn as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by declining interest rates, low inflation and a recovering economy.
The sector has added about 1,400 points since early September and powered the TSE to record heights.
Listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile south of the border. Some U.S. brokers have issued buy ratings on Canadian bank stocks, which are considered cheap compared to U.S. issues.
But earlier this month, Canadian brokerage CIBC Wood Gundy lowered its recommendations on most of the group.
CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell said the group's valuation multiples were averaging 1.7 times book value -- narrowing the gap between Canadian bank shares and their U.S. counterparts.
Maxwell said in a report that bank officials warned analysts that their estimates for average earnings growth of 14 percent in 1997 were too optimistic and that 8 percent was The earnings parade will kick off with Bank of Montreal on Tuesday and wrap up with National Bank of Canada on Dec. 5.
Bank of Montreal is expected to post a fourth-quarter profit of C$1.06 (79 cents) a share, up from C$0.93 (69 cents) a share a year ago, according to figures provided by the International Brokerage Estimates Service.
Bank of Nova Scotia's earnings on Wednesday are seen climbing to C$1.01 (75 cents) a share from 88 cents Canadian (65 cents) a share.
Toronto-Dominion Bank's earnings are forecast to rise to 74 cents Canadian (55 cents) a share on Thursday, up from 72 cents Canadian (54 cents) a share last year.
Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce -- the country's two biggest banks -- report next week.
Royal Bank's fourth-quarter results are forecast to be C$1.02 (76 cents) a share, compared to last year's 90 cents Canadian (67 cents) per share.
CIBC is seen improving to C$1.51 ($1.12) a share in the fourth quarter from C$1.26 (94 cents) per share a year earlier.
National Bank of Canada, the smallest of the big six banks, is expected to post a 42 cents Canadian (31 cents) per share profit, up from 33 cents Canadian (25 cents) a year earlier.

6,"Profits at Canada's six big banks topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) in 1996, smashing last year's C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) record as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada wrapped up the earnings season on Thursday.
The six banks each reported a double-digit jump in net income for a combined profit of C$6.26 billion ($4.6 billion) in fiscal 1996 ended Oct. 31.
But a third straight year of record profits came amid growing public anger over perceived high service charges and credit card rates, and tight lending policies.
Bank officials defended the group's performance, saying that millions of Canadians owned bank shares through mutual funds and pension plans.
Shareholders of four of the six banks were rewarded with healthy dividend hikes this year.
""Our activities mean jobs, investment, tax revenue, dividend payments and foreign income for Canada's economy,"" CIBC chairman Al Flood said after the bank reported a 35 percent jump in net income on Thursday.
CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, said net income climbed to C$1.36 billion ($1 billion) in fiscal 1996 from C$1.01 billion ($743 million) in 1995.
CIBC also boosted its quarterly dividend by C5 cents (3.6 cents) to C50 cents (37 cents), the second increase in 1996.
Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada previously raised their payouts as well.
Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, reported the highest corporate profit in Canadian history on Wednesday, with 1996 net income rising 13 percent to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion).
Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal cracked the billion-dollar barrier this year, joining CIBC and Royal Bank, which crossed the threshold in 1995 and 1994 respectively.
National Bank, the smallest of the big six, posted a 30 percent jump in net income to C$318 million ($234 million) this year.
The banks attributed their performances to lower credit losses and healthy commercial and personal banking. Investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses also enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.
Earnings at CIBC's Wood Gundy Inc. investment arm skyrocketed 122 percent to C$528 million ($389 million) in 1996.
The group's earnings and dividend hikes were in line or slightly better than analysts' forecasts.
""It was good news and a fairly good outlook for 1997 in terms of earnings and dividends,"" said Hugh Brown, a banking analyst with investment dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc.
Brown said he now had a more positive outlook for bank earnings in 1997, saying Big Six profits may grow between 9 and 10 percent next year, up from previous growth forecasts of about 7 percent.
Bank stocks, which have led the Toronto Stock Exchange to new heights since September, fell on Thursday in tandem with the rest of the market. CIBC led the decline, dropping C$2.25 ($1.65) to C$57.25 ($42) in late trading.

9,"Intel Corp shares slid another four points on Friday, continuing a three-day retreat triggered by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc's statement that its turnaround plan is on track.
But analysts and money managers were unruffled by what they said was profit-taking in Intel and a temporary shift among some momentum investors to AMD and away from Intel.
Intel stock has lost about six percent of its value since Wednesday, when Advanced Micro said it was sampling its Pentium-like K6 chip, which its expect to ship in early 1997.  
Intel closed at 115-7/8, down 4, on volume of 15 million shares, marking it as the most active Nasdaq stock. Intel, a key component in the Nasdaq Composite index, has acted as a drag on the market even as the NYSE has hit new record highs.
The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 1261.81, off 8.55.
Edwin Turney, a Silicon Valley-based technology money manager who runs the Panagea fund, agreed, saying: ""You have a lot of profit-taking and then you have got the momentum players who have had a hell of a run in the last 6 months.
""So now they are looking at the secondary players,"" Turney said, referring specifically to Advanced Micro.  
""AMD has been a catalyst for other people to take profit,"" agreed Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst Thomas Kurlak.
""There is really nothing specifically to explain (Intel's recent decline). It's just another wiggle in the chart.""
Soundview President James Townsend agreed AMD's announcement may have provided an excuse for some investors to temporarily shift out of Intel.
""With a stock that has been this incredibly successful, it may be enough to take some profits off the table,"" Townsend said. He was referring to Intel's impressive 50 point rise to new record levels since mid-summer.  
AMD stock has languished in recent years after repeated failures to match Intel's Pentium technology. However, since Wednesday, the stock has gained more than 20 percent. It closed at 25-1/8, up 1/2 point on the day on Friday.
Analysts said AMD's new K6 chips are not compatible with Intel latest Pentium Pro chips, but the chip could do a healthy business as a simple Pentium alternative.
""There's clearly room enough for both companies to do well,"" said C.B. Lee, an analyst at Hancock Institutional Partners, who follows both Intel and AMD.  
""Clearly, AMD has had some impact in the minds of some investors,"" Lee said of Intel's declines in recent days, but added: ""In my mind AMD is not a threat.""
Analysts expect Intel to produce 20 million Pentium microprocessors in the current quarter, while AMD will build only a tiny fraction of that number -- and less powerful processers at that.
Like most chip sector securities analysts, Kurlak maintains a strong buy on Intel and a neutral rating on AMD.
Lee said he also remains neutral on AMD, ""but its back in my good graces"" with its plans to introduce the K6 chip.
In the last week, Prudential Securities analyst Mark Edelstone was alone among Wall Street analysts in upgrading AMD to a buy from a hold in response to the K6 announcement.

9,"Small capitalization technology stocks shrugged off a wave of profit-taking that socked blue chip stocks Monday as investors shopped for values among beaten- down or lesser known names, especially in the Internet sector.
""Some of the second- and third-tier technology names have become the focus,"" agreed Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.  
Among the beneficiaries of this broadening interest in technology stocks were America Online Inc, up 4-1/8 to 39-1/2 and Adobe Systems Inc, up 2-1/4 to 41-3/4.
Informix Corp was the most actively traded issue on the Nasdaq, gaining 1-1/4 to 25 by mid-afternoon Monday, following reports that its next-generation Universal Server database has the edge over rival Oracle Corp.
Other strong gainers included Netscape Communications Corp, which rose 2-1/8 to 58 and electronic payment company CyberCash Inc, which gained 2-7/8 to 28-1/8.  
""We are stepping down the liquidity and quality ladder,"" said Paul Rabbit, Oppenheimer's chief portfolio strategist. ""(Investors) are trying to find some of the beat up ones,"" he said, adding, ""There is a search for less exploited areas.""
""Today is the first (trading) day of a new month and there appears to be a little profit taking here, but it doesn't appear to be affecting the technology stocks,"" Bleier said.
Analysts said investors were shying from bellwethers Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp following their strong run-up in November, even as International Business Machines Corp hit a new year-high.  
Intel was down 1-1/8 to 125-3/4 on volume of nearly five million shares, while Microsoft shed 1-1/4 to 155-5/8. Both stocks remain near historic price levels. The Dow Jones composite index was off 41.74 to 6479.96.

9,"Microcom Inc and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems said Wednesday they plan to beef up their technology partnership to speed development of higher speed 56-kilobit modems for central switch equipment.
The 56 kilobit modems would allow computer users to connect to the Internet at speeds nearly double the rate of current 28.8 kilobit modems now available using standard phone lines.
The deal builds on a decade-old product development partnership between Microcom and Rockwell. Rockwell Semiconductor is a unit of Rockwell International Corp.  
New Microcom central site switch equipment would give the receiving end -- phone carriers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and corporate central offices -- the capacity to handle incoming calls from computers with 56 kilobit modems.
""It increases the market scope of Rockwell's 56k offering,"" said Prudential analyst Jim Thayer of Rockwell's 56 kilobit modem plans. He maintains a buy rating on Microcom.
However, Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Rakesh Sood said the Microcom/Rockwell pact was a defensive response to a U.S. Robotics Inc initiative already well under way by the company to offer its own set of 56 kilobit modem products.  
In the Rockwell/Microcom pact, Rockwell will contribute its K56Plus modem chipset to the venture, while Microcom will offer its Modemware technology, a software interface that other equipment providers license to build their own modems.
To speed 56k development, Rockwell said it is opening an East Coast development center with 15 to 20 Rockwell engineers working alongside Microcom staff. The center will initially be at Microcom's headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. Rockwell is based in Seal Beach, Calif.  
As part of the partnership, Rockwell and Microcom are working together to drive standards development of a new high speed modem standard that would incorporate Microcom's MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) standard.
Modems based on the Rockwell chip design would not be compatible with those from Robotics until an industry-wide standard for compatability can be hammered out, which no industry player seriously expects before 1998.  
In the intervening period, modems based on Rockwell's standard will work only with central office switches from partners such as Microcom, while Robotics modems will work only with equipment offered by backers of its standard.
U.S. Robotics has licensed its X2 56 kilobit technology to chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc and to modem supplier Cardinal Technologies Inc CRTK.O.
Robotics plans to introduce 56 kilobit modems in January and remote access equipment in February, a spokeswoman said.
Rockwell's own 56 kilobit plans have been slower getting off the ground, but the company has said it too plans to introduce new 56k modems in the first quarter of 1997.  
Nonetheless, Rockwell's technology has been embraced by Ascend Communications Inc and consumer modem makers Boca Research Inc, Hayes Microcomputer Inc and Zoom Telephonics Inc, who are unhappy doing business with rival U.S. Robotics Inc, the dominant consumer modem supplier.
Microcom said it plans to incorporate the Rockwell K56Plus technology into central site modem systems that it sells both directly and indirectly, through partnerships with Cisco Systems Inc, Bay Networks Inc, Digital Equipment Corp and Gandalf Technologies INc.  
Microcom officials said they expect Rockwell/Microcom modems to be adopted by many network equipment makers who fear relying on Robotics, which is seen as a competitive threat.
Microcom said products based the Rockwell design will be available for test and evaluation early in 1997 and that finished products will ship in central site and remote modem equipment by late in the first quarter of 1997.
Thayer argued the schism over standards should buy time for the Rockwell camp and may allow it to gain market share from Robotics due to Rockwell's wider base of support.
""They should have a fairly high share of 56 kilobit market over time,"" Thayer said of the Rockwell/Microcom partnership.
However, Sood argues the market for 56 kilobit modems will come largely from home computer users not office workers, who have access to other high-speed communications alternatives.
This plays to U.S. Robotics' strength as an equipment supplier to a majority of the top 10 Internet access providers aimed at consumers, like America Online Inc and Netcom On-line Communications Inc, Sood said.

9,"H&amp;R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, said Wednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe online unit, at least for now.
The Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part of the online service earlier this year, cited CompuServe's recent financial troubles and uncertainties facing the online industry.
Industry analysts said the problems reflect the changes rippling through the online industry but were also partly unique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 million subscribers, slightly more than half of them outside of the United States.
America Online Inc., the largest with more than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Prodigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to the Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online services.
Some analysts have said that the online services, which offer packages of specialised information as well as Internet access, may not survive in the long run, though the eventual shape of the online industry remains far from certain.
""A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky,"" said one analyst who follows the industry.
H&amp;R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in April and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders.
But it said Wednesday that it has decided not to present the proposed spin-off of the rest of CompuServe to shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.
""The board continues to believe that a separation of CompuServe is in the best interests of H&amp;R Block shareholders and will continue to consider the matter,"" H&amp;R Block interim President Frank Salizzoni said.
CompuServe's stock has dropped from a high of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 recently. The stock rose after Wednesday's announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&amp;R Block will not come onto the market.
CompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&amp;R Block fell $2.125 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq.
In July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company.
The company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers.
In response, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging they had misrepresented the online service's prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.
When the company last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for the second quarter ending in October.
H&amp;R Block, which is also the nation's largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts said.
In addition to the losses, H&amp;R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service.
Meanwhile, America Online has had problems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a slower pace.
""The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months,"" one analyst said.
"
9,"Acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, CompuServe Corp said it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and plans to defend its business and technical customer base.
The world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs.
Instead, it said it would pursue higher margin businesses, including international consumer markets, such as Europe.  
""For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.
""CompuServe will never contend for the King's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again,"" he declared.
CompuServe stock fell 1-5/8, to 10-1/8, in early trading. H&amp;R Block Inc, which several months ago suspended plans to spin off its remaining 80 percent stake in CompuServe to shareholders, fell 1-1/2, to 26-7/8.  
Earlier today, H&amp;R had reported a substantial loss for its quarter ended October 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil, and said it planned to go ahead with a cut in its quarterly dividend payment to $0.20 per share from $0.32 previously.
In its own report, CompuServe said it lost $0.63 per share for the second quarter ended in October, after charges for exiting the Wow! business and other accounting changes. This compared to a $0.19 a share profit in the year-ago quarter.
Disbanding Wow! resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.9 million, or $0.06 a share, and amortization of prior marketing costs led to the charge of $28.6 million, or $0.31 a share.  
""CompuServe's core users have always appreciated that service most for its independent forums and bulletin boards. They don't have any other place in cyberspace to get those services,"" Krasilovsky said.
CompuServe officials stressed that no new layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total headcount stands at about 3,200 worldwide.
In a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway maintained that while his company was abandoning further mass marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, ""If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.""  
Nontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would focus its efforts and investments going forward on business and professional markets, its traditional selling point.
Besides defending its core online services customer base, they said CompuServe will focus on other profitable operations like its network systems infrastructure unit, which generates 30 percent of total revenues.
In disbanding its Wow! service, the company blamed new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.
The company announced plans to launch early next year a new ""CompuServe for Business"" serivce, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new software interface and added content from ""thousands"" of information providers.  
Despite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas, where CompuServe's brand is the best recognized name among online and Internet access providers.
Conway said CompuServe Interactive's service has nearly doubled in its number of subscribers in Europe during the past 12 months, rising to more than 800,000 from about 450,000. ""It's a growing market for these services, and we outpaced the market,"" he said.
About 60 percent of CompuServe's European customers are for business, professional and technical users, while 40 percent fall in the consumer category, Conway said.
That's roughly the inverse of North America, where about 55 percent of CompuServe's main service are consumers.
The 800,000 customers represent the bulk of CompuServe's international base, which totaled 1.12 million at October 31.
The Wow! service had been introduced only seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground.
CompuServe Vice President Scott Kaufman, the man in charge of developing the Wow! service, promised at the time Wow! was lauched to carpet bomb consumers with free software disks promoting the new service.
""They'll be falling out of cereal boxes,"" he had vowed at the time.

9,"Intel Corp. stock surged Tuesday, lifted by a quarterly earnings report that substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations and confirmed its status among analysts as the shooting star of technology stocks.
The earnings report released Monday spurred gains in the stocks of personal computer makers who build machines based on Intel microprocessors but it did little to buoy other chip makers.
""The Intel report was clearly a positive for the whole PC industry,"" said veteran semiconductor analyst Dan Klesken of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
""It is an endorsement of our view that we are in for a strong upgrade cycle for the second half of the year,"" said Klesken.
Still, analysts said Intel stock gains were restrained by uncertainties over whether the third quarter's sharp rise in orders may have come at the expense of the fourth quarter.
The concern was magnified by Intel's decision to at least temporarily halt the practice of forecasting its business prospects.
Intel stock rose $3.50 to $111.125 Tuesday on Nasdaq in a volatile day of trading in which just under 20 million Intel shares changed hands. Intel's gains sparked the technology-heavy Nasdaq index to 1,258.10, up 1.74, its second consecutive record closing high.
On Monday Intel reported third-quarter profits of $1.3 billion, up from $931 million in 1995's third quarter. Wall Street had predicted profits of $1.1 billion.
Brokers responded to the results with a wave of higher earnings projections for Intel for 1996 and 1997.
Personal computer makers who rely on Intel micrprocessors also saw significant gains, as investors viewed Intel's order surge as confirmation of strong demand for the machines themselves.
Compaq Computer Corp. gained $2 to close at $74.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a day ahead of its own earnings report, due Wednesday.
Dell Computer Corp. rose $3.50 to $88.375 and Gateway 2000 Inc. climbed $3.375 to $56.75, both on Nasdaq.
But Intel's swelling fortunes were seen as having only limited effect on other semiconductor suppliers.
Montgomery Securities analyst Clark Westmont said the main beneficiaries were a handful of custom PC chip makers who sell graphics controllers and other PC-related devices.
Every Intel processor that goes into a PC is accompanied by serveral such ancillary chips.
""Intel is the locomotive who drags along all the other guys in this food chain,"" Westmont said. ""As a result, these other guys are enjoying higher recognition today.""
He pointed in particular to PC graphics component supplier Chips and Technologies Inc. stock, which jumped $4.875 to $19.75, or roughly 25 percent, after it released its own strong quarterly earnings report.
"
9,"Chips stocks, especially those of PC-related manufacturers, posted across-the-board gains Tuesday after the release of a monthly industry report showing robust demand in the North American semiconductor market.
Also showing strength in early trading were stocks of companies that make programmable logic devices, including Altera Corp Lattice Semiconductor Corp and Xilinx Inc.  
""I think most of the upside is still coming from the PC industry,"" said Nimal Vallipuram, a Bear Stearns chip analyst. ""I dont think this is information for an industry turnaround.""
The upswing in the industry ratio of chip bookings to orders rose to 1.10 in October from 0.98 in September, while expected to a degree, surprised analysts by its extent.
The report was largely a sign of general industry health, as the ratio offers little insight into specific segments.
Still, it lifted commodity chipmakers, which had stumbled badly recently, including Motorola Inc, up 1-1/8 to 51-1/8 and Texas Instruments Inc, up 1/2 to 56-1/2.  
Microprocessor giant and industry flagship Intel Corp rose 1-1/4 to 125-1/8, while PC graphics suppliers Chips and Technologies Inc swelled 2 to 26-3/8 and Trident Microsystems Inc gained 1-1/4 to 22-1/8.
""The magnitude of the improvement was a surprise, but Wall Street has been expecting an improvement,"" said Mona Eraiba, semiconductor analysts at Gruntal &amp; Co.
Among Eraiba's favorites are market niche players such as VLSI Technology Inc, up 1-1/16 Tuesday to 21-1/8, National Semiconductor Corp, which nudged up only 1/8 to 22-5/8 and Lattice, up 5/16 to 40-1/4.
She also cited Motorola and Texas Instruments, which she considers to have relative upside potential based on the shellacking their stocks have taken in recent quarters.
Vallipuram recommends Intel and Adaptec Inc, which makes PC interconnection devices. He also favors Xilinx and Altera, both up 7/8 to 41-1/4 and 70-3/8, respectively.
Reflecting broad sector strength, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOXX of 16 leading chip stocks gained nearly five points in early trading. At 1039 EST/1539 GMT, the index stood at 3.32, up 1.56 percent on the day with 12 stocks posting gains, two losing ground and two unchanged.

9,"Computer Associates International Inc. is expected to unveil Monday a new Internet division that promises to save businesses from the headaches of seeking numerous vendors now needed to set up and manage a Web site.
The company, which manages Web sites for large corporate customers, also plans to sign up hundreds of thousands of small businesses to use the service whether they own computers or not, sources close to the company said.
In this ""community"" Internet service, neighbourhood businesses such as pizza parlours would contract with Computer Associates to establish an Internet presence, allowing customers to call up a shop's Web site to place an order.
Currently, a company wishing to establish itself on the the Internet is confronted with a maze of separate vendors from which they must buy the necessary hardware, software and consultanting services to put together the disparate elements.
The aim of Computer Associates' one-stop Internet service would be to shoulder all the messy technical responsibilities for customers, allowing them to focus on their own business.
""Computer Associates wants to ride the electronic commerce wave that is coming down the pike,"" said one source familiar with the CA Internet unit strategy. ""CA will provide a company the capacity for electronic commerce (on Web) sites in return for a revenue-sharing arrangement.""
Although not nearly so well known as Microsoft Corp. and other brand name PC software makers, Computer Associates is the world's top mainframe software supplier and the second largest independent software firm overall after Microsoft.
Launching the new business unit is one of several major announcements the company is expected to make at its three-day CA World conference that started Sunday in New Orleans.
In addition, Islandia, N.Y.-based Computer Associates has slated separate press conferences with Microsoft, Intel Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc. Monday and Tuesday.
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech Tuesday evening that is likely to centre on the further integration of Consumer Associates and Microsoft software strategies.
Computer Associates declined to comment on announcements that may be in the works. Specifically, officials would not discuss plans to launch a separate Internet business unit.
But sources familiar with Consumer Associates' plans confirmed that the new Internet unit has been formed to help customers create dynamic Web sites tied to internal corporate database systems.
A special focus would be to make customer information stored on legacy mainframe systems available via the Web.
Web-based electronic commerce tools would tie the system directly to a company's back-office accounting department.
The division will account for only a few hundred out of Computer Associates' 9,000 total employees, the sources said.
The planned business, which has been in the works since April, would be a natural extension of CA's systems management and database products target its existing customer base of the world's largest corporations, as well as smaller firms.
In the pizza parlour example, a customer order would be routed over Computer Associates computers to the local pizza parlour, which would bake the pizza, bill the customer's credit card account and then deliver the order.
Customer data storage would be hosted on Consumer Associates mainframes, an unusual feature compared to the hundreds of other Web service providers, who tend to leave information management in the hands of customers once Web site development work is complete.
In effect, Computer Associates' plans would resurrect mainframe time-sharing, where in companies rent time on remote computers and pay service providers to assume responsibility for the headaches of managing the systems.
Computer Associates stock, which has been trading at historic highs recently, rose $1 to close at $58.25 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.
"
9,"Intel Corp stock surged ahead in heavy trading on the strength of its third quarter earnings report, but while its success fueled gains in the stocks of PC makers, the Intel report did little to buoy other chipmakers.
Still, analysts said Intel's share gains Tuesday remained restrained by uncertainties over whether the third quarter ramp-up might lead to a reduction in fourth quarter orders, a concern magnified by Intel's unwillingness to make forecasts.
At midday Tuesday, Intel stock was up 3-3/8 at 111, after trading as high as 114-1/4 near the opening of trading.  
Stocks of personal computer manufacturers who rely on Intel micrprocessors also showed significant gains, as investors saw Intel's order surge as confirmation of strong demand for the machines themselves.
Compaq Computer Corp was up 1-1/2 to 73-3/8. Dell Computer Corp gained 1-1/4 to 86-1/8. Gateway 2000 Inc swelled two to 55-3/8.
""The Intel report was clearly a positive for the whole PC industry,"" said veteran chip analyst Dan Klesken of Robertson Stephens. ""It is an endorsement of our view that we are in for a strong upgrade cycle for the second half of year,"" he said.  
Chips, a PC graphics chip maker, released its own strong earnings report Monday, with income of $0.42 per share in its first quarter ended September 30 versus $0.20 per share in the year ago fiscal first quarter.
Other gainers in the segment included Trident Microsystems Inc, which was up 7/8 to 20-1/8, after rising nearly two points earlier Tuesday.
Despite these gains, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of 16 leading chipmakers was down 1.69 points on the day to 197.97. There were only three advancers, including Intel, compared with 12 losers. One was unchanged.  
Securities analysts said Intel's latest results demonstrate how fundamentally different it is from other semiconductor makers, operating as it does with a virtual monopoly over microprocessors, the core chips of PCs.
Indeed, Intel has benefited from the pain endured by other segments of the seminconductor industry throughout the past year, especially suppliers of memory chips used in PCs.
Memory chip prices have fallen by 80 percent in the last year.  A 32-megabit memory now sells for one-third less than an eight-megabit memory did a year ago but has four times the processing power, noted Robertson's Klesken.  
Earlier Tuesday, for instance, Texas Instruments Inc, a leading U.S. memory chip maker, reported sharply lower operating income for its third quarter of $44 million versus $289 million a year ago.
Correspondingly, the percentage of revenues Texas Instrument derived from Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) computer memory chips in its recent quarter fell to about 25 percent of company revenues from almost 40 percent last year.
Intel has cut its own prices by up to 50 or 60 percent on processors since last year.  The combined price cuts have spurred order growth Intel is now seeing, Klesken said.  
Robertson's Klesken noted that while the industry revenues are expected to down 10 percent in terms of dollar growth, ""Intel will grow 25 percent in terms of top line, full-year revenues.""
Excluding the wounded memory chip makers, which account for roughly 30 percent of the semiconductor industry, the chip industry is due to grow only five percent worldwide this year.
""That says it all,"" Klesken said adding that, ""Intel is so clearly head and shoulders above the rest of the industry.""  
Intel, which Monday had reported earnings of $1.48 per share in its September quarter, swept past Wall Street's consensus expectations of $1.25 per share for the quarter.
Securities analysts responded Tuesday with a wave of higher earnings estimates for Intel's 1996 and 1997 years.
While trading volume in Intel had reached more than 17 million shares by mid-afternoon, gains in the share price were tempered by lingering questions about whether Intel would see its surge in sales carry through the fourth quarter of 1996.
Intel did not respond directly to such concerns in a conference call with analysts Monday, citing a proposed law on the California ballot in November that would make executives and directors liable for financial forecasts they made.
In addition, some investors appeared to be capturing the recent gains in Intel stock, said Lehman analyst Michael Andrew Gumport, who nontheless reaffirmed his buy rating and set a new 12-month target price of $150 on the stock.
""The stock has done so well that clearly some people are going to take some profits,"" Gumport said.  Intel traded at around 100 only last Thursday.  The stock hovered around 72 in late July.

9,"Coupon clipping is coming to cyberspace.
SaveSmart Inc., a start-up company based in Mountain View, Calif., plans to unveil on Monday a credit card-based scheme to allow computer users to browse for and take advantage of bargains offered by a wide range of local, regional and national merchants.
Consumers will be able to qualify for automated discounts on groceries, dining out, movies, clothing, furniture and auto repairs, among other items.
The company said that using its special credit card eliminates the inconvenience and inefficency of paper-based promotional coupons delivered in newspapers or by direct mail. Industry figures show that only about 2 percent of paper coupons are actually redeemed.
SaveSmart said the service dramatically enhances sales promotions by making it easier for consumers to find and use them, while making them cost-effective for merchants to offer.
""We are driving physical traffic into the merchants' stores,"" said Bernard David, SaveSmart's executive vice president of business development.
Advertising analysts said the new interactive promotion service could play a key role in transforming the industry, which generates about $120 billion a year, according to the media research firm of Veronis, Suhler and Associates.
""All Web promotions need to be attractive in the real world, not just the virtual world of cyberspace,"" said Mary Doyle, a Web marketing analyst for IDC/Link Resources.
What differentiates SaveSmart from thousands of other Internet-based commerce efforts is the linkage the service makes between computer users and actual businesses, she said.
The company's Web site -- www.savesmart.com -- offers an online database of merchant promotions personalized to fit the individual's interests.
Consumers can browse through promotional offerings and when they find a promotion they want, ""select"" it and reserve it. They can then redeem the promotion by presenting the SaveSmart card at a merchant's store at the time of purchase.
SaveSmart targets what it describes as ""neighborhood trading areas"" of roughly 100,000 people.
The service will be launched Monday in the area around Palo Alto, Calif., with service expanding to include the entire San Francisco Bay Area by the end of the year.
In 1997, the company plans to roll the system out in 10 additional U.S. cities where Internet use is most heavily concentrated, including Boston, New York, Washington D.C./Baltimore and Orange County, just south of Los Angeles.
The company said it plans a coordinated direct marketing campaign in each city where the service is introduced to sign up individual card members using mail and newspaper ads.
In addition, SaveSmart said it has been successful in promoting the card as an employee benefit offered by large computer companies.
""Our target is to have tens of thousands of SaveSmart members within each neighbourhood trading area,"" David said, adding that he expected to meet that goal in SaveSmart's first service areas ""within a couple of months, to be quite frank.""
To date, SaveSmart said it has signed up 400 merchants, representing a cross-section of locally available goods and services. McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Subway Sandwiches are participating. In addition, it has agreed to a deal with at least one major movie studio, which it declined to name.
While the system would appear to be a threat to traditional promotional outlets like direct mail marketers and newspaper publishers, SaveSmart said it is working with one leading U.S. household direct marketer and that there is nothing to preclude it from linking up with news publishers.
David said SaveSmart would also make a logical fit with local telephone companies, but declined to say whether the company had reached any such agreements.
The company, which has about 30 employees,. was founded by executives from VeriFone Inc. and other Silicon Valley computer firms. VeriFone is a leading global supplier of merchant credit card transaction terminals.
SaveSmart provides special VeriFone-built terminals to merchants using its credit-card system.
Company officials said SaveSmart is designed to leave open the possibility that the system could be adopted by a major credit card company, so that consumers could use their normal credit card to conduct SaveSmart transactions.
The company has held talks with major credit card companies, but there are no deals to announce, officials said.
SaveSmart has not disclosed its financial backers. Industry consultants familiar with the company said they include Bill Melton, founder of VeriFone, and also CyberCash Inc., an Internet commerce company.
Other backers include members of Germany's Quandt family, who are ranked among the world's richest families, they said.

39,"In yet another sign that utilities are branching out far beyond their traditional markets, PacifiCorp and Protection One Inc. on Friday announced a marketing alliance aimed at boosting customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive industry.
Under the venture, customers of PacifiCorp subsidiaries Pacific Power and Utah Power will be offered a security system from regional alarm company Protection One.
The unusual alliance is viewed as the first of many creative ventures in an uncertain era of utility deregulation.
""This is the start of what is going to happen all over the place. It's a whole new business that will coattail on the aggressive nature utilities are starting to take. One-stop shopping is becoming key from a marketing position,"" said Ron Chebra, manager of utilities and energy industries at AT&amp;T Solutions.
Utilities are becoming increasingly attracted to security companies as they prepare to enter new markets that previously had been off-limits due to federal regulations. In recent months, utilities have bought security firms or made large investments in them.
""We're looking for new products and services that we can bring to our customer base as a way to build loyalty and ultimately build preference with our residential customers,"" said Rene Carroll, consumer products manager at PacifCorp.
""We've been looking at different ways of entering the home security business for over a year,"" she added.
The alliance will give Protection One instant access to the 1.4 million customers served by the PacifiCorp subsidiaries and extends its reach to Utah. Previously, the regional security firm served six western states.
At a recent conference on mergers in the security industry, Protection One officials declined to discuss potential revenue from the alliance, but noted that capturing even 5 percent of PacifiCorp customers would be significant.
Customers accepting the offer will receive free installation of a home security system with the purchase of a two-year agreement for monitoring services.
The security system's alarm panel also will hold thermostat and lighting controls and remote access.
The alliance is expected to be just the first step for Protection One, which is trying to take advantage of new opportunities that are emerging from deregulation of the utilities and telecommunications industries.
""We think this is the first of quite a few announcements we'll be making in the next 12 months or so,"" Protection One Chief Financial Officer John Hesse told Reuters at the recent security conference.
The alliance re-establishes a link between the two companies that was dissolved several years ago. Protection One began as a subsidiary of PacifiCorp in 1988, but the alarm company split off in a management buyout three years later. Protection One then became a publicly-traded alarm company in 1994.

39,"Shares of food and beverage giant PepsiCo Inc rose sharply Thursday on rumors that it could be a takeover target of Philip Morris Cos Inc.
Industry experts flatly dismissed the rumor, saying a pricetag on any potential transaction would be an astounding $60 to $80 billion.
Instead, they said the rumor, just the latest to surface about PepsiCo in recent months, underscores widespread dissatisfaction about the company's outlook.  
""I don't ever say no to anything, but I think this is a farfetched rumor,"" said Martin Romm of CS First Boston.
Officials from PepsiCo and Philip Morris declined to comment on the rumor, citing company policy.
But shares of PepsiCo, which have been active recently, jumped 1-3/8 to 30-1/2 and Philip Morris gained 1-1/8 to 97. Wall Street rumblings began earlier this week and the rumor picked up steam after a Thursday report in the New York Post.  
The New York Post cited a rumor on Wall Street that Philip Morris would offer $50 a share for PepsiCo.
The speculation of a deal with Philip Morris comes less than one month after PepsiCo announced a major plan to pull out of weak international beverage markets.
The restructuring, which called for a charge of more than $500 million against earnings, also included cost-cutting targets and continued focus on its Frito-Lay snack food unit.  
But Wall Street is disappointed with the company's indecision about its casual restaurant business, which has performed below expectations. PepsiCo said it is reviewing those operations and analysts widely expect the company to eventually sell the business.
In the meantime, earnings growth will rest heavily on the strong Frito-Lay division.  
""In 1997, a large (part of PepsiCo earnings) is going to be riding on the shoulders of Frito-Lay. Frito-Lay, in my opinion, has to deliver next year,"" said Skip Carpenter of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, who does not anticipate a major turnaround for the international beverage business until 1998 or 1999.
Analysts said PepsiCo reported third quarter earnings on Tuesday that met expectations, but failed to excite investors.
If PepsiCo sells the restaurant business as expected, the company may pour some of those proceeds into acquisitions to further beef up the solid snack food business, analysts said.  
Analysts also have dismissed recent rumors that PepsiCo would be interested in buying Starbucks Corp. They said a transaction between the two would likely dilute PepsiCo earnings and disappoint investors who want the company to exit the casual dining business.
Both companies declined to comment on the PepsiCo-Starbucks speculation. The two companies are in a joint venture for the production and sale of a cold coffee beverage called Frappucino.  
Philip Morris' huge product line includes Post breakfast cereals, Marlboro cigarettes and Kraft cheese.
"
39,"A financial agreement between Barney's Inc and Hong Kong-based Dickson Concepts International Ltd will open the door to potential bidders for the famed New York luxury retailer.
Speculation about interested buyers has been rampant ever since Barney's filed for bankruptcy nearly a year ago.
Dickson and Saks Holdings Inc previously have expressed interest in privately held Barney's. Neiman Marcus Group Inc and Canada's Holt Renfrew also have been cited by industry experts as potential bidders.  
Barney's has repeatedly said that it is not for sale but only wants to talk with potential investors.
Under the pact announced Tuesday, Barney's will pay Dickson up to $1 million to complete its financial review of Barney's and Dickson will submit a recapitalization proposal.
In return, Barney's, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since January, will make the financial information available to other prospective investors.
""We have the basis by which another investor can look at the information from that due diligence,"" said Barney's spokeswoman Sandra Sternberg.  
The pact with Dickson must be approved by the bankruptcy court, which may consider the issue as early as next week.
Officials at Saks, Neiman Marcus and privately held Holt Renfrew could not be reached for comment.
But Japanese retailer Isetan Co Ltd, which is tangled in court with Barney's over a soured business arrangement, said it was not interested in buying Barney's.
""I don't think we're considering it right now. We're sitting on the sidelines,"" said spokesman Yasuo Okamoto.
Saks and Isetan joined forces in July to explore a plan for Barney's, but they never reached terms on a proposal.  
Although Barney's has shuffled management to help turn around the business, the troubled retailer is still viewed as weak in the luxury retail sector even as other companies are performing well.
However, analysts think a new owner or partner can breathe new life into the company.
""It can be viable going forward. It needs to be trimmed down and it needs merchandising talent,"" said Howard Eilenberg of Johnson Redbook Service.
Founded in 1923 by Barney Pressman and operated under the leadership of his grandsons Robert and Gene, Barney's has long been plagued by a reputation for weak management.
"
39,"Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. so far have convinced the courts that their $8.6 billion merger plan should proceed, but they still need to win over unhappy shareholders who favour Norfolk Southern Corp.'s higher rival bid.
Lawyers and financial advisers were expected in the next few days to consider several plans aimed at persuading investors to approve a crucial measure needed for the deal.
Meanwhile, CSX said Thursday that its $110 cash tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, which represents the first part of its plan to buy Conrail, was oversubscribed.
The proposed stock and cash transaction has angered many investors, who prefer an all-cash $10 billion offer by Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va.
Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer of $110 a share, saying the union with CSX provides more strategic benefits.
But Norfolk Southern refused to give up, on Thursday extending its tender offer through midnight EST on Dec. 16. The offer had been set to expire Friday.
Norfolk Southern said earlier it would also continue to pursue its legal case seeking to block the planned merger.
CSX said that as of Thursday afternoon about 1.4 million Conrail shares had been tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to Norfolk Southern's offer.
Sources close to the companies said no final decision has been made about how to woo Conrail shareholders, but options include sweetening the stock portion of the deal or setting a ""collar"" to guard against price volatility.
They will also consider revising the deal's terms to accelerate payment to investors, according to the sources, who did not want to be identified.
The two companies could also decide to keep the terms unchanged, betting that shareholders will ultimately choose the CSX offer over Norfolk Southern's bid, which cannot be formally considered by Conrail until July.
""There's only one thing they can do and that's to sweeten the offer. I don't know how they're going to get enough votes if they don't,"" said Thom Brown, managing director at investment firm Rutherford, Brown &amp; Catherwood Inc., which holds some 50,000 shares of Conrail.
Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail declined to comment on their plans but acknowledged last week they were discussing increasing the value of the pact upon its consummation.
Sources close to the companies said there is no rush to make a decision, noting that Conrail can easily postpone the shareholder vote that is now slated for mid-December.
CSX and Conrail won a significant victory this week when a U.S. District Court judge denied a request by Norfolk Southern to block the CSX-Conrail deal. An appeals panel also declined to block the first step of the deal.
Norfolk Southern, meanwhile, withdrew its motion for an expedited appeal of the federal court ruling that allowed CSX to buy the 19.9 percent stake in Conrail since the tender offer expired at midnight Wednesday.
But a Norfolk Southern attorney said the company will continue to pursue its legal case seeking to block the Conrail-CSX merger.
""We will continue with the litigation,"" attorney Steven Rothschild said.
A group of Conrail shareholders pursuing a lawsuit and appeal similar to Norfolk Southern's did not withdraw their motion for expedited appeal. The group urged the court Wednesday to hear an expedited appeal and ""sterilize"" the 19.9 percent Conrail stake by preventing CSX from voting it at a shareholders meeting needed for the merger to occur.
Because Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits a company from buying more than 20 percent of another company in a cash tender offer, shareholders will be asked in mid-December to approve a measure that would permit CSX to buy 40 percent.
The CSX-Conrail transaction calls for CSX to buy 40 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share in cash and exchange the remaining 60 percent for CSX stock.
Sources close to the company said Conrail and CSX were well aware of the potential difficulties in winning the necessary votes.
Industry experts believe shareholders may be more willing to approve the 40 percent measure if they were guaranteed more favourable terms for the stock portion of the deal.
""They can't get the vote until they improve the back end of the deal and they know that,"" one takeover specialist said.
Meanwhile, Conrail stock tumbled, reflecting the expiration of CSX's tender offer. The stock fell $2.25 to $94.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Based on Thursday's stock price, the Conrail-CSX transaction values shares of Conrail at about $95.10 each. The stock portion of the deal would be exchanged at a value of about $85.15 for each Conrail share.

39,"Less than six weeks after the collpase of his deal to buy security firm ADT Ltd, Wayne Huizenga on Thursday shifted gears to rental cars.
The founder of Blockbuster Entertainment and owner of the Florida Marlins baseball team announced earlier that his Republic Industries Inc had signed a definitive pact to buy privately-held Alamo Rent-A-Car for $625 million.
The move is expected to catapult Republic's growing automotive business, which is rooted in used-car company AutoNation USA.
"
39,"Fast-growing Republic Industries Inc., which is led by Florida entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga, said Thursday it would buy Alamo-Rent-A-Car Inc. for $625 million in a move to sharply expand its automobile business.
The deal comes less than six weeks after the collapse of Huizenga's $4.3 billion plan to buy security firm ADT Ltd.
""Leisure travel is a fast growing segment of the automobile rental industry and Alamo's innovative leadership in this growth sector of the automobile rental marketplace is consistent with our strategy of building consumer-oriented, service related businesses with recognised brand names and strong management,"" Huizenga said in a statement.
Republic is expected to use Alamo to expand its burgeoning auto business rooted in used-car company AutoNation USA.
Huizenga ""wants to be the largest used-car sales, leasing and rental provider. It makes sense to have the Alamo fleet as a warehouse for his vehicles,"" said Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
Alamo is the fourth-largest rental car company in the United States, with a fleet of about 130,000 vehicles. Alamo operates in 42 states in the United States and has operations in 10 European countries and Canada.
Alamo founder and Chairman Michael Egan, who owns about 94 percent of the company, will continue as chairman of Alamo.
Huizenga said Republic's AutoNation USA car business will benefit from Alamo's strong relationships with manufacturers and other automotive suppliers.
""The combination of Alamo with Republic's 'like-new' automobile retailing concept is an exceptional fit that will enable AutoNation USA to accelerate its business plan and create a unique, dedicated and predictable source of inventory for our megastore distribution system,"" he said.
Republic bought used-car company AutoNation earlier this year and opened its first superstore about two weeks ago in Florida. It plans to open three or four more AutoNation stores this year and quickly expand the chain so there are some 80 stores around the nation by the end of the decade.
AutoNation will be supplemented by Republic's recent $95 million purchase of used-car superstore firm CarChoice Inc.
Investors praised the latest acquisition by Republic, bidding the company's stock up $2.875 to $33.625 on Nasdaq. The deal will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.
In addition to the automotive industry, Republic specialises in electronic security and solid waste companies. Huizenga also owns the professional Florida Marlins baseball, Panthers hockey and Dolphins football teams.
Huizenga suffered a setback in late September when his plan to buy security firm ADT was called off after weeks of uncertainty. Although the stock deal was viewed positively from a strategic standpoint, it fell apart due to volatility in Republic's stock and the inability of the companies to revise terms of the transaction.
Analysts saw little chance of that happening with Alamo.
""I think Alamo provides Republic everything that ADT did, plus more, from the auto side,"" said Jordan Hymowitz of Montgomery Securities, who rates Republic shares as a buy.
Republic also said it will pursue more car deals.
""We're interested in growing in virtually every segment of the automobile industry,"" spokesman Ronald Castell said, citing rental, used cars, repairs and financing.
The acquisition of Alamo marks the latest in a flurry of transactions in the rental car industry.
On Wednesday, ADT said it planned to sell its U.S. auto-auction business, ADT Automotive. The unit is the nation's second-largest automobile auction company, and its sale would mark ADT's complete exit from that business after it sold its European auto-auction unit last year.
Last month, hotel and real estate operator HFS Inc. bought Avis Inc., the world's second largest car rental company, for about $800 million. HFS has said it will pursue another similar acquisition and launch an initial public offering for part of its rental car subsidiary next year.
Ford Motor Co., which owns Hertz, in July announced it was expanding its rental car business with the acquisition of Budget Rent-a-Car. Ford already had owned part of Budget.
Meanwhile, Chrysler Corp. wants to sell subsidiaries Dollar Rent-A-Car and Thrifty Rent-A-Car.
"
39,"USAir Group Inc, determined to expand overseas, soon will be flying solo at a time when most of its competitors are entrenched in international alliances.
Industry experts said the Arlington, Va.-based airline will have a hard time finding a new partner to replace its passenger-sharing pact with British Airways Plc.
""USAir wants to duplicate something like the other major carriers have in Europe, but all the dance cards are already full,"" said one analyst who did not want to be identified.  
Over the past five years, cost-conscious airlines have struck marketing agreements with other carriers in order to extend their reach to new destinations that would be too expensive to serve on their own. Examples include links between Northwest Airlines Corp and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV and between UAL Corp and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
On Thursday, USAir said it would terminate in March its passenger-sharing and frequent flier pact with British Airways due to the British carrier's proposed alliance with powerhouse AMR Corp.  
The move is expected to have little financial impact on USAir, which received far less revenue from the alliance than did British Airways.
Because most of the big carriers already have partners, analysts said USAir is likely to pursue international growth on its own for now.  It already is seeking the right to fly to London's coveted and restricted Heathrow Airport from several U.S. cities.
The desire for an expanded overseas role is also likely to prompt USAir to re-enter old markets, analysts said. It is best-known for its short-haul routes on the U.S. East Coast.  
""It may be that USAir may return to some of those areas,"" said John Steltzer, executive of airline consulting firm Worldwide Transportation Group Inc.
Although USAir has the highest cost structure of all major U.S. carriers, industry analysts said strong profit margins on long-haul flights would likely offset the expense associated with resuming service in some of those areas.
It also is likely to strike alliances with smaller European carriers that could transport passengers beyond any USAir destination.
""That would provide feed for their transatlantic operations, which they would need on that side of the ocean,"" said Raymond Neidl of Furman Selz.
In the longer term, however, many analysts remain convinced that USAir will need an extensive alliance or merger with another carrier.
"
39,"Ashland Inc. Monday announced a wide-ranging restructuring programme aimed at pumping up profitability in an era of weak refining margins and widespread energy industry consolidation.
The move by the Ashland, Ky.-based energy company appeased a New York investment firm, which withdrew its plan for a proxy fight at the company's annual shareholder meeting next month.
""Ashland's No. 1 priority is to improve returns in its refining and marketing segment,"" Chief Executive Officer Paul Chellgren said in a statement. ""Many of the elements in the plan announced today focus on that priority and are aimed at continuing to build a basis for the long-term competitiveness of this business.""
Under the plan, Ashland will restructure its business units to form a petroleum group consisting of its refining businesses, SuperAmerica retail convenience stores and Valvoline motor oil. The group will be led by Ashland executive Fred Brothers, who has run the company's chemicals business.
Ashland also said it will reduce 1997 capital expenditures for Ashland Petroleum to $150 million from $175 million and limit capital expenditures for refining to $100 million. It said the remaining $50 million in Ashland Petroleum's 1997 capital budget will be earmarked for petrochemical and branded marketing expansions.
The company will evaluate alternatives for its exploration unit, with the target of completing an evaluation and any resulting business transaction before the end of 1997.
It will review other options for strategic alliances amid widespread developments in the refining and marketing sector.
Ashland said it will authorise the repurchase of up to 1 million shares of its common stock annually in an attempt to eliminate dilution of its stock.
It also said it was halting a programme to offer up to $100 million in Ashland common stock. To date, about $50 million in common stock has been sold under the programme.
The company said it would evaluate corporate general and administrative expenses.
The actions were viewed as a significant step to convince investors that management will not stand by and watch profits erode.
""The question now is whether they can deliver. I think there will be more to come,"" said Smith Barney analyst James Falvey.
Ashland recently was pressured by Providence Capital Inc., a New York-based investment firm that nominated a three-person slate for election to the company's board of directors at the Jan. 30 annual meeting.
Providence President Herbert Denton said in an interview that he was satisfied by the plan. Representatives of Ashland met with Providence last week.
""They have addressed all the major issues we raised. We feel the plan is genuine and that they are sincere about defining a new era at Ashland,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Ashland stock rose 12.5 cents to $46.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts noted the stock has risen about $10 per share since September on views that a restructuring would be forthcoming.
They said the restructuring was a good reflection on CEO Chellgren, a company veteran who is set to replace retiring Chairman John Hall.
""I think this is positive. This is a quicker-than-expected start on restructuring,"" said Fred Leuffer of Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
"
39,"CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. said Monday they had entered discussions about their rival offers to buy Conrail Inc.
The two railroads did not disclose the specific nature of their talks, but Conrail's stock fell on views that the discussions would dampen the prospects of a bidding war for the Philadelphia-based railroad.
A source familiar with the companies said the discussions began late last week, continued through the weekend and into Monday.
Richmond, Va.-based CSX last month struck an agreement to buy Conrail in a $8.4 billion cash and stock transaction that valued Conrail at $92.50 per share. Norfolk Southern soon launched its own bid of $100 cash per share, or about $9 billion.
Since then, the two companies have been locked in a fight over their rival offers and taken the matter to court.
CSX, which said Norfolk Southern initiated the talks, said the discussions concerned ""a possible sale by the post-merger CSX/Conrail of certain material assets.""
Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern sought to quell speculation that it would abandon its bid for Conrail, saying that it was committed to its offer and has secured more than $15 billion to finance the proposed acquisition.
Norfolk Southern said the talks were started by CSX, adding that they were aimed at promoting competition.
""Our willingness to talk to CSX at its suggestion is consistent with my previously announced position that Conrail cannot be acquired by either CSX or NS without a plan to maintain a balanced competitive structure for Eastern railroad service. While I am heartened by CSX's willingness to discuss these matters, we have no reason to believe that Conrail is prepared to accept that reality,"" said Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode.
A battle for Conrail is viewed as being rife with difficulties for all the companies. Although Norfolk Southern has a higher offer on the table, analysts have said that Pennsylvania's corporate takeover law could be an obstacle to its proposed acquisition.
""This is not a good time to be having a long, drawn-out fight. The quicker they get to this, the better,"" said analyst Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.
Conrail shares had partly recovered from the early steep fall by late afternoon, trading down $1.50 per share at $93.75 on NYSE. CSX rose $1.50 to $44.50 and Norfolk Southern gained $1.375 to $90.75, also on the NYSE.

39,"- Supermarket chain Food Lion Inc. said Thursday it will buy Tampa, Fla.-based Kash n' Karry Food Stores Inc. in a transaction valued at $341 million.
The two companies had been in talks for a transaction earlier this year, but dropped those discussions in August. It was not immediately known when talks resumed.
Under the agreement, Kash n' Karry shareholders will receive $26 per share in cash. The companies also said Food Lion will refinance $221 million of Kash n' Karry debt.
Supermarket chains have been gobbling each other up rapidly in a wave of industrywide consolidation.
The deal came one day after California-based grocery giant Safeway Inc. offered $2.3 billion for the 65.5 percent of supermarket chain Vons Cos. Inc  that it doesn't already own.
Earlier this year, Dutch group Ahold NV bought Massachusetts-based grocer Stop &amp; Shop Cos. for $1.8 billion.
Salisbury, N.C.-based Food Lion is a unit of Belgian retailer Delhaize.
Food Lion is one of the 10 largest U.S. supermarket chains with more than 1,100 stores in 14 states. Kash n' Karry has 100 food stores and other facilities in west central Florida.
Shares of both companies were halted for trading shortly before the market closed. Earlier, Food Lion shares were up 6.25 cents to $8.56 on Nasdaq and Kash n' Karry stock rose 25 cents to $24, also on Nasdaq.
""This agreement will enhance competition in west central Florida by putting the financial resources of Food Lion behind the Kash n' Karry name, enabling Kash n' Karry to position itself more effectively as a viable competitor with the area's major supermarket chains,"" said Tom Smith, chief executive officer of Food Lion.
Food Lion said it planned to invest up to $150 million to improve Kash n' Karry stores in the next four years, with funding expected to come from Kash n' Karry cash flow from operations.
""While allowing us to continue operating our stores under the Kash n' Karry banner, it gives us access to the capital we need to accelerate our store remodeling programme and grow our business,"" said Kash n' Karry Chairman Ronald Johnson.
The companies said the transaction will increase earnings per share for Food Lion and result in cost savings. They were not specific.
They also said the deal, which is expected to close by early 1997, has been been approved by Kash n' Karry's board of directors. The board will also recommend that Kash n' Karry shareholders support the merger.
Institutional investors who together own more than 51 percent of Kash n' Karry common stock also support the deal, the companies said.
Food Lion said it has received a commitment from Chase Manhattan Bank to arrange and syndicate a new credit facility that will replace Food Lion's current borrowing facility and provide financing for the deal.
PaineWebber Inc. submitted a fairness opinion to Kash n' Karry's board and is acting as financial advisor to Kash n' Karry in connection with the transaction.
"
44,"B.A.T industries said on Wednesday it was interested in expanding its British life insurance activities through acquisition but had been put off bidding for mutual insurer Scottish Amicable by the price.
B.A.T. Chief Executive Martin Broughton made the comments as the group, which also has extensive tobacco interests, reported a three percent fall in trading profits at its financial services arm.
Those figures included a 160 million pound ($257.8 million) charge for U.S. environmental claims dating back to the 1960s.
""We've said in the past that the portfolio of brands in our British American Financial Services unit would benefit from filling out in the life broker business,"" said Broughton.
""Too many people were looking at Scottish Amicable, I think it would have turned out to be too high a price.""
Scottish Amicable effectively put itself up for sale in February and is considering bids from Prudential Corp, Abbey National and Australian Mutual Provident.
Broughton's remarks mirrored comments made at the half-year stage that the group wanted to build its presence in the independent financial advice sector which accounts for around half of all British life insurance and pension business.
But B.A.T chairman Lord Cairns refused to comment on speculation that the group had approached Commercial Union as a possible partner.
He did say the company remained open-minded about its future structure, leaving the door open to a possible demerger.
B.A.T owns insurance groups Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star in Britain and Farmers in the U.S.
""We are not wedded to a particular structure... We have an open mind,"" said Cairns.
The unexpected provisioning in the 1996 figures came after a change in the way the group quantified possible environmental claims.
In the past these had been assessed on estimates based on claims experience.
Wednesday's provision followed a study by consultants Tillinghast-Towers Perrin which looked at individual sites in the U.S. to calculate B.A.T's possible exposure.
Given all the available information, the company said today's move would signal an end to such provisioning.
""They do now look fairly well reserved compared with the industry average,"" one analyst said.
In the United States, many companies have moved across to the more prudent way of reserving now used by B.A.T.
Echoing comments from competitors, Broughton said the general insurance trading environment remained difficult in 1996. The company had seen a slight pickup in motor rates but commercial lines remained very competitive, he said.
Excluding the environmental charge, general insurance profits were up three percent at 686 million pounds while life and investment businesses were up 16 percent at 495 million pounds.
Total premium income rose nine percent to 10 billion pounds.
Analysts said the results and comments on the state of the markets were broadly as expected.
Allied Dunbar trading profits rose 32 percent to 203 million pounds over the 12 months, though the comparison was flattered by a 1995 provision for costs associated with the Securities &amp; Investment Board pensions review.
Eagle Star profits fell 135 million pounds to 85 million pounds with competitive markets and the shedding of unprofitable businesses leading to a 12 percent fall in premium income.
Premium income in Eagle Star's life business was 18 percent higher at one billion pounds.
Profits at B.A.T's North American insurance business Farmers rose nine percent to 632 million pounds. Profits at the general insurance management business rose 12 percent to 476 million pounds and in the life business three percent to 156 million pounds. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)
"
44,"Scottish Amicable adviser SBC Warburg is hoping to close the first stage in the sale of the life assurance group with the signing of confidentiality agreements with all potential bidders by the weekend, a source close to the deal said on Friday.
So far three companies, Abbey National, Prudential Corp and Australia's largest life insurer Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) have signed the agreements.
These give the bidders detailed financial information on ScotAm to enable them to finalise their offers.
The agreements go further, however, in preventing the bidder from publicly disclosing any details of the offers and forcing them to accept the ScotAm board's decision as final.
A number of other companies are reported to have expressed interest in ScotAm but have yet to sign the agreements.
One company rumoured to have contemplated a bid, Belgian-Dutch insurer Fortis, is said to have ruled itself out of the auction process, but the company has consistently declined to comment.
Another tipped to make a bid, Dutch group Aegon, has yet to show its hand.
The whole process is expected to take between four and six weeks before a final offer is recommended to policyholders by the ScotAm board.
Mutually-owned ScotAm effectively put itself up for auction earlier this month when it said it was to seek definitive offers from parties interested in acquiring it.
The sealed bid process has come in for some criticism and Warburgs and the ScotAm board are likely to go to great lengths to ensure fairness is seen to be done.
""I suspect they are aware that they may have to give more detail than otherwise they may have done under a controlled auction,"" commented one industry observer.
Abbey National, Britain's fifth largest bank, sparked the auction when it announced at the end of January that it was prepared to make an offer worth up to 1.4 billion pounds ($2.27 billion) for ScotAm.
The move came barely two weeks after ScotAm had published its own proposals to drop its mutual status through a flotation on the London stock market.
Prudential threw its hat into the ring with a 1.9 million pound bid last week, a move which prompted ScotAm to open the way for other interested parties to declare their interest.
Abbey National has said it may raise its offer once it has had access to ScotAm's financial details.
In deciding who wins the race, the question of the value of the bid is likely to include not just how much policyholders get up front but where that money comes from, how much goes into policies and what the bidder can offer in terms of future investment flexibility. ($1=.6167 Pound)
"
44,"Scottish Amicable said on Tuesday it will be giving policyholders information about Abbey National's bid for the company when it details its own proposals to shed its mutual status and float on the stock market.
A spokesman for the life assurer, which has been fighting a public campaign against Abbey's offer said: ""It's obviously only right that we tell policyholders that they made an approach for us...we don't want to hide anything from them.""
It is unclear how much detail will be put before policyholders by ScotAm which has repeatedly rebuffed Abbey demands that the timetable for its demutualisation proposals be stopped to allow policyholders to consider the offer.
ScotAm has also turned down Abbey requests for access to its books or meetings to discuss the bid which values ScotAm at up to 1.4 billion pounds ($2.25 billion).
It includes an immediate 400 million pound minimum payout to policyholders in cash or Abbey shares.
Abbey, Britain's fifth largest bank, has complained that policyholders should have the opportunity to compare the ScotAm proposals with alternative offers based on the same information.
The public campaign between the two companies was stepped up on Tuesday with a full-page advertisement in the form of an open letter to policyholders, promising to give them all the information required to make a choice on the firm's future.
""At the precise moment when calm and considered reflection is of the utmost importance, the accent appears to be wholly on how much can be extracted by way of cash payments in the very short term, rather than on policyholders' long term best interests,"" said the letter which appeared in the Financial Times, the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph newspapers.
It went on to promise that policyholders would be informed if a ""definitive and demonstrably better offer"" was made before any vote on the proposals was taken.
The ScotAm board's fiduciary duty is to policyholders who own the company and there has been speculation that it may be holding off from embracing Abbey in the hope of encouraging other bidders to come forward.
The bid is expected to spark an auction for ScotAm but other interested parties may decide to stay on the sidelines ahead of the publication of ScotAm's float plans within the next week.
""The board obviously has a duty to do the best by policyholders - they should be exploring all the avenues they can. By refusing to cooperate with Abbey they're making things harder for themselves,"" said one fund manager.
Martin Lees, life insurance specialist at ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors tipped Dutch insurance group Aegon and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) as front-runners to enter the race for ScotAm.
AMP had already stated its interest in more British acquisitions and a company that used independent financial advisors as its main means of distribution would be a good fit, said Lees.
Aegon's previous acquisition of Scottish Equitable had demonstrated its ability to provide extra capital to allow aggressive development, he said.
Other companies reported to be interested include the Prudential, the Halifax building society, Dutch group ING Groep and Belgian-Dutch financial services firm Fortis.
All have declined to comment on the reports. ($1=.6237 Pound)

44,"Three companies are expected to be left in the running for control of mutually-owned life insurance company Scottish Amicable at the deadline for final offers on Friday evening.
Insurance groups Prudential Corp and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) and high street bank Abbey National have all been working on offers to be weighed up by the ScotAm board and its advisers SBC Warburg.
A source close to Warburgs said a bidder from outside the three front-runers was not anticipated.
The sifting of the offers is likely to take place behind closed doors with not one of the likely bidders opting to make public details of its proposals.
In an effort to deflect criticism of the sealed-bid process ScotAm had agreed to publish details of offers, if required by a bidder.
For the moment, none have asked it to do so.
""We're not at this stage asking for our bid to be revealed. I think everybody's waiting to see whether anyone wants to have a shootout now - it's a bit of a stand off... it's very much a case of playing by ScotAm's rules,"" said a source close to one of the bidders.
Those rules include confidentiality agreements and an undertaking to accept the board's decision, expected by the end of the month, as final.
ScotAm, based in Stirling in central Scotland, has arranged for an independent tribunal to resolve any dispute arising from the the takeover battle.
The board has repeatedly stressed that the interests of its 1.1 million policyholders will be uppermost in its final decision.
Those interests are not limited to headline figures and upfront payouts but extend to the bidders long-term investment plans.
One of Warburg's main difficulties will be comparing what are likely to be very differently structured proposals, and independent actuaries and the Department of Trade &amp; Industry will be consulted before a decision is made.
Job security for ScotAm's 2,200 employees is also likely to play its part and all three bidders have been quick to calm fears of job cuts at ScotAm.
AMP has said it would consider moving its Bristol-based London Life buisness to Scotland if it won while both Abbey and the Pru have said job preservation in Stirling would be a priority.
AMP, Abbey and the Pru are all that are left of half a dozen companies, including National Westminster Bank and Lloyds TSB who last month signed confidentiality agreements with ScotAm to evaluate the company as a takeover prospect.
The final price -- widely expected to top two billion pounds ($3.2 billion) -- is said to have deterred many from taking their interest further and Lloyds admitted recently that after running the slide rule over ScotAm, it felt the bid premium looked too high.
Both the Pru and Abbey have already said that their original proposals might be increased once they had access to more detailed financial detail on ScotAm.
Abbey's original bid was worth up to 1.4 billion pounds while the Pru's 1.9 billion pound offer included a loan element to bolster ScotAm's life fund.
Those bids came barely two weeks after ScotAm had published its own proposals to shed its mutual status and float itself on the stock market.
AMP has not yet given any indication of what it might be prepared to pay for ScotAm, but is financially strong has said it was keen to make acquisitions in both the British and U.S. market.

44,"Pensions and property group Liberty International Holdings  said on Thursday it might go on the acquisition trail to develop its financial services interests.
The company, 69 percent-owned by South African insurance giant Liberty Life, said it was always open to acquisitions and was willing to use its strong balance sheet to fund them.
""We've got various developments in the financial services area -- unit trusts, pensions and offshore. Those are the areas we want to be in long term and if they lead us into acquisitions that's fine - but we don't feel any pressure to do them,"" said Liberty managing director David Fischel.
Liberty currently has around 380 million pounds ($619.1 million) in cash on its balance sheet though this may have little bearing on the size of any future acquisition.
""We could spend one billion, two billion or 50 million pounds, it depends on the quality of the acquisition,"" said Fischel.
Liberty, which has a 72 percent stake in Britain's fourth largest quoted largest property company Capital Shopping Centres, which it floated as a separate company in 1996, launched a new, low-cost pension vehicle -- PensionStore -- in January.
It also controls Portfolio Fund Management Limited, a British unit trust group with some 50 million pounds under management.
In October, the group announced an alliance with British Telecom and post office fund managers Hermes which it promised would ""demystify"" the British pension market.
At the launch of the venture which offers specialised investment services to the UK pensions industry, Liberty chairman Donald Gordon said he believed pensions would be the fastest growing business in the world over the next 20 years.
The possibility of an acquistion was raised as Liberty reported a seven percent increase in pre-tax profits for 1996 to 100.4 million pounds.
The dividend at 16 pence per share was up 10 percent on the previous year. Liberty shares, however, slipped on the results ending the day 13-1/2 pence lower at 466-1/2 pence.
The advance in profits was helped by the performance of CSC which owns two of Britain's largest out of town shopping centres - Lakeside, Thurrock, east of London, and the MetroCentre, Gateshead, in north east England..
Strong underlying rental growth - up 38 percent at Lakeside - in an improving retailing environment was the main factor behind the performance.
CSC, which has five of the top ten shopping centres in Britain and attracts over 155 million customers annually, was enjoying a ""very good growth phase"" and had a strong position in the market according to Fischel.
The group could grow it further by expanding existing centres or building new ones such as the 250 million pound shopping centre development at Braehead Park, Glasgow, he said.
Shares in CSC climbed 69 percent to 366 pence in 1996. Adjusting for the CSC share price, Liberty's net asset value per share would have amounted to around 500 pence per share at year-end.
The shares finished the day 1-1/2 pence lower at 392-1/2 pence. ($= 0.613 British Pounds)

44,"The London Stock Exchange launched its new integrated trading and information computer system, Sequence 6, on Tuesday, the last stage in a three-year programme to take the London stock market into the next century.
The new system completes the introduction of electronic trading begun at the time of the Big Bang' shake up of the London market in 1986.
It also paves the way for the shift to electronic trading in Britain's largest shares on the transition from quote-driven trading for FTSE 100 stocks next summer.
""We are delighted that Sequence 6 has been implemented successfully, on time and under budget. The launch has gone very well today and the users appear to be very happy,"" said a spokeswoman for the Exchange.
However some market-makers in London said they experienced problems in posting prices on Tuesday, citing difficulties with the Reuters system.
A Reuters spokesman said the company's link to Sequence 6 was operating as planned but that there was an unrelated temporary operational problem with feeds from several European exchanges including London which affected prices in the morning.
The completion of the Sequence programme at a cost of 81 million pounds marks the culmination of an modernisation process by the Exchange and Andersen Consulting which will provide the flexibility to adapt to the future needs of the market place.
It will help ensure that London retains its competitive edge, and reduce ongoing costs for both the Exchange and its participants, the Exchange said.
Sequence 6 will provide the basis for new electronic trading in FTSE 100 shares once the structure of a new order-driven regime is agreed and implemented in 1997.
That will signal the end of the current, quote-driven system where prices are set exclusively by dealers authorised to act as ""market-makers"" and deals struck over the telephone.
It will also enable electronic as well as telephone-based trading in the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and the Seats -- Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service -- market for less liquid stocks.
During extensive market testing over five weekends this summer, the new trading platform succesfully coped with up to five times the average levels of daily activity in the London market, the Exchange said.
The Exchange entered into the outsourcing agreement with Andersen in April 1992 and today's launch marks the final phase of a four-stage delivery process.
The successful completion of the project, on time and nearly five million pounds ahead of budget, will come as a relief to the Exchange after its ill-fated and costly attempt at building a paperless share settlement system - TAURUS - was abandoned four years ago.
The collapse of the project resulted in the resignation of then chief executive Peter Rawlins and subsequent involvement of the Bank of England in supervising the development of Crest, a replacement for the Exchange's antiquated Talisman system.
It may also mark a turnaround in its fortunes after a year which began with the sacking of its chief executive, Michael Lawrence, amid disagreement over how to counter competition from overseas bourses.

44,"Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc said on Friday it would be making a first half provision of 50 million pounds ($81.4 million) after finding mispricing errors in the interest rate options book of its Natwest Markets unit.
The bank said a senior trader had been suspended for ""failure to supervise"", pending the conclusion of an internal inquiry.
A second trader, who had resigned from NatWest before the errors had been discovered, has been reported to the Securities &amp; Futures Authority (SFA) regulator.
NatWest said that no clients had been affected by the discovery, adding that the Bank of England was being kept informed.
The SFA confirmed NatWest Markets had sent it information which it was now studying.
An SFA spokesman said no statement was planned at the moment.
""Clearly we have to look at the information, assess the situation and decidewhat is the next step foward.""
A Bank of England spokesman also declined to comment further.
Dealers were left guessing who was behind the transactions that led to the provision or even whether they took place on an exchange or the over-the-counter options market.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the site for a large part of London's options trading, had no immediate comment on the news.
Options are contracts which give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price in the future.
Mispricing could arise in various ways, for instance, a broker could be given a price from clients but somehow get the price wrong in executing the trade.
One options dealer suggested it could be down to how an individual dealt with issues such as margins on his firm's trades.
""Basically if you're a senior trader or a top person you can actually change prices or positions for margining,"" the dealer said.
One highlight of Natwest Markets' results released earlier this week was a 25 percent rise in profits from what it called ""other dealing"" to 171 million pounds.
That was mainly the result of strong increases in rate risk management products, among them interest rate options.
Derivatives markets have been involved in a string of large losses for companies around the world.
While the exact nature of the ""mispricing errors"" is unknown at this stage, the memory of Nick Leeson's activities in the derivatives market is still fresh in many minds.
The $1.4 billion losses run up by Leeson eventually led to the collapse of Barings in 1995 and its subsequent acquisition by Dutch bank ING .
The banking industry attracted more bad publicity last year after Morgan Grenfell sacked fund manger Peter Young after it was discovered he had breached rules on investing in unlisted companies.
The huge bonuses paid out by banks has been cited by some as one reason for the high risks some, like Leeson, are prepared to take.
Only yesterday Donald Gordon, a leading figure in the financial services industry and chairman of Liberty International attacked the payment of large bonuses by investment banks as a ""massive over-incentivisation of personnel"".
He said it had produced an ""excessively materialistic culture"" in the world's finacial markets which had led to a number of financial accidents and would undoubtedly lead to more dramatic catastrophes in the years to come. ($ = 0.614 British Pounds)

44,"Shares in British insurer Commercial Union (CU) jumped on Friday amid renewed speculation the insurance group may become the next victim in the industry's push to consolidate.
Rumours that a merger were in the offing were given a new lease of life after buying of CU shares late on Thursday. The shares rose on Friday, jumping in late trading to close 19-1/2p at 663-1/2p, ignoring worries about interest rates which sent stock prices across the rest of the London market tumbling.
Tobacco and financial sevices giant BAT Industries has been at the centre of the most recent rumours with reports last weekend that discussions between the two had foundered.
Both companies have maintained their silence on whether discussions have actually taken place but earlier this week BAT said it was keeping an open mind about the opportunities for finding a partner for its financial services arm.
The search for cost savings and economies of scale are behind the latest drive to consolidate in Britain's increasingly competitive and fragmented insurance industry.
New entrants selling insurance over the telephone such as Direct Line have added to competition while the selling of insurance products through banks, building societies and shops is also expected to gather momentum.
Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance combined operations back in July to create Britain's biggest insurer and estimates it will be able to cut costs by 175 million pounds ($289.6 million) annually by 1998, shedding some 5,000 employees in the process.
Like the retail banking industry, insurance companies tend not to be dependent on key individuals and mergers are not fundamentally difficult to achieve, said analysts.
One estimated that cost savings in a tie-up between Commercial Union and BAT Industries could probably add another 20 percent to combined operating profits.
While analysts conceded that reports the company has been discussing a deal with others in the industry may be true, they were quick to point out that such discussions have been commonplace in recent years.
""Anyone who wanted to talk to CU would at least be listened to -- they've got shareholders to consider. But these things are not new. These companies have been talking to each other for as long as I can remember on a regular basis,"" said one analyst.
""But I think CU feels quite capable of controlling its own destiny and I'm not convinced that they would think another insurance company had much to offer.""
The question of which management would come out on top in any merger is another tricky issue and was said to have been behind the breakdown in talks with BAT.
Interest from abroad has also been rumoured with German insurance group Allianz said to have been contemplating a move for CU. General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange have also been linked with CU.
A full-scale takeover is a more remote possibility with the necessary premium on the current share price likely to offset many of the cost savings.
But even a merger would bring with it a multitude of problems and would put questionmarks over relationships built up with banks and financial institutions in its continental European businesses.
""There's pressure on both the non-life and life industries to get together and cut costs and CU is as much a part of that as anybody else. I'm sure that most companies have talked or thought about talking to other companies. Whether anything comes of it or not is a completely different matter,"" said an analyst.
Takeover talk also extended to the insurance broking market late Friday as rumours circulated of a predator stalking Sedgwick Group Plc whose shares closed 5p higher at 125-1/2p.

44,"The second large merger between insurance brokers in the space of a week highlights the dilemma many in the industry face over how to counter overcapacity and increasing competition, analysts said on Monday.
The latest move, a 300 million pound ($500 million) merger between Britain's Lloyd Thompson Group and JIB Group comes hard on the heels of last week's $1.23 billion acquisition of New York's Alexander &amp; Alexander Services (A&amp;A) by U.S. broking giant Aon Corp.
Different in scale, the two deals are also very different in motivation but both point to a clear trend in the sector -- consolidation.
Vast overcapacity in broking has left the industry struggling in recent years.
The Aon/A&amp;A deal was driven by a desire to attack costs, increasingly seen as one of the few ways forward for an industry beset by falling rates and declining revenues.
But the merger of Lloyd Thompson and JIB to create Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group is different. It has not been prompted by a search for cost savings but by an effort to release the benefits from the two companies' ""complementary"" businesses.
Cost savings will be restricted largely to the companies' London operations and the opportunities to build upon each others existing businesses, particularly in Asia Pacific, will be the main drive in future growth, according to Lloyd Thompson chief executive Ken Carter.
However, elsewhere in the sector the need to find ways of offsetting the pressure on rates by stripping out costs, like Aon, has raised the prospect of further deals to come.
Rumours that Aon or Marsh &amp; McLennan were about to launch a takeover bid for British-based broker Sedgwick swept the insurance markets on Friday.
Such rumours are fuelled by the the hand-in-glove nature of the business, say analysts.
""The brokers are constantly in discussions about mergers; they chat all the time. And one is always surprised by seeing the industry bash on, trying to purge overcapacity through consolidation,"" said one analyst.
One of the main problems with any merger between brokerages is defection of staff. Another is the diminishing number of would-be predators.
While Aon refused to comment on Friday's Sedgwick rumours, a spokeswoman for the company did point out the need to ""digest"" its most recent prurchases.
The newly merged Jardine Lloyd Thompson will be positioned between global brokers such as Britain's Sedgwick and Willis Corroon and smaller niche brokers such as Lowndes Lambert and C.E. Heath. It is also likely to leave them in something of a dilemma.
As the number of more obvious deals are done, the pressure on those remaining to come up with a means of remaining competitive is likely to rise. Mergers or acquisitions may, however, become less attractive as the more logical tie-ups in the sector are done, leaving those left with fewer options.
""Brokers are all cutting costs but if rates continue to fall, they'll all be cutting back to keep up with the revenue stream coming down. There has to be a huge shock to the industry which will take out a few of the players. Until that happens brokerage isn't going anywhere,"" said one analyst.

44,"British life assurer Scottish Amicable said on Thursday it planned to shed its 170-year-old mutual status in favour of a stock market flotation aimed at taking advantage of opportunities for profit growth.
The Stirling-based group outlined plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in three to five years' time and said it would pay policy-holders an initial special bonus of 75 million pounds ($125 million) after demutualising on May 1.
Scottish Amicable said pay-outs would be based on the length of time policies had been held by members.
The fist payment would be followed by benefits worth more than 200 million pounds as a result of flotation, which will give the group access to long-term capital, it added.
The group said it expected to have a market capitalisation of around 1.0 billion pounds on flotation.
Scottish Amicable said significant opportunities existed for profitable growth in its businesses. But it said in a statement that to take full advantage ""requires access to external capital in both the short and long term.""
There has been intense speculation that Scottish Amicable, founded in 1826, would be the subject of a takeover bid but chairman Sandy Stewart said the group intended to hold on to its independence.
""Our plans do not include being gobbled up by anybody,"" he told a news briefing.
The group said the process would be in two stages. Under the plan, the business, staff and operations of the group would be transferred to a new company, Scottish Amicable Life, a 100 percent subsidiary of newly formed Scottish Amicable Holdings.
The first stage involves a deal with reinsurance giant Swiss Re and its affiliate Securitas Capital ""to provide substantial financial backing initially totalling 395 million pounds"".
Under this agreement Scottish Amicable's existing with-profit fund will receive an immediate cash contribution of 350 million pounds ""from the reinsurance by Swiss Re of certain categories of existing policy"".
Securitas Capital has committed to invest up to 45 million pounds in return for approximately 20 percent of a new business fund being set up to transact all new business from the date on which the scheme becomes effective.
Swiss Re has also agreed to provide further reinsurance ""expected to reach a level of 150 million pounds over the next five years in respect of future new business"".
Scottish Amicable said Roy Nicolson, currently managing director of the group, would become group chief executive of Scottish Amicable Holdings, while Paul Bradshaw, deputy managing director, will become chief executive of Scottish Amicable Life.
Policyholders must first approve the plans at a special general meeting expected to be held in March. The group said detailed discussions had already been held with Britain's Department of Trade and Industry. ($1=.5958 Pound)

18,"Two very different Cambridge biotechnology companies set out their plans to join the stock market on Monday.
Cambridge Antibody Technology Group Plc (CAT), which uses human antibodies to discover new drugs, and the Bioscience Innovation Centre, which aims to ""incubate"" new biotech businesses, both hope to raise millions of pounds to fund their work.
Sources close to CAT said its listing later this year should raise between 30 and 35 ($48-57 million) through a placing of its shares with institutional investors, valuing the company at around 85 million pounds.
Kleinwort Benson Ltd has been appointed as sponsor to the flotation, with Cazenove &amp; Co as broker.
CAT, which has been operating since 1990, is working to find drugs to tackle inflammation, fibrosis, cancer and obesity.
It said two drugs were expected to enter human clinical trials this year. CAT plans to develop drugs on its own up to intermediate stage clinical trials, and then find partners to help fund the costly business of late-stage trials, registration and marketing.
The strategy would enable the company to keep a higher percentage of profits from drug sales than if it introduced a partner early on, but will also increase its costs.
The Bioscience Innovation Centre (BIC) said it hoped to raise up to 6 million pounds through a share placing and open offer, and to list its shares on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).
The money will go towards the construction of a 20,000 square foot building in Cambridge which will act as a ""business incubator"", offering technical and commercial skills to budding biotechs.
""In the U.S, sector-specific business incubators have been shown to have a positive and dramatic effect on the success rate and growth of start-up businesses,"" BIC said.
It added that the planned centre would give suitable companies access to ""professionals in the fields of intellectual property, commercial management, licensing, marketing, regulatory affairs and finance.""
Teather &amp; Greenwood have been appointed as advisers and brokers for BIC's flotation.

18,"Healthcare group Smith &amp; Nephew Plc reassured analysts on Monday that it was set to report a solid performance for 1996, despite continuing tough market conditions and the impact of a strong pound.
The company, which is due to announce full-year results on March 4, told an analysts' meeting that little had changed from its last update in October, when it reported that operating conditions and price pressures in the key U.S. market remained difficult.
Analysts who attended Monday's meeting said Smith &amp; Nephew, which reported a 7.4 percent rise in first-half sales to 540 million stg, was likely to report an increase in full-year sales of between six and seven percent from the 1.03 billion stg achieved in 1995.
They said there were also signs that profit margins could have turned out better in the second half of the year than the first.
Another positive aspect of the meeting was a signal that sales in the highly competitive U.S. market, which accounts for around 40 percent of turnover, had seen a two percent improvement in the second half of the year after gaining just one percent in the first half.
Prices in the U.S. for Smith &amp; Nephew's products in areas including orthopaedic implants and wound management are being forced down by increasingly powerful health providers.
Shares in the company, which had been trading close to their 12-month lows of 174 3/4, rose 4 3/4 pence to 182 3/4 in early afternoon trading. The stock had reached record highs of 217 1/2 pence in June amid hopes for a novel skin replacement product, Dermagraft, currently being developed with Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc of the U.S.
BZW analyst Steve Plag said the shares had taken a ""phenomenal pounding"" in recent months as over-optimistic predictions for Dermagraft had been reined back, and had taken some support on Monday from the absence of bad news.
""There are signs that the second-half revenue performance was a bit stronger, which is encouraging, and there was some reassurance on Dermagraft, but the full picture (on Dermagraft) won't be available until April.""
Another analyst, who asked not to be identified, said Smith &amp; Nephew had been ""very upbeat"" about the the skin replacement product, which would initially be targeted at foot ulcers.
""I think Dermagraft is potentially a very significant product for the company,"" he added.
Analysts said the technology, which enables cells derived from babies' foreskins to grow on a naturally-absorbable scaffold across wounds, could add up to 20 pence per share to Smith &amp; Nephew's value if it succeeded.
SocGen analyst Alyson Coates said she was happy with the current value of the shares, which reflected a balance between limited growth prospects in the next 12 to 18 months and ""the promise of the pipeline,"" including Dermagraft.
SocGen believes that in addition to Dermagraft and similar high-tech products, Smith &amp; Nephew will use its financial strength for acquisitions to help lift growth above the ""pedestrian"" in the medium term.
Coates said she might shave 1 million stg off her full-year pre-tax profit forecast of 185 million stg to take account of the impact of sterling's strength on the group in the last three months of 1996.
BZW's Plag said full-year pre-tax profit forecasts in the range of 183 to 186 million stg ""would be sensible.""

18,"Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group Plc took advantage of its new-found independence on Tuesday to buy the world's biggest maker of handrolling tobacco papers.
Imperial, which was demerged from conglomerate Hanson Plc last October, said it was paying 168 million pounds ($272.7 million) for Netherlands-based Rizla International BV, as well as acquiring 17 million pounds of Rizla's debt.
Chief executive Gareth Davis told Reuters that Rizla, which employs more than 700 people in France, Belgium and Wales, would enhance the group's international expansion.
""Imperial Tobacco is a relatively late entrant to international markets but is making some very fast strides in growth,"" Davis said.
Rizla has a large market share in seven or eight European countries, he said.
Shares in Imperial, which will finance the deal out of bank borrowings, rose 9.5 pence to 394 as traders greeted the news.
Founded in 1796, Rizla is the world's largest producer and seller of the thin papers used for handrolling cigarettes. It has around 66 percent of world market share in branded products.
Davis said the company was active in more than 60 countries, adding: ""Obviously we are looking to extract the potential we see at Rizla for increased profitability and productivity.""
Davis said Imperial had been able to take advantage of its new-found independence from Hanson.
""It is a company we have been interested in for many years,"" he said, adding that the acquisition was ""very much in line with our strategy at demerger of focusing on tobacco and tobacco-related products.""
No job losses are anticipated as a result of the acquisition. ""We do see scope for productivity improvements but the plants are working at capacity,"" Davis said.
Imperial said Rizla, which is based in Breda, would continue to be run as a separate division, with the existing management remaining in place.
In 1996, Rizla posted a trading profit of 23 million pounds on sales of 74 million pounds, and had net tangible assets of around 17 million pounds.

18,"U.S. power utility Dominion Resources Inc will have to reconsider the price it is prepared to pay for East Midlands Electricity Plc if it is realistic about acquiring it, analysts said on Thursday.
On Wednesday Dominion's interest in East Midlands was flushed out by U.K. stock exchange regulators after East Midland's share price jumped by 13 percent.
But Dominion said it would not go much above Wednesday's closing price of 608 pence, valuing East Midlands at just over 1.2 billion stg ($1.97 billion), and industry sources said it would ""run away"" if the market drove the price up further.
Investors seemed to take Dominion at its word on Thursday, and with no bid on the table East Midlands' share price slipped back 21 pence to 587 in midafternoon trading.
But analysts said an offer would be most unlikely to succeed at 610 pence, valuing East Midlands less highly than Northern Electric Plc, which is subject of a 659 million stg bid from U.S. energy group CE Electric.
SG Strauss Turnbull analyst Marshall Whiting said Dominion was being ""very cheeky.""
Dominion's declaration of interest follows hard on the heels of CalEnergy Co Inc unit CE Electric's 630 pence offer for Northern last week.
Using median forecast figures gathered by Edinburgh Financial Publishing, CE Electric's offer represents a P/E ratio of 9.3 against Northern's prospective year through March 1997 earnings and 8.6 times year through March 1998 earnings.

18,"British building materials group Blue Circle Industries Plc produced the first tentative signs of a turnaround at its troubled European heating operations on Tuesday and set out ambitious plans for a ten-fold increase in operating profits at the division over the next three years.
The recovery in the heating sector, together with continued strong performance in the highly profitable Chile and Malaysia markets and the USA, helped lift Blue Circle's interim pretax profit by 11.7 percent to 116.3 million pounds ($181.5 million), at the top end of analysts' forecasts, with the interim dividend rising by 6 percent to 4.25 pence.
The heating operations, which are undergoing a major restructuring focused on France, Germany and the Britain, posted operating profits of nine million pounds in the six months to June, up from just 100,000 pounds a year before.
However, Britain's biggest cement producer also warned that it sees ""no significant signs of recovery"" in the key British cement market, and against a backdrop of a weak stock market Blue Circle shares slipped 5.5 pence to 373.5 pence by 1105 GMT.
Blue Circle chief executive Keith Orrell-Jones told Reuters the group's aim of achieving annual cost savings of 25 million pounds from restructuring heating is ""well up to programme,"" with nine million pounds coming through this year and the full benefit seen in 1997.
Orrell-Jones said he is confident the group can achieve a 15 percent return on its 600 million pound investment in the struggling division, or some 90 million pound, within three years, despite sluggish economic performance in Germany and France.
""We are disappointed with the performance of the economies of both those countries, and we think it is not likely to ease very rapidly,"" said Orrell-Jones, adding ""that is why we set a three-year time horizon"" for recovery.
Blue Circle blamed a 24 percent drop in operating profit at the British cement operations on low infrastructure investment and ""weak new housing starts."" Orrell-Jones said the full-year outcome will be better than the first half, but he does not expect any real upturn until next spring.
With gearing a miniscule 1.5 percent at the end of June, Orrell-Jones confirmed Blue Circle is actively looking for opportunities to expand.
""We'd like to grow our cement business: it depends on where the opportunities crop up. In the U.S. it's a question of waiting for the right opportunity and the right time in the cycle,"" he said.
Blue Circle is ""actively looking in South-East Asia, and we are taking a very careful look at India,"" he said, adding that it is also interested in expanding its south American operations beyond the fast-growing Chile market.

In an update of its product portfolio, Medeva also announced a tie-up with small drug discovery group Peptide Therapeutics Plc which could see painful injections against illnesses such as influenza, typhoid and tetanus replaced by nasal sprays or capsules.
The two are also investigating a vaccine against the E-coli bacteria, which has killed 17 people in a recent outbreak in Scotland. Medeva said it spent three million pounds ($4.90 million) taking a 2.5 percent stake in Peptide, whose shares soared nearly 20 percent to 289 pence.
But the market's main focus was on prospects for the hepatitis B vaccine, Hepagene, which many analysts see as a huge potential money-spinner. In an interview with Reuters, Medeva chief executive Bill Bogie said Hepagene could eventually sell ""millions of doses"" a year, and carry a three-figure price tag.
The vaccine is targeted at a significant group of people who do not respond to existing Hepatitis B vaccines, such as SmithKline Beecham Plc's Engerix-B.
Medeva sees a large market for it, especially among health workers and police who are routinely protected against the infection.
Still more exciting is the drug's potential to treat people who are already infected with Hepatitis B, which is 100 times more infectious than HIV and kills two million people a year around the world. Bogie said tests on people who do not respond to the current treatment, Interferon, showed a 38 percent response rate.
Medeva will decide later this year whether to expand production capacity for Hepagene at its plant in Speke in northwest England or to look elsewhere for extra output.
A major surprise was Medeva's declaration that it would seek regulatory approval for Hepagene in Europe and the United States in 1998, opening up the prospect of first sales in 1999. Bogie said this was a sign of confidence that Medeva would win outstanding battles over patents on both sides of the Atlantic.
It won a key judgement in Britain's House of Lords against U.S. rival Biogen Inc last year. Bogie said Medeva would not be seeking marketing partners for Hepagene beyond its existing agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson to sell Hepagene in southeast Asia.
""We are not looking for a partner. That does not mean they won't happen but we are fairly confident we can do it ourselves,"" he said.
Medeva, whose executives spent Thursday morning with analysts, also announced plans to go ahead with development of a purified form of its most profitable product, the behaviour-controlling drug Methylphenidate.
Bogie said the new version of the drug being developed by Chiroscience Group Plc would give Medeva important patent advantages over rivals and cut down the number of times a day Methylphenidate is taken.
The drug is used to control attention deficit disorder in children and young adults. It is widely used in the United States but Bogie said it was starting to be more accepted in Britain and Europe. ($1=.6119 Pound)

18,"Milumil babymilk powder, used by around 25,000 mothers in Britain and Ireland, was withdrawn from from stores and clinics on Friday after a scare over Salmonella poisoning.
Milupa, part of the Dutch specialist food producer Nutricia NV, said it was withdrawing its Milumil milk powder in Britain because of an unconfirmed link with 12 cases of a rare form of the Salmonella bug.
The company later followed suit in Ireland after consultations with the Irish government, despite saying that no incidents had been reported there.
The company was forced to launch a damage limitation exercise after it was contacted by Britain's Department of Health on Thursday afternoon.
Government scientists had identified 12 cases of Salmonella anatum infection, leading to gastro-enteritis, in children under 12 months old which followed consumption of the French-made milk, sold as ""Milumil for Hungrier Bottle Fed Babies.""
The Health Department said that only two of the children involved were admitted to hospital and all had since recovered. However it told parents and other carers to stop using the product immediately and ordered the withdrawal of all stocks.
""There is no direct, incontrovertible proof that (the cause) is Milumil. It is a statistical association but we have to take every precaution,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
Shares in Nutricia were suspended for around an hour in Amsterdam after falling sharply. However they later recovered much of their losses, closing down 9.70 guilders at 267, above a low of 260.50 guilders.
Milupa said it would hold a thorough investigation at the French plant where the milk was made, and added that production of the product had been suspended.
Sales of Milumil milk powder total between six and seven million pounds a year, and the product has a market share of around five percent. Another Milumil product, Milumil Ready to Feed, is not affected.
Dutch-based Nutricia, which also owns the Cow &amp; Gate brand, is no stranger to controversy.
In June 1993, it withdrew all of its powdered baby food products in the United States because of possible Salmonella contamination.
And 140 million guilders were wiped off the value of the company in November of the same year after it recalled batches of its Olvarit baby food when excessive levels of disinfectant were found in some samples.

18,"General Motors Corp's decision to invest 300 million stg in its U.K. operations reflected confidence in its Vauxhall Motors unit and international prospects for the Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday.
Vauxhall said the three-year investment will be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.
The announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.
Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly told Reuters in an interview that a decision on increasing the number of shifts worked at the plant to three from two to be taken over the next two years could create hundreds more jobs.
Any decision would depend on ""what the market is then and the demand for the model is at the time.""
The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boosting its position.
Reilly said the 300 million stg investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of Ellesmere Port from a domestically-oriented plant to ""a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors.""
He forecast strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Reilly said the British car market is currently ""the most competitive in Europe"", with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars that remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained ""flat,"" he added.
Vauxhall hoped to keep its market share at around 14.5 percent in 1996, and Reilly said its profitablity is ""going in the right direction"" after a tough 1995.
Last year, a stagnant car market saw the GM unit's profits slump to three million stg from 79 million in 1994. ($1=.6317 Pound)

18,"Shareholders in tiny British healthcare group Enviromed Plc staged a bloodless coup on Friday, toppling the embattled company's board.
The gentlemanly storming of the barricades around Enviromed's Knightsbridge headquarters was led by Ron Zwanziger, chief executive officer of Enviromed's biggest shareholder, U.S. company Selfcare Inc.
Zwanziger has watched the value of Selfcare's 29 percent stake in Enviromed dwindle as the share price plummeted from around 112 pence per share in December 1994 to around 25 pence, in line with a collapse in the group's profitability.
Selfcare, which produces tests for pregnancy and infectious diseases, asked shareholders to back its plans to remove four members of the board, led by managing director Thomas Murphy, at an extraordinary meeting on Friday.
But after weeks of charge and counter-charge by both sides, the expected showdown in the unlikely setting of Dean's Yard, next to Westminster Abbey, turned out to be a sedate rubber-stamping exercise.
The board of Enviromed, which produces specialist enzymes and diagnostic equipment, spiked the guns of its opponents by conceding defeat after proxy votes showed 49 percent backing for Selfcare and just under 39 percent supporting the status quo.
A brief show of hands was sufficent to confirm the handover of power and the new board, with Selfcare's Zwanziger as non-executive chairman, was already holding its first meeting as individual shareholders continued to drift in.
This was Zwanziger's second attempt to get rid of the board, which he quit in April 1995 over differences involving a joint venture between Selfcare and Enviromed. Resolutions demanding the board step down were withdrawn just before the start of another extraordinary general meeting in February 1996.
Zwanziger accused Enviromed of eroding shareholder value through poor management and of holding firesales of assets, including the disposal of a dental distribution business and veterinary diagnostic operation, as it sought to cut debts.
In turn Enviromed accused Zwanziger of trying to gain control of the company ""via the back door"", and challenged him to launch a full takeover bid.
Enviromed's value began to plunge in December 1994, the month that Murphy was appointed, as a pretax profit of 2.2 million stg in the year to September 1994 turned into a loss of 8.2 million stg a year later. The company's market capitalization fell from around 28 million stg to just over 6.0 million.
Murphy vehemently rejected blame for the collapse, saying he had inherited a pile of problems he and other board members had worked hard to resolve.
One of the new board's first goals will be to appoint a finance director. In a letter to shareholders ahead of the extraordinary meeting Zwanziger said the new board would focus on the development of the enzyme buisness Biozyme which it said was already profitable.

18,"Rumours Swiss drugs group Roche Holding has designs on Anglo-American group SmithKline Beecham Plc need to be treated with intense caution, analysts said on Wednesday.
Shares in SmithKline Beecham Plc rose sharply in late trading, closing up 30 1/2 pence at 788, while in Zurich shares in Roche dropped 140 Swiss francs to 9,830 francs.
Analysts said rumours that Roche was trying to put together a funding package of up to 50 billion Swiss Francs had fueled the late buying of SmithKline.  
But one analyst with a European bank who asked not to be named said rumours about Roche, which has most commonly been cited as a suitor for another British company, Zeneca Group Plc, have become a regular feature of the market.
Both Roche and SmithKline declined to comment on the speculation.
SmithKline had a market capitalization of around 21.3 billion stg at the close of trading on Wednesday and analysts said a hostile bid would probably lead to a 30 to 40 percent premium on top of this.  
Roche, which is worth 95.1 billion Swiss francs, already has a cash pile of around six billion Swiss francs to fund any ambitions it might have.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull's director of equity research Paul Diggle said: ""Don't hold your breath, but it isn't that stupid."" But Diggle said an agreed merger between the two companies was more feasible than a takeover. He noted that Roche and SmithKline, which are both in the world's top 10 in terms of sales, have made no secret of their desire to be bigger in a rapidly consolidating drugs market and a merger could ""satisfy the ambition of both companies.""  
A merger would give Roche and SmithKline Beecham a combined world market share of over five percent, putting them on a par with current world leader Glaxo Wellcome Plc.
SmithKline would also offer Roche a much firmer footing in the key U.S. market, where it lacks critical mass. Roche's vitamin business, which is the biggest in the world, would provide a useful fit with SmithKline' consumer healthcare and over-the-counter drugs operations.
In terms of drugs, both companies have strong portfolios of central nervous sytem drugs and antibiotics.
However, a UK brokerage analysts, who also declined to be identified, said that, beyond size, a merger with SmithKline would offer little in the way of attractions for Roche.
""If I was the finance director of Roche I would look at SmithKline and see there was a lot of stuff I didn't want,"" he said. SmithKline's involvement in the U.S. pharmacy benefit management business would offer few attractions to Roche, whose drugs are targeted largely at hospitals, he added.

43,"China has urged the devoutly Buddhist region of Tibet to embrace atheism to counter the influence of the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and to raise itself out of poverty.
Beijing also lashed out at the European Union for allowing a meeting between officials of the European Parliament and the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing accuses of covertly working for independence for his Himalayan homeland.
""We have expressed our intense dissatisfaction and serious protest to the European side,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing on Thursday when asked to comment on the meeting.
To check the influence of the Dalai Lama, China called on officials in the restive region to preach atheism and instill socialist beliefs.
""To carry out atheistic education is a neccesary condition for...opposing the Dalai Lama's disastrous teachings aimed at causing chaos in Tibet and splitting the motherland,"" the Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.
""Many people have been fettered by religion and cannot break free of its bewitchment,"" the newspaper said in its October 14 edition.
Beijing vehemently denies accusations by western rights groups of widespread human rights abuses and religious persecution, pointing to rising living and health standards in the remote mountainous region.
The newspaper said traditional Buddhist beliefs, such as canons against killing animals, including pests, had hampered development of the backward and sparsely populated region.
""A lot of technology, because it violates religious tenets, is difficult to put into widespread use,"" it said.
The newspaper accused the Dalai Lama of seeking to split Tibet from China and of using his faith both as a weapon against the Tibetan people and as a shield to protect himself from criticism.
""In order to expose the Dalai's trick of keeping the people ignorant and to smash the Dalai's plot to split the motherland...we should implement atheist education,"" it said.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive revolt against Chinese rule and won the Nobel Peace Prize 30 years later for his peaceful campaign for autonomy.
During his meeting with European Parliament officials in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday, the Dalai Lama reiterated the call for autonomy for Tibet.
""The action of the European Union is open support and connivance with the splittist activities of the Dalai Lama,"" Shen said.
The Dalai Lama's comments to EU officials were restrained, dismissing any notion of economic sanctions against China over its rule in Tibet and advising that it would be wrong to try to isolate China.
The Dalai Lama frequently meets foreign leaders in a globetrotting campaign to win autonomy for his homeland. China has vehemently opposed such meetings.
A meeting between the Dalai Lama and Australian Prime Minister John Howard last month infuriated Beijing, which demanded that Canberra rectify its mistake or face possible trade retaliation.

43,"Xujiachong village in central China's Hubei province is nestled in a lush, narrow valley dotted with whitewashed concrete houses, small cabbage patches and freshwater fish ponds.
Ruddy-cheeked children peer out of ill-lit doorways while farmers steer belching tractors along dirt roads lined with orange trees, their verdant branches heavy with the bright, tart fruit.
Xujiachong is much like any other village in China, except that it is scheduled to be wiped off the map by the end of next year.
The village of 2,480 people is just one of hundreds of towns and hamlets that will be flooded by the silt-laden waters of the Yangtze river when the mighty waterway is diverted in November 1997 as part of the giant Three Gorges dam project.
""The total number of people to be relocated under the Three Gorges project, those in submerged areas, is now 840,000,"" said Wang Jiazhu, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Co that is building the mammoth dam.
""We are estimating there could be a million or 1.2 million at most, taking into account the population increase during the 17 years of construction,"" Wang said.
In Yichang county, site of the future dam, more than 12,300 people have been resettled from the sprawling construction site that flanks the broad, snaking river, said Wang Jiangyi, deputy director of the Yichang Resettlement Bureau.
Evacuation of the giant reservoir area -- to cover more than 600 square km (230 square miles) -- began in 1994 and will involve moving about 100,000 people from Yichang county alone, Wang Jiangyi said.
LEAVING ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS
The fates of hundreds of thousands of households in Hubei and neighbouring Sichuan province were sealed in 1992 when Beijing ended seven decades of debate to give the green light to start work on the gargantuan dam that is to harness the power of the world's third longest river.
Beijing hopes the project, to be completed in the year 2009, will help to power China's economic charge in the 21st century and bring an end to disastrous flooding that has claimed the lives of more than 300,000 people in this century alone.
Officials say they have run into opposition from many local residents unwilling to abandon their ancestral homes and traditional lifestyles.
""There are residents who aren't willing to move,"" said Wang Kaidong, village chief of Xujiachong, which is just two km (1.2 miles) from the dam site.
""It is understandable that they don't want to leave the homes their families have occupied for generations,"" she said.
IDEOLOGICAL WEAPONS AND CASH CARROTS
Communist Party officials have tried to combat anti-relocation sentiment by preaching traditional communist values of self-sacrifice while holding out cash and material incentives.
""The magic weapon of our party is ideological work,"" said Wang Kaidong. ""We talk face to face with residents about the resettlement policies and compensation standards.""
Of the project's estimated 204 billion yuan ($24.6 billion) cost, about 40 billion yuan has been earmarked to finance the resettlement, said He Gong, a deputy general manager of the Three Gorges Development Co.
Government work teams have fanned out through the countryside offering compensation to residents based on the size and quality of their houses and farms that will be committed to the watery mass grave.
Total compensation for each family ranges from 30,000 to 80,000 yuan and those being resettled to rural areas are to receive parcels of land to build new houses on, Wang Jiangyi of the resettlement bureau said.
Blocks of apartment buildings have sprung up to house those moving into urban areas to be employed in factories or tertiary industries, Wang Jiangyi said.
Relocated families will also enjoy preferential charges for electricity, water and road use and will be allowed to make two moving trips free of charge, Wang Jiangyi said.
If ethical campaigns and cash rewards failed to convince the stubborn to pack up, authorities could still resort to the force of law, Wang said.
""In the resettlement process, if there is any case of... disrupting the public order that prevents the process from proceeding smoothly...it will be dealt with in accordance with punitive public security regulations,"" he said.

43,"China has sentenced two veteran democracy activists to hard labour for up to three years, a fellow dissident said on Saturday.
Authorities in Taiyuan in central China's Shanxi province sentenced Fu Guoyong to three years of re-education through labour, the dissident told Reuters by telephone.
Fellow activist Chen Ping, who had worked with Fu on pro-democracy tracts, had been sentenced to one year of labour reform, said the dissident who asked not to be identified.
""The reason was because they published articles abroad about democracy,"" said the dissident. ""They just wrote some articles. There really was no reason for this.""
Authorities had branded the essays counter-revolutionary, said a statement by the Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
Taiyuan police detained Fu, 29, in late July for what they said were illegal political activities.
Chen, 45, had been arrested in Taiyuan in August and was sentenced together with Fu, the source said, adding he did not know when the sentences had been passed.
Police in Taiyuan contacted by telephone declined to comment on the cases. Family members were not available.
Fu moved to Taiyuan in late June, complaining of repeated harassment by police in Hangzhou city in the eastern province of Zhejiang, where he had been living with his wife.
Fu previously served two years in a labour camp for his role in the student-led demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life on June 4, 1989.
Police detained Fu for more than a month in December 1995 after he, along with dissidents Wang Donghai and Chen Longde, wrote a letter calling for the release of Wei Jingsheng, widely regarded as the father of China's modern democracy movement.
Fu also joined in an appeal with Wang and Chen Longde to China's parliament before the 1996 anniversary of the bloody June 4 crackdown, demanding the release of those jailed for their involvement in the movement.
Fu and Chen Ping's sentences come amid a widening crackdown on dissent by Beijing. Most dissidents are already serving lengthy sentences in prisons or labour camps or have been forced into exile.
China drew international condemnation when a Beijing court sentenced former student leader Wang Dan to 11 years in prison in October for conspiring to subvert the government.
Beijing dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.
A Chinese court last week sentenced dissident Zhang Zong'ai to five years in prison for counter-revolutionary incitement.
Three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui.
In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that borders Hong Kong, two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government.

43,"China said on Friday that sexual contact was the leading cause of AIDS and warned that venereal disease could be a springboard for an AIDS epidemic.
""China should take immediate steps to curb the epidemic of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) because their incidence rate is rising in the country,"" the official Xinhua news agency quoted health experts as saying.
""Sexual contact is now the leading cause of HIV infection,"" the agency said. AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, is caused by infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
The number of reported cases of eight major sexually transmitted diseases diseases, including AIDS, gonorrhea and syphilis, had risen to 362,000 last year and officials forecast that figure could rocket to more than 800,000 by 2000, it said.
""We should give first priority to STD control in the battle against AIDS, because STDs are a springboard for an HIV/AIDS epidemic,"" Xinhua quoted Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang as telling a national conference on the disease in Beijing.
""In line with the increase of STDs, the occurrence of HIV infection will be more frequent,"" Xinhua quoted Ye Shunzhang, director of the National Venereal Disease Control Centre, as telling the conference, which closed on Thursday.
Official figures show China has 4,305 people infected with HIV, up from 3,341 at the end of 1995, but experts say up to 100,000 could be infected.
""China could see its number of HIV cases spinning out of control if prompt, preventive measures are not taken,"" Xinhua said.
China would open hundreds of screening stations as part of a plan to set up a national AIDS monitoring network to supply accurate and fast data on the spread of the disease, it said.
Health authorities would open between 300 and 400 HIV monitoring centres by 2000 and set up a national laboratory to lead the country's battle against the disease.
Prostitution and narcotics abuse have both boomed in recent years as freewheeling economic reforms weaken puritan Marxist values.

43,"China's Communist Party has taken its crusade to resurrect socialist values to Tibet, with a call for textbooks and publications to stress the historical links between the restive Himalayan region and its Chinese rulers.
Delegates to a recent Communist Party meeting urged Tibet to embrace ""spiritual civilisation"", or socialist values, to uproot the influence of the region's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, the Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Saturday.
""Protecting the unity of the motherland and opposing the Dalai Lama's evil activities to split the motherland is a major task of building spiritual civilisation in our region,"" the November 6 edition of the official newspaper said.
""School textbooks, classrooms and various publications must strengthen (the) embodiment of the historical links between Tibet and the motherland,"" the newspaper said.
Beijing says Tibet has been a part of China for centuries but many Tibetans dispute this and have yearned for independence since Communist troops marched into the region in 1950.
""The mentality that Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland must be firmly established throughout society,"" the Tibet Daily said.
The newspaper accused the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his peaceful campaign for Tibetan autonomy, of disfiguring religion to paralyse his people and split the deeply-Buddhist region from the rest of China.
Tibet's most revered spiritual leader fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed revolt against Chinese rule.
""Tibetan Buddhism has already been disfigured beyond recognition by the Dalai clique,"" the Tibet Daily said.
""The Dalai clique has employed every possible trick to use religion in vain attempts to split the motherland and paralyse the people,"" it said.
Greater efforts were needed to expose the ""evil"" acts of the Dalai Lama that were aimed at stirring up turmoil, it said.
Tibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by the Dalai Lama's supporters.
The newspaper warned that Tibetan culture and material life had been flooded by religious ideas and urged people to embrace socialist culture.
""Religion...cannot provide the impetus for development in Tibet and cannot provide any help to the Tibetan people in throwing off poverty and becoming prosperous,"" it said.
China has called for greater efforts to promote atheism in the deeply religious area, saying that religious beliefs are a hindrance to economic progress.
Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.
China slammed as rude intereference in its internal affairs a meeting last month between the globe-trotting Buddhist monk and representatives of the European Parliament.
Beijing also threatened trade relatiation against Canberra after a meeting between the Dalai Lama and Australian Prime Minister John Howard in September.
"
43,"China has launched its first survey of its hundreds of millions of rural residents to gauge the impact of nearly two decades of economic reforms on the country's agricultural sector, officials said on Monday.
Since January 1, an army of six million officials and interviewers has been mobilised to canvass an estimated 230 million households in towns and villages throughout China's countryside, Shao Jianmin, deputy leader of the Beijing Rural Survey Team, said in an interview.
The survey is intended to gather more detailed data on rural areas, which have been radically transformed by the sweeping market-oriented agricultural and economic reforms launched by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, he said.
In Nankou township to the north of Beijing, a band of women interviewers visited the homes of local residents on Monday to ask about the size of their families, educational levels, what crops they grew and the occupations of family members.
Deng's reforms have encouraged private enterprise and rural industry, creating huge changes in the countryside, officials said.
""We don't know how people in the agricultural sector are making money,"" said interviewer Xie Fang.
Official statistics show 75 percent of China's 1.2 billion people are farmers but officials say this figure is misleading because it includes many former farmers who have since become migrant labourers or rural factory hands.
China's farmers have increasingly abandoned their ploughs to take up more lucrative jobs in small-scale township industries or to seek their fortunes in cities.
""After this survey the country will have an overall understanding of how many households are engaged in farming, how many are in township enterprises and how many have gone into business for themselves,"" Xie said.
""This is the first national rural census to be held since Liberation (the 1949 communist takeover),"" Shao said.
""We will be going to every single household,"" he said.
The survey would take about one month to complete, he said, adding that the findings would be published at the end of this year and throughout next year.
The survey would cover the numbers and types of farming and non-farming rural firms as well as details of land use.
It would also gather data on infrastructure in villages, towns and counties, Shao said.
""The census will better serve national macro-economic policy and provide more accurate statistics for rural management,"" he said.
China must feed one-fifth of the world's people on just seven percent of its arable land but Beijing says a lack of accurate data about cropland has hindered efforts to stop the misuse and erosion of land and boost grain production.
The survey may clear up confusion over how much arable land China has. Last December, officials said the amount had been miscalculated, and they raised the estimated total to 147 million hectares (363 million acres) compared with 133.4 million (328 million acres) just six months earlier.
China has forecast a record grain output of 480 million tonnes last year, up from 1995's 466 million tonnes, a record at the time.
Survey authorities have launched a propaganda blitz to urge farmers to cooperate for the good of the nation, Shao said.
""They started broadcasts about it in December 1996,"" said Shen Jiucai, a 59-year-old gatekeeper and part-time farmer in Nankou. ""This will be of great use and spur on agricultural development.""
"
43,"China on Thursday warned the United States to stop selling arms to Taiwan, saying the issue could ruin relations despite the friendly smiles shown on Defence Minister Chi Haotian's current U.S. visit.
Washington's arms sales to Beijing's island rival would destroy the warming Sino-U.S. relationship that was vital for maintaining regional and world peace, the official China Daily said in a commentary.
""To continue to sell weapons to Taiwan will upset Washington's apple cart and eventually ruin Sino-U.S. relations,"" the commentary said.
Although Chi Haotian's long-delayed visit to the United States could help renew bilateral ties, Washington's policy towards Taiwan would continue to be a sore point in relations between the two Pacific giants, the commentary said.
""A friendly smile cannot ignore or wipe away the underlying embarrassment that exists bewteen the two countries,"" it said.
""The ties can be broken if the U.S. continues to sell advanced weapons and military equipment to Taiwan.""
Chi is on a two-week fence-mending visit that was postponed twice by wrangling over Taiwan.
Taiwan's procurement of U.S. weapons would only undermine peaceful reunification with mainland China by fanning sentiment for independence on the island, the commentary said.
""The sale of weapons to Taiwan will whip up whatever dreams of independence some people are harbouring on the island,"" it said, adding that Beijing would seek reunification at any cost.
""The Chinese government will not stand idly by and ignore any challenge to that goal,"" the commentary said, echoing a blunt speech Chi delivered to U.S. military officers on Tuesday.
Chi held talks with President Bill Clinton and Defence Secretary William Perry on Monday, pointedly refusing to renounce Beijing's right to retake Taiwan by force if necessary.
Beijing and Taipei split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the Nationalist army fled into exile on the island off the mainland's southeastern coast.
Sino-U.S. relations were strained in March when Washington sent two aircraft carriers to waters near Taiwan in the wake of missile tests and military exercises held by Beijing to intimidate the island in the run-up to its first direct presidential elections.
Washington recognises communist Beijing as the sole legal representative of all China but maintains the right to arm and even defend the island that Beijing regards as a renegade province.
Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said on Wednesday he was not worried that the thaw in U.S.-China military ties would harm the island's ability to procure advanced weapons from the United States.
Two days before Chi arrived in the United States, the U.S. Army announced it had awarded a $63 million contract to a Boeing Co unit to produce 74 high-tech Avenger anti-aircraft missile systems for Taiwan.
Taiwan has also been allowed to buy Patriot anti-missile missile batteries from U.S. defence giant Raytheon Co.
The Avengers and Patriots are to enter service by 1999, boosting the island's defences against China's People's Liberation Army.
"
43,"China's defence sector and state-owned heavy industries are the country's biggest loss-makers but reform of the lumbering state sector is proceeding at a snail's pace, analysts said on Friday.
More than 45 percent of China's 68,800 state industrial firms posted losses from January to September, a rise of 17.6 percent from the same period last year, according to the latest data from the State Statistical Bureau.
""Those most in need of help would be the military industries and traditional industries,"" said Zheng Haihang, a professor of industrial economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Traditional industries included the coal and oil sectors as well as heavy industry, Zheng said by telephone.
""To put it simply, it's mostly these traditional industries, which have a very backward structure,"" Zheng said of the state sector's mounting losses.
Many of China's state-run enterprises are overstaffed and unable to compete in domestic or overseas markets. They also carry the heavy burden of providing cradle-to-grave welfare services for their employees.
The combined losses of state firms reached 65.12 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) during the first nine months of the year, a rise of 45.7 percent from a year ago, official figures show.
Compounding the problem is interest on unpaid debts -- a substantial burden even after two interest rate cuts this year.
""The debt burden of state-owned enterprises is very heavy, so of course this affects their profitability,"" Zheng said.
The January-September net profits of China's state industries fell to 11.28 billion yuan, down 75.8 percent from the same period last year, the statistics show.
Reform of defence industries -- many based in remote and backward inland regions and fitted with ageing technology -- had proceeded slowly, the economist said.
""Military industries are trying to transform into civilian industries, but the transition is extremely difficult -- there's no capital,"" he said.
Officials have said more than 200 state firms have been declared insolvent to date but Beijing has been wary of pushing ahead with bankruptcies.
Beijing fears that reform of state enterprises will lead to mass unemployment and eventually spark social unrest, said one Western analyst reached by telephone.
""That's one major reason why reform is going so slowly,"" said the analyst, who declined to be identified.
China's trade unions had set up a special fund this year to help workers in ailing state firms, the China Daily newspaper said on Friday.
""The relief fund...is designed to help employees from money-losing state-owned enterprises maintain decent living standards,"" the newspaper said.
Unions had raised 1.2 billion yuan so far this year to help about seven million impoverished workers in state enterprises and disaster-stricken areas, it said.

43,"A U.S. defence team found human remains and parts of an American bomber on Tuesday after making its way up a steep mountain slope in southwestern China to inspect a recently found World War Two crash site.
The officials clawed their way up the slippery, granite face of Maoer mountain in Guangxi province and pronounced the mission a success despite the injury in a fall of a U.S. reporter accompanying them.
""We consider this a very successful mission,"" said Alan Liotta, deputy director of the MIA/POW (Missing in Action/Prisoner of War) office under the Department of Defence.
Speaking to reporters in the town of Xingan after returning from the site late on Tuesday, he said findings confirmed information about the fatal crash that occurred on August 31, 1944.
The B-24 bomber with its 10-man crew never returned from a raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan.
""Any step that we can take to bring a case closer to resolution and to provide a family some answers ...indeed gives us some satisfaction,"" Liotta told reporters.
The six-man forensic team from the Department of Defence flew into the Guangxi region on Monday to try to recover remains and learn more about the crash.
Local residents, searching for wild herbs in the region's thick forest, discovered the crash site last October.
U.S. officials first learned of the find when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian gave U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry two dogtags recovered from the site during a meeting in Washington last month.
Chinese authorities will turn over some of the remains later on Wednesday and a formal ceremony is to be held in Beijing on Friday.
The human remains would be taken back to the United States for identification, Liotta said.
The U.S. team's elation at reaching what was left of the bomber was dulled by an injury to Voice of America journalist Stephanie Ho who was knocked unconscious briefly after she slipped 75 metres (yards) down a slope returning from the site.
Ho lost her footing as she made her way across the moss-covered face of the mountain. A doctor at the scene said her injury was not serious but she was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city of Guilin.
""This was extremely treacherous terrain and a very difficult climb,"" said Liotta.
Journalists who made the trek to the site saw a pile of charred and twisted metal wedged into a narrow crevass on the mountain side. Higher up the slope was a chunk of the plane's fuselage along with part of an engine, also wedged into rock.
""We had a total destruction of the aircraft,"" Liotta said.
Two farmers hunting for wild herbs found the crash site and alerted officials. They will receive 50,000 yuan ($6,000) each as a reward from the state, local authorities said.
U.S. officials said they had made contact with all 10 families of the crewmen aboard the plane.
They also said the site appeared to have been untouched for more than half a century.
""It's no wonder it took 50 years to discover the site,"" said David Rankin, a forensic anthropologist with the Defence Department's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.
""We are truly talking about an extremely remote, isolated area.""

43,"China's inefficient coal sector needs foreign funds and technology to modernise but must do more to create a better investment environment, industry officials and foreign businessmen said on Tuesday.
""There are opportunities for literally billions of dollars in coal investments here,"" said David Klingner, group executive of Australian mining group CRA Ltd.
Development of the sector's small and inefficient mines and antiquated power plants would be vital for China to meet ambitious production goals and sustain economic growth in the next century, Klingner told an energy conference in Beijing.
""The government is coming to realise that a way to ensure that the energy resources for future development are available is by getting foreign companies in with their expertise and capital capacity,"" Klingner said.
China relies on coal to meet about 75 percent of its energy needs and production accounted for about one-third of world output, Klingner said.
However, Beijing needed to create a sound investment environment to woo foreign cash and technology to the backward sector, said Rong Geng, director of the coal and oil department of China's State Development Bank.
""The coal industry... is characterised by long periods of construction, huge demands for funds, long repayment periods, low profits and certain risks,"" Rong said.
About 10 percent of funding for large and medium-scale coal projects came from overseas, Rong said, adding that his bank would try to raise more foreign capital for coal projects in China.
""We need to foster a sound investment environment for foreign investors so as to enhance their confidence,"" Rong told the conference.
Klingner said Beijing had made large strides in opening its doors to the once-sensitive power sector but foreign firms would require stronger legal guarantees before taking the plunge into the Chinese market.
""Foreign companies see the regulatory framework for mining investments, especially insofar as it relates to resources title, as critical to the success of any long-term commercial venture,"" he said.
Better risk assessment, long-term contracts and assurances of continued profits are also vital to entice foreign firms to China's coal sector, he said.
""The international financial community will want these issues settled prior to the funding of large-scale mining projects,"" he said.
China, with more than 80,000 small-scale mines, needed to form large-scale production to improve efficiency and cut down on waste and pollution, he said, adding that streamlining was now being balanced against the politically-charged concerns of mass unemployment.
Large-scale mining could also greatly reduce China's high rate of mining deaths and accidents, he said. About 10,000 workers are killed in China's mines every year.
China has said it would open at least 300 coal projects to foreign investors with priority to foreign investment in pit-head power plants, coal transport facilities and coal-bed methane. It has not said whether investors would be allowed to export output.

1,"Sweden beat the Czech Republic 3-0 in a World Cup ice hockey game on Thursday, setting up a showdown for European group supremacy against Finland and leaving the reigning world champions searching for answers.
The fast-skating Swedes seized control of the game from the opening faceoff, forcing the Czechs to take several early penalties and keeping its vaunted offense in check.
Toronto Maple Leaf winger Mats Sundin opened the scoring midway through the first period when he sped around the Czech defense and pulled Dallas Stars' goalie Roman Turek across the crease before sliding the puck between the netminder's legs.
The Swedish National Hockey League (NHL) connection struck again early in the second frame when Washington Capital defenseman Calle Johansson blasted a slapshot from the blue line past a screened Turek with only 57 seconds gone.
Turek, voted best goalie at the world championships for the past two years, was once again screened when a weak shot from Jonas Bergqvist found the bottom corner of the net to close out the scoring for the undefeated Swedes.
The Czechs came into the tournament riding high after capturing the world title in Vienna in May, but have lost the first two games of the tournament and are in danger of crashing out despite having their version of the ""Dream Team"".
With the addition of Pittsburgh Penguins duo Jaromir Jagr and Petr Nedved, Montreal Canadiens sharpshooter Martin Rucinsky and the core of the world championship team in tact, the Czechs were looking to prove they belonged at the pinnacle of the hockey world.
The match at Prague's Sports Hall was to be a homecoming of sorts for the Czechs, their first home game since beating Canada 3-2 in a thrilling world championship final on a last minute goal.
But after a demoralising loss to Finland in its tournament opener on Tuesday, and another listless effort on Thursday, Czech fans had had enough, pelting the Czech bench with beer cans near the end of the game.
Even Czech coach Ludek Bukac, a veteran coach with almost 30 years behind the bench, was left searching for an answer to his sputtering offense and the team's lack of dynamism.
""The Swedes played well, you've got to hand it to them. But the fact that we didn't score at home is not a very good showing,"" he said.
Added Jagr: ""We aren't that bad, but our performance is not showing it.""
Bukac, who has often expressed his disdain for bringing in players who have talent but not team spirit refused to comment on whether he would invite the same team back if he could do it all again.
But with nine players on the roster with seven or less of national team games under their belts, the Czech players know they must come together quickly, or face the embarassment of failing to win in what is touted as the true battle for hockey supremacy.
""We've got to concentrate on winning against Germany and moving on to the next round, nothing else,"" added Robert Reichel, who recently re-signed with the Calgary Flames after playing one year in Germany.
The win allows Sweden to keep pace with group leaders Finland, who have also won both their games so far but have a better goal difference.
The two teams meet on Sunday in Stockholm while the Czechs must regroup and beat winless Germany in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday to move into the quarterfinals next week in North America.

1,"Senate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences.
Analysts said last weekend's first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further boost should be seen.
""Provided that nothing drastic happens, it's pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event,"" Jay King, of Wood and Company, told Reuters.
In the first round of voting last weekend, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority.
The opposition Social Democrats were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists but only 35 percent of the electorate voted.
Of the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties.
Analysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country's economic, or political course.
""Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats. I don't think there should be any surprises,"" said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague.
Following last weekend's vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.
But dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors.
The crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint.
Some analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.
""There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,"" said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. ""There's no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.""
Citibank's Maly added: ""I wouldn't foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market.""

1,"It may be only the second qualifier on the long road leading to the 1998 World Cup but the Czech Republic and Spain are approaching Wednesday night's European group six match as though it were a battle for the final.
For the Czechs it will be the first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Spain are expected to give Real Madrid's teenage striker Raul Gonzalez his first cap in the hope that he will give them badly-needed scoring power.
Both sides opened their campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0.
But Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither the Czechs nor Spain can afford to give ground in Prague.
""(The Spanish) are explosive and technically very sound. This game's made all the more important because a loss will make it a difficult trip for either side,"" Czech midfielder Karel Poborsky of English premier league Manchester United said.
Victory alone will satisfy Spain's veteran goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. ""I would not be happy with a draw, we want three points,"" he said.
Czech coach Dusan Uhrin has named 16 of the 19-strong squad which caused a surprise by reaching the final of June's European championship in which they lost to Germany.
They include in-form midfielder Patrik Berger, who scored six goals in 10 days for English premier league Liverpool last month.
""Spain is obviously a strong team but we showed in London that we can play anybody,"" Berger said.
While the Czechs are looking to build on recent success, Spain are rebuilding and plugging holes where necessary.
Raul, 19, who scored twice against the Czechs in the quarter-finals of last season's European under-21 competition, is Real Madrid's top scorer even after being moved into a supporting role by new coach Fabio Capello.
""There are some players absent...It's the right moment to pick Raul,"" Spain manager Javier Clemente said.
Clemente had been strongly criticised for sticking by veteran forward Julio Salinas instead of choosing Raul.
Neither Salinas nor injured striker Kiko Narvaez are on the trip but Kiko's Atletico Madrid team mate Jose Luis Caminero is fit and is expected to be given the role of playmaker in the starting line-up.
With Spain likely to face problems in the air, tall defender Roberto Rios and striker Ismael Urzaiz have been called into the squad for the first time.
Of the seven players chosen from the multi-billion peseta Barcelona line-up, midfielder Guillermo Amor, defender Abelardo Fernandez and striker Juan Pizzi have not played regularly this season under new coach Bobby Robson, a former England manager.
By contrast utility man Luis Enrique Martinez has blossomed since moving to Barcelona from Real Madrid.

1,"Czech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line.
Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns ($7 million) from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion.
The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though ""the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage"".
""Overall, Sepap year-end earnings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels,"" a company statement said.
The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns.
Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns.
""The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter. Anticipated price increases have not taken hold at the anticipated levels in all of the pulp and paper grades,"" the statement said.
It added that the group's second biggest subsidiary, newsprint maker ROTO, ""continued to produce good results in a market that is weakening"".
ROTO showed a nine-month pre-tax profit of 149 million crowns on sales of 1.25 billion crowns.
Last year, Sepap was the centre of a heated battle for control between Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman and Swedish forestry concern Assidoman.
Dingman, who controls 48 percent of Sepap through his Daventree Ltd investment company, won the battle, but later accepted Assidoman's role as a strategic partner in the paper industry. The Swedish firm holds a 39 percent stake in Sepap.

Exchanges in Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Bratislava and Bucharest all gained ground, while Zagreb and Sofia traded mixed. Ljubljana was the one gray cloud, posting slight losses.
The Central European Share Index (CESI) which reflects the price movements of 50 selected Czech, Polish and Hungarian shares, firmed 66.11 points.
PRAGUE
Czech share prices were mostly steady on the Prague Stock Exchange throughout the week, with little movement expected soon as the holiday season slowly winds up.
The PX50 index edged up 3.6 points from Monday to close at 568.6 on Thursday.
Leading trading were SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka, though SPT's movements were largely characterised as ""accounting procedures"" that saw the issue gain as much as 102 crowns one session, only to lose the same amount the following day.
""The final price (of SPT) was not the real market price, but because average prices are not used for the close, it gives an artificial final number,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. SPT closed on Thursday at 3,340 crowns.
Dealers have long-complained that some market participants consistently manipulate prices on the bourse, a fact that to cloud foreign investor perceptions of the Czech market.
WARSAW
Polish shares on Thursday rose for the sixth consecutive session but analysts said stronger selling after price-fixing showed the market was losing steam and made it unclear if the growth trend would continue.
""It seems we now have a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers,"" said Krzysztof Rogalski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski SA brokerage.
But some analysts said a real growth trend had already begun, sparked by firms releasing better July earnings at the start of the week. The WIG index closed at 13,597.4 points, up 892.7 points or 7.0 percent from last Friday's close.
Analysts said recent systematic gains in higher turnovers by several large-cap stocks was a good sign that could help return the market toward this year's July 5, 14,282.2-point high next week.
BUDAPEST
Prices rose at both of this week's sessions as market participants returned after holidays on Monday and Tuesday.
The rest of the market strengthened as investors were cheered because the U.S. Federal Reserve had left interest rates steady.
""It's certainly due to the fact the U.S. investors put money into the east European emerging markets,"" Peter Haas of Postabank Securities said. ""Optimism seems to have spread over investors after the danger of a rate hike was eliminated.""

1,"Markets across Eastern Europe remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts seeing little on the horizon to break the bearish trend.
Stock exchanges in Bratislava, Bucharest, and Zagreb all lost ground on the week, while Prague and Warsaw held steady. Budapest and Ljubljana bucked the trend, rising slightly, although it appeared neither would see a sustained upturn in the near future.
PRAGUE
Not even a strong showing by the centre-right governing coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the Prague Stock Exchange out of its current malaise, as the PX50 index inched up 0.3 points on the week to close at 510.4.
Analysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little power, investors remain put off by poor market regulation.
""I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring changes to the market,"" said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.
""I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic.""
Investors have long complained that market regulation and legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little protection for minority shareholders.
WARSAW
The Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week and analysts said it could extend its three-and-a-half-week horizontal trend next week as no fresh signals were in sight.
""We are still in a horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create a clear direction for the market,"" said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.
But other analysts saw the generally positive economic climate as an impulse strong enough to help the bourse climb next week above 14,000 points.
Analysts said the central bank deputy head's Tuesday comment on a possible rise in interest rates next year was bringing some uncertainty to the bourse but was unlikely to signficantly hurt prices.
BUDAPEST
Hungarian shares started off the weekend strongly, boosted by a government decision to hike energy prices, but they ran out of steam by the middle of the week.

The unofficial VAB index inched down from the previous session by 1.1 percent to 294.2 points, while the BIG index eased 1.07 percent to 293.41.
Fertiliser maker Azomures SA dominated trading, while newcomer, an oilfield equipment maker, put on a poor show.
ZAGREB
Croatian stocks were mostly lower in dwindling trade and analysts said they could see no end to the bearish period as big buyers continue to shy away from the market because of political developments.
Croatia has been shaken by a wave of strikes, and last week Zagreb saw its biggest protest in years.

Political concerns were also apparent in Ljubljana this week, with investors waiting for a new prime minister to be named, probably in the second half of December.
""The market will be uneasy until it is clear who will form the new government,"" one trader said.
Still, the SBI index rallied on Friday to close at 1,160.1, up 0.7 percent on the week.
Although the Liberal Democrats of current Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek were the strongest single party in the general election, winning 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats, they are facing a loose alliance of rightist ""Spring"" parties, who got 45 seats.

1,"Britain's Tim Henman emerged on Friday as the only seed to advance to the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open.
In the day's opening match, seventh seeded Henman downed second seed Wayne Ferreira 6-4 6-3, while fifth seed Todd Martin was edged out by Germany's David Prinosil 7-6 7-6 and sixth seed Michael Stich lost to Czech Martin Damm 5-7 6-4 6-4.
Czech Petr Korda rounded out the final four with his win over Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak 6-1 6-0. Korda now faces another Davis Cupper in Damm. Henman will square off against Prinosil in the other semifinal on Saturday.
Reigning Ostrava champion Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, never looked comfortable against Henman, the more aggressive of the two for most of the match.
He failed to gain a single break point all match while the 22-year-old Briton broke serve late in both sets.
Henman's win avenged his loss to the South African in Toronto earlier this year, and he said he had taken notes from that match on to court on Friday.
""In Toronto, Ferreira was dictating the points -- serving very well and hitting forehands very well -- so today I tried to be very aggressive and, when I had an opportunity, move forward,"" said Henman, ranked 26th in the world.
Local favourite Damm, a finalist at the Beijing Open last week showed little signs of jet lag in spoiling Stich's 28th birthday. After losing the first set, Damm scored crucial breaks in the ninth game of the final two sets to take the match.
For Martin, defeat was especially painful as he could have gained valuable ground on Ferreira in the race for the final spot at the ATP Tour championship in Hanover at the end of the season.
The American currently sits 199 points behind the South African. A semifinal berth would have eaten 37 points out of that lead while a place in the finals would have almost halved Ferreira's advantage.
Prinosil, ranked 58th in the world, profited from a Martin double fault at 5-5 in the first set tiebreak and took a 4-0 lead in the second set tiebreak on the way to sealing victory.
Martin said: ""I realise I didn't help my cause at all but we've got two of the biggest tournaments coming up and I think whoever does really well in those events should probably play themselves into a position at Hanover.
Martin, Stich and Ferreira both play next week in Stuttgart, where the winner gains 370 tour points, 200 more than the winner here.
The tournament's organisers said on Friday that they expect Becker will also be fit to play. In a move to accomodate the Australian Open champion, his first round match has been put back until Wednesday.

1,"Germany's David Prinosil, in a homecoming of sorts, overwhelmed Czech Petr Korda 6-1 6-2 in the final of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Sunday.
The 23-year-old German, who was born near here in Olomouc and emigrated to Germany when he was 14, took control of the match from the beginning, keeping Korda off balance with his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes.
As was the case all week, Prinosil used his deft return of service as an offensive weapon, seizing on both break points he had to take the first set in just 22 minutes.
It was more of the same in the second set, with world number 49 Korda taking more chances, but failing to unsettle the German, who was playing in only his second final on the tour after he won in Newport last year.
Korda was on the verge of breaking Prinosil in the fourth game, but the world number 58 blasted four straight service winners to take the game, and then ripped two crosscourt forehands to break in the fifth and seventh games in a match that lasted just 50 minutes.  
""If someone told me I wouldn't lose a set all week, I would have said they were crazy. I don't think I have ever played this well,"" said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000.
Korda said: ""I was a little drained from yesterday's match and he hit the ball well. The points were short, which gave me little chance to take control of the match.""
Korda needed two hours late on Saturday to defeat Davis Cup team mate Martin Damm in three sets while Prinosil beat Henman in just 56 minutes.

1,"The three-party coalition of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus won a majority of seats on Saturday in run-off elections to parliament's new upper house, the Senate.
But the premier's own party won fewer seats than expected after dominating the first round last week and voter turnout was dismal despite an appeal for Czechs to cast their ballots from President Vaclav Havel.
With all 81 constituencies declared, the coalition parties secured 52 seats in the Senate, the very existence of which many Czechs have questioned.
The result marked a turnaround for the coalition, central Europe's last centre-right government, which lost its majority in the more powerful lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, six months ago.
Klaus's own Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won 32 seats ahead of the strongest opposition party, the Social Democrats, with 25.
The Christian Democrats, a junior coalition partner, took take 13 seats while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance, won seven.
The little-reformed Communists clinched two seats and two went to independents.
""I welcome the fact that the governing coalition took two-thirds of the senatorial seats, and that's a huge victory over the opposition,"" said Klaus, who sits in the lower house along with all other government ministers.
""The result in the second round isn't any surprising victory, but on the other hand the real fact that ODS has about 40 percent of the senators I would have to mark as successful.""
The Central Election Commission reported that second round turnout was around 30 percent, lower even than the 35 percent registered in the first round held on November 15-16.
The centre-left Social Democrats, whose strong gains in June lower house elections stripped the coalition's majority, were saved the embarassment of a Senate dominated solely by their arch-rivals from Klaus's party.
""I am pleased that Senate will be a place of democratic discussion, and never the place of arrogant domination of one or another political party,"" Milos Zeman, the chairman of the Social Democrats and the lower house, told reporters.
Zeman's party has been beset by internal bickering since June, but the results of the run-offs -- between the top two first-round candidates in constituencies where nobody won more than half the vote -- could have been worse for the opposition.
""Most importantly the Senate won't be one-coloured or two-coloured as was expected, but multi-coloured,"" said analyst Jiri Pehe of Prague's Open Media Research Institute.
Before the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house but opinion surveys showed many had no interest.
The Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus's coalition. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance.
Klaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the Communists to turn back the clock on reform, and his supporters were galvanised by the coalition's June setback.

1,"It's a Snip, bidding to become the ninth horse to win two years in succession in the 106-year history of the Pardubice steeplechase, leads a British raid to this city east of Prague on Sunday.
Last year's winner, one of a trio of British horses expected for the controversial four-and-a-quarter mile event (6.9 km), has the considerable advantage from the saddle of Richard Dunwoody, one of the world's most accomplished jump jockeys.
The Pardubice, a unique test of man and horse, includes a series of demanding obstacles and has been compared to the Grand National at Aintree, a race Dunwoody has won twice.
Race organisers have made the course easier in recent years, including modifying the daunting Taxis jump with its tough, high, wide fence and deep ditch. 
This and various other changes among the other 30 jumps followed massive protests and the embarassing 1993 outcome when only one horse managed to finish.
A total of 21 horses have died in the Pardubice over the years.
Rounding out the trio of British challengers looking to win part of the 2.5 million crown ($92,000) purse are Irish Stamp and Veleda II.
Irish Stamp, to be ridden by Norman Williamson, has a clear chance and is rated considerably higher in England than It's a Snip, although the latter's proven ability over the course will be a major factor.
Of the others, Polish-trained Scater is also expected to make a bold show.
Despite its long history, the Pardubice has only recently regained its former status.
""In the past everyone in Britain knew of the enormously difficult course but they didn't have much interest,"" said Nigel Miller, one of the organisers who has worked to bring the British contingent here.
""But this year, one of the biggest hits of the season is to come here for a two-day trip to one of the most historic races around.""
"
36,"Monsanto Co. said Thursday it is considering several options for the future, including splitting into two separate, publicly traded corporations -- one a life sciences company and one a chemical business.
Other options being weighed by the St. Louis-based company are to sell or merge its chemical businesses with other firms or to keep the chemical operations and restructure them.
""In recent years, the strategies and needs of the chemical and life sciences businesses have become quite different,"" Chairman Robert Shapiro said in a statement.
Wall Street applauded the possible sale or spin-off of the chemical business, which had been expected, sending Monsanto's stock to a new 52-week high of $42.75 early in the day. The shares later traded at $42, up $1.375.
Analysts said Monsanto's life science businesses -- including agricultural chemicals, biotechnology, food additives and pharmaceuticals -- likely would have a higher valuation as a separate company than if Monsanto remained intact.
""The key here is that the chemical business does not have the growth potential as the ag-biotech and the ag-chemical and the drug component could,"" NatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said.
Monsanto Chief Economist Nicholas Filippello said in a telephone interview that no options for the chemical operations had been ruled out.
He added that a decision was expected to be made as soon as possible, but did not give a timeframe. ""As soon as practical,"" he said.
Monsanto had been expected to shed its chemical businesses, which are affected by economic cycles and the price of commodity raw materials, since the sale late last year of its worldwide styrenics plastics business.
In recent months, it has been the strength of Monsanto's agricultural business that has propelled the stock upward.
Spinning off the chemical businesses as a separate company was the option that most analysts favoured, since it would not have the tax implication of an outright sale.
""I would say the chances of keeping it (chemicals) and restructuring it are pretty slim,"" Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg said.
The chemical businesses that may be sold or spun off include nylon and acrylic fibers, Saflex plastic interlayer, which is sold to glass manufacturers, and speciality chemicals.
""The chemical operations ... would be very viable as a standalone company,"" said NatWest analyst Andrew Cash.
Cash said Monsanto's acrylic fiber, nylon and Saflex businesses have limited competition in the United States and very favourable cost structures.
""It would be a focused company with good technology ... and a lot of interest in the assets from a stock market perspective, if they choose to spin it off,"" Cash said.
However, agricultural chemicals would remain as one of the crown jewels of the life sciences division.
Monsanto's popular Roundup weed killer is key to Monsanto's agricultural biotechnology business. The company has developed crops that are genetically altered to resist Roundup.
The life science operations also would include food additives and Monsanto's G.D. Searle pharmaceutical division. In a recent report, NatWest said it expected Monsanto to keep Searle, which some analysts previously thought would be sold.
In 1995 Monsanto's chemical sales of $3.69 billion accounted for about 40 percent of the company's total sales of $8.96 billion. The chemical businesses' operating profit of $357 million was 30 percent of the total profit of $1.17 billion.
In contrast, agricultural profit of $523 million accounted for nearly 45 percent of the total.
"
36,"At Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s annual meeting last year, Chairman Dwayne Andreas declined to give shareholders the floor, saying, ""This meeting runs according to my rules.""
This year, however, shareholders are pressing for different rules.
Four institutional shareholders will have the floor at Thursday's meeting here to present proposals dealing with corporate governance -- or how the board of directors oversees corporate management at ADM, which on Tuesday pleaded guilty to two counts of price fixing and agreed to pay $100 million in fines, by far the highest penalty ever for violating antitrust laws in the United States.
In its guilty plea, the company admitted it fixed prices for lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, widely used in foods, beverages and other products.
The shareholder vote at this year's meeting is expected to be close for one proposal that calls for ADM's board to be composed of a majority of independent directors with no personal or business connections with the company.
A survey of early votes showed that about 47 percent were in favour of the measure, the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) said on Wednesday. Calpers, the nation's largest public retirement system, known for its shareholder activism, co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.
""This proposal is prompted by our belief that the employment, business and family relationships of any corporate director has the potential to raise conflicts of interest that may limit the vigilance and diligence of the board,"" the co-sponsors said in a supporting statement contained in ADM's proxy materials for the meeting.
The independence of ADM's board has been an issue since it was disclosed in late June 1995 that the company was the target of a federal price-fixing investigation. Despite the settlement with the Justice Department, some major shareholders continue to voice concern about the board's ability to oversee ADM's management.
Of particular concern to some is that the department continues to investigate two top ADM executives -- Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, the son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, group vice president in charge of corn refining. Lysine, citric acid and other ADM products are refined from corn.
""There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at both the board and the management level,"" said Edward Durkin, director of special programmes at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters union, which is sponsoring a proposal this year to hold directors personally liable in cases of gross negligence.
In addition, the New York City Fire Department Pension Fund has proposed that confidential ballotting be allowed in shareholder votes, except in cases where there is a contested board election.
Since last year's meeting, ADM has agreed to cut its 17-member board down to 12 members. All current company executives have left the board, with the exception of Dwayne Andreas.
Some institutional shareholders have questioned the independence of ADM's nominees as outside directors. One nominee, Mollie Hale Carter, is the daughter of H.D. Hale, a former board member who retired from ADM this year. Other nominees include former Secretary of Agriculture John Block and former Ambassador Richard Burt.
At last year's meeting, which was punctuated with rounds of applause for ADM executives, the board defended its independence. Brian Mulroney, a board member and former prime minister of Canada, said at the time that ADM's independent directors ""are fully independent and have the utmost integrity.""
"
36,"Quaker Oats Co. is looking to shed its Snapple beverage business and, in the process, may also end up selling the Gatorade sports drink line, its single largest brand, analysts said Friday.
""I think it's up for sale,"" Prudential Securities analyst John McMillin said of Quaker's beverage division.
Speculation that Quaker may get rid of Snapple, which has posted operating losses since it was purchased for $1.8 billion two years ago, boosted Quaker's stock, which gained $1.50 to $37.50 in early afternoon trading on on the New York Stock Exchange.
""We've been saying since this summer that there was a high probability that Quaker would pursue a restructuring, and beyond just Snapple,"" CS First Boston analyst Michael Mauboussin said.
He said that a possible restructuring at Quaker likely would include selling some assets, which Mauboussin said were currently under-valued.
""Gatorade being the crown jewel, clearly,"" he added.
Rumors regarding an outright purchase of Quaker or various parts of its businesses have swirled around the Chicago-based company for about three years. Quaker has consistently declined to comment on any speculation.
""I will simply tell you that it is our policy not to comment on rumors and speculation,"" Quaker spokesman Ronald Bottrell said Friday.
The speculation gained credibility, analysts said, when the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Quaker might sell Gatorade and Snapple, with prices quoted between $3 billion and $4 billion.
""I would have said (the chance of Quaker selling its beverage business was) less than 50-50 before I read the article,"" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said. ""But I think if somebody offers them $4 billion ... they have to take it.""
The Wall Street Journal said the most likely buyers for Quaker's beverage business were said to be Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and PepsiCo Inc..
PepsiCo also declined to comment.
""We have a long standing policy of not commenting on rumors,"" said Richard Detwiler, director of public relations for PepsiCo.
If Quaker sold its beverage businesses, its food businesses, including oatmeal, ready-to-eat cereal and pasta and rice dishes, could also attract buyers, analysts said.
The Wall Street Journal said Philip Morris Cos. Inc. might be interested in buying some of Quaker's food brands to bolster its Kraft Foods operation.
A Kraft spokesman did not return a call seeking comment.
It had been widely anticipated that Quaker would scale back Snapple to a regional brand, spin it off or sell it.
Quaker management, however, said earlier this year that Snapple's fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business would remain a national brand.
""What he (Chairman William Smithburg) has been saying does not indicate that he is looking to sell the business right now,"" O'Neil of BT Securities said. ""But he always comments that he will act to increase shareholder value.""
Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz said selling off Quaker's businesses may yield the highest return to shareholders on a short-term basis. But ""it doesn't have to happen,"" Rabinowitz said.
Analysts have said previously that they expected Quaker to write off additional goodwill for Snapple, which would be a non-cash charge.
The company said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it will review Snapple for a possible charge to reduce its carrying value.

36,"Monsanto Co, which exceeded analysts' expectations for its third quarter, warned analysts not to increase earnings estimates for the full year, according to Nicholas Filippello, chief economist.
""I warned them (analysts) not to increase expectations for the full year,"" Filippello said, adding the First Call mean of analysts' estimates is $1.48 a share, compared with $1.25 a year ago.
""We're urging people not to increase the number,"" he added.  
Earlier, Monsanto reported third quarter earnings of $0.28 a share, up from $0.23 a year ago and above the First Call mean of $0.24.
Filippello said certain factors, including the timing of bulk aspartame sweetener shipments and an adjustment in the full-year tax rate, contributed to third quarter earnings exceeding First Call expectations.
Looking ahead, Filippello said Monsanto continues to weigh options for its chemical business, as reported earlier this month.  One possibility is to spin the chemicals operation off as a separate publicly traded company.  
Or chemicals could be spun off and then merged with another company, Filippello added. The ""spin-off/merger option,"" he said, would be preferrable from a tax standpoint from an outright sale of the chemical operations.
But he said it was too early to speculate which options was likely to take place.  ""I think it's too early to speculate,"" Filippello said.
If Monsanto shed its chemical operations, it would be left with a life sciences business consisting of agricultural products, pharmaceuticals and food ingredients.  
Filippello said Monsanto is considering ways to make food ingredients ""an important part of this life sciences company."" But it remains to be seen how much growth in food ingredients would be accomplished internally or if the company would undertake licensing, partnerships and possible acquisitions, he added.
The life sciences business would include the G.D. Searle pharmaceutical company, which analysts in the past had expected Monsanto to sell.
""There is no interest at this point in selling Searle,"" Filippello said. ""Searle clearly is an appreciating asset at this point...Our expectation at this time is that value is going to continue increase over time.""

36,"Shedding its chemical businesses would leave Monsanto Co as a pure play in the high-growth life sciences area with attractive agricultural biotechnology and pharmaceutical holdings.
""This entity is likely to (have) a higher valuation by itself than with the chemical businesses intact,"" NatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said Thursday.
""The key here is that the chemical business does not have the growth potential as the ag biotech and the ag chemical and the drug component could,"" he added.  
Earlier, Monsanto said it might spin off its chemical businesses, sell or merge them with other companies, or keep and restructure the operations.
The news sent the stock up 1-3/8 at 42 at mid-day, after setting a new 52-week high of 42-3/4.
""It has become increasingly clear, especially over the last couple of years, that the directions and the needs of the life sciences businesses and the chemical businesses were quite different,"" Nicholas Filippello, Monsanto chief economist, said in a telephone interview. ""We feel that we are doing this from a position of strength.""  
Analysts said the St. Louis-based company had been expected to shed its chemical businesses since the sale late last year of its worldwide stryrenics plastics business.
""I would say the chances of keeping it (chemicals) and restructuring it are pretty slim,"" said Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg.

36,"The green fields of agricultural biotechnology are turning into a legal battle ground as companies file suits and countersuits against each other to protect their stakes in the budding business.
Biotech players are ""suing each other over control of the technology,"" said Ray Goldberg, professor of Agriculture and Business at the Harvard Graduate School of Business. ""They are going to redefine how they work together.""
At stake are rights to produce and sell genetically enhanced crops. After more than a decade of research, biotech crops are beginning to be commercialized. They include corn and cotton that produce their own pesticides and soybeans that can withstand the use of certain herbicides.
In the end, analysts and company executives say, many of the lawsuits are expected to be settled out of court, resulting in agreements to license and swap technology.
""It is very unlikely, because stakes are very high, that the seed companies will really let this work its way entirely through the court system,"" said Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg.
""Ultimately (companies) will cross-license, trade rights and use these pieces of protected technology as assets and trade them back and forth,"" added Timothy Martin, a spokesman for Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.
Pioneer, which provides the leading share of seed for corn, the biggest U.S. crop, has been sued for alleged patent infringement by DeKalb Genetics Corp.
Pioneer's defence is that it has a U.S. patent pending, which if approved could supersede DeKalb's claims. Pioneer said the application for that patent was filed before DeKalb's.
The case illustrates how new and pending patents complicate the legal landscape for agricultural biotechnology as seed and biotech development companies seek protection for their gene portfolios, production methods and the biotech crops themselves.
""The patent positions are not yet clear. The patents that have been issued leave some room for different interpretations,"" said Michael Sund, vice president of communications and investor relations for Mycogen Corp.
Mycogen and Monsanto Co. have sued each other for alleged patent infringement, and Mycogen is considering appealing some recent rulings in Monsanto's favour, Sund said.
Despite the legal complications, companies are expected to continue full-steam to commercialize biotech crops.
""They've made the decision to go ahead,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst George Dahlman.
Mycogen, for example, this year commercialized in limited quantities three corn hybrids that contain the Bt gene, which enables the plant to produce a substance that is toxic to the European core borer, a major pest.
Sund said the hybrids have performed well, as expected, in fighting off the corn borer. ""Performance has been everything we hoped for,"" he added.
A genetically enhanced cotton that contains the Bt gene to fight bollworm has come under some tough scrutiny this year after a heavy infestation of the pest in some areas of Texas prompted farmers to use chemical sprays on the crop.
Monsanto, which collaborated with Delta and Pine Land Co. to produce Bollgard cotton, maintained that the biotech crop still performed well. Monsanto said Bollgard cotton had to be sprayed less than traditional cotton.
The collaboration between Monsanto and Delta and Pine Land is but one example of the partnerships that are being forged in agricultural biotechnology.
Monsanto has an ownership stake in DeKalb and Pioneer has a research collaboration with Mycogen.
These partnerships -- like the lawsuits -- underscore one key aspect of the biotechnology business: no one party has all the key pieces to the puzzle.
""No one single firm has the monopoly on the germ plasm,"" Goldberg said. ""No one single firm has the monopoly on the science.""

36,"Morton International Inc., the maker of Morton Salt, has gained a key European presence for two of its businesses due to planned acquisitions, its chairman said Thursday, and is likely to expand there with further purchases.
""We're prepared to look at specialty chemical investments anywhere in the world. There are more opportunities in Europe and Asia than in the U.S. right now,"" Morton Chairman S. Jay Stewart said in an interview.
Earlier this week, Morton said it plans to acquire Italian powder coatings company Pulverlac Spa and French salt company, Compagnie des Salins du Midi et des Salines de l'Est.
Morton International's major product is Morton Salt, known for the signature phrase, ""When it rains, it pours.""
""We had been looking for an opportunity to get a reasonably significant powder coatings base in Europe,"" Stewart said of the Pulverlac agreement.
Morton has other specialty chemicals operations overseas, including making packaging adhesives in Italy and the Netherlands.
Stewart said he saw good demand growth for powder coatings, which are now applied to metal parts for protection and coloration. That demand could expand greatly in the future if use of these coatings expands to plastics and wood, he added.
Morton said Pulverlac will join Morton's North American coatings business and the combined operations will have sales of more than $200 million.
Morton's total sales for fiscal 1996, ended June 30, were $3.3 billion, including $1.6 billion in specialty chemicals sales.
""The acquistion of Pulverlac is very much consistent with the company's focus on growing its specialty chemical operations,"" William Blair analyst Robert Bartels said.
Morton also established a European presence in its core salt business with a definitive agreement to acquire two-thirds of Salins du Midi for about $195 million. Morton said it will make a public cash tender offer in France for the remaining shares of Salins du Midi, bringing the total price to about $290 million.
Salins du Midi, with estimated 1996 sales of almost $270 million, will join Morton's salt group, resulting in combined sales of $870 million.
Salins du Midi, headquartered in Paris, supplies salt for food and agricultural products, water treatment, de-icing and industrial applications. Salins produces salt at nine sites in France and four in Spain.
Morton operates 22 salt facilities in the United States, Canada and the on the Island of Inagua in the Bahamas.
Stewart said the acquisitions are expected to close in the third or fourth quarters of fiscal 1997, which ends in June. The acquisitions are expected to add modestly to earnings in the first year of operation, which would be fiscal 1998, and then contribute more significantly a few years later.
Looking ahead, Stewart said specialty chemicals remains ""a priority"" for making acquisitions.
Morton is growing its salt and specialty chemicals businesses as it moves ahead with plans to merge its auto airbag business with Autoliv AB of Sweden. That merger is expected to be completed in calendar 1997.
Stewart said the current debate over potential safety hazards from airbags, which critics say may harm children and smaller adults, underscores what he saw as the value of the business combination.
The combined company would make not only airbags but also car passenger restraints, enabling it to capitalize on whatever safety systems are employed in the future, Stewart said.

36,"McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday it created a new position of chairman of its U.S. operations, in a move analysts said was sparked by intense competition and soft sales from existing stores in the domestic market.
McDonald's named Jack Greenberg, 54, to the new post of chairman, McDonald's U.S.A. He remains vice chairman of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company, but will relinquish the chief financial officer post.
Greenberg will continue to report to Michael Quinlan, McDonald's chairman.
""The signal they are trying to send is, 'we clearly recognise that we have problems in the U.S. and we are going to do something about it',"" NatWest Securities analyst Damon Brundage said of Greenberg's appointment.
Reflecting the mature and intensely competitive U.S. market, analysts said they expected McDonald's third-quarter same store sales will be down compared with a year ago. Same store data measure sales from units open at least a year.
""They have not had a single positive month in the U.S. this year,"" Brundage said of its same store sales. McDonald's does not disclose its same store sales.
""Margins have been under pressure for over a year in the U.S.,"" added Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels.
Greenberg's new post indicates that McDonald's was not pleased with the direction of its domestic business, Daniels said. ""They are trying to shake things up and put a little more focus on being aggressive in responding to the competition,"" he added.
The company has been introducing new offerings such as its Arch Deluxe hamburger earlier this year and the recent launch of Deluxe Grilled Chicken, Fish Filet and Crispy Chicken sandwiches.
McDonald's said Greenberg's appointment was aimed at strengthening U.S. management.
""While these changes are evolutionary, they will bring more management firepower where we need it, both for the short and long-term,"" Quinlan said in a statement.
As part of the management changes, Edward Rensi, McDonald's U.S.A president, will report to Greenberg. But Greenberg was quick to say he and Rensi have a good working relationship.
""Ed and I are good friends. We work well together. He's very enthusiastic about this,"" Greenberg said in a telephone interview. ""We all want this business to do well.""
Despite the pressure in the United States, McDonald's international business, which accounts for more than half of its operating income, continues to be strong, analysts said.
""International is a wide-open growth opportunity for McDonald's,"" Daniels said.
International profit growth is expected to contribute to an expected 12 percent gain in earnings for McDonald's overall in the third quarter, according to analyst estimates.
Given the intense competition between McDonald's, Wendy's International Inc. and Grand Metropolitan Plc.'s Burger King, Greenberg faces a tough job as head of the U.S. operations, analysts said.
""He is going to parachute into ... what looks to be one of the most challenging operating roles in the U.S. fast-food restaurant business,"" Brundage said.
Greenberg, 54, said he believed McDonald's was well positioned to compete in the domestic market.
""We've got more locations than anybody else. We've got the most powerful brand in the world... We've got the largest marketing budget. We've got enormous purchasing power,"" he added.
McDonald's operates more than 19,200 restaurants worldwide, including about 12,000 in the United States.
While Greenberg joined McDonald's in 1982 as chief financial officer, he said he has field experience with its restaurants. ""I spent a year in the field in restaurants and became a regional manager for a year as well,"" Greenberg said.
In other management moves, McDonald's also named Michael Conley, currently senior vice president and controller, as chief financial officer, succeeding Greenberg.

36,"Oneok Inc. and Western Resources Inc. on Thursday agreed to a $660 million deal that combines their natural gas assets and gives Western Resources access to a broader base of customers for its electricity and security services.
The deal reflects the moves within the utility industry to prepare for further deregulation.
Under the agreement, Oneok will take all the natural gas assets of Western Resources, making it the ninth largest gas distribution company in the United States serving 1.4 million customers. Tulsa-based Oneok is the parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co.
Western Resources, based in Topeka, Kan., will become the largest equity holder in Oneok, receiving about 3 million new shares of Oneok common stock and preferred stock that will be convertible, upon necessary regulatory approvals, into about another 19.3 million shares of Oneok common. Its total stake in Oneok is about 45 percent.
The deal is expected to close by mid-1997, following approval by Oneok shareholders and federal and state regulatory authorities.
""They (Oneok) are a total gas company. They understand the gas business better than we do,"" Western Resources president David Wittig said in a telephone interview.
By swapping its gas assets, Western Resources will be able to focus its efforts on growing its electricity and home-security businesses, both of which involve a customer base of home owners and 24-hour monitoring of consumers.
Oneok's 735,000 customers could become potential clients of Western Resources' services.
""Western Rseources has been becoming a nationwide marketer of retail energy -- electricity and/or gas -- and home security,"" Everen Securities analyst Dan Rudakas said. ""This combination gives them direct access to another 735,000 gas customers, which in the future ... would be potential electric customers and also electronic home security customers.""
The companies said the alliance will position the companies to take advantage of the expected deregulation of the electricity industry, allowing customers to buy electrical power from several sources instead of just the local utility. That type of deregulation is already taking place in the natural gas industry.
""Eventuallly there will be total competition in electricity and in gas,"" John Hayes Jr, Western Resources chairman, told a teleconference. ""We are just preparing for the future.""
The companies said Oneok's independence would be preserved by standstill provisions in the agreement that define the rights and responsibilities of the respective companies for at least the next 15 years.
Western Resources will receive a preferred dividend of 1.5 times the underlying common dividend, which now stands at 30 cents a share, but no less than $1.80 per preferred share per year for the first five years.
George K. Baum analyst Dennis Hudson said Western Resources' natural gas assets earned that company about $20 million in 1995. As part of Oneok, the assets likely will earn more, given that company's expertise in gas distributions and synergies from its existing gas business.
With its stake in Oneok, Western Resources will still benefit from a portion of the gas earnings, as well as future gas alliances that Oneok might enter into in the future.
""Oneok would continue to search for opportunities to acquire more customers on the gas side. We're most supportive of that,"" Wittig said.
He added that Western Resources continues to look for ways to expand its electricity and home-security businesses.

36,"Nalco Chemical Co Chairman Ted Mooney said he is comfortable with analysts' estimates for fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.50 to $0.51 per fully diluted share, up from $0.45 from continuing operations a year ago.
""We're comfortable with that,"" Mooney said in a telephone interview.  
Looking ahead, the water treatment and process chemicals company expects to increase earnings by a double-digit rate.
""Our overall goal is to grow double-digit, and we certainly think we can do that many more years than not,"" Mooney said. ""Next year, we don't see as atypical as yet.""
Earlier this week, Nalco reported third quarter earnings of $0.52 per fully diluted share from continuing operations, up 16 percent from $0.45 a year ago.
To increase its business, which is roughly equally divided between water treatment and process chemicals, Nalco will continue to make strategic acquisitions, Mooney said.  
Earlier today, Nalco, based in Naperville, Ill., agreed to acquire Nutmeg Technologies Inc, a Connecticut-based water treatment company with $9 million in annual sales.
""They (Nutmeg) are operating in an area that is growing rapidly and also have some very fine people,"" Mooney said.
Technical personnel in the water treatment business are a key asset given the range of customers served, from manufacturers to hospitals. Nalco's technology treats both water intake as well as water that is discharged.
Nalco also provides process chemicals to a variety of industries, such as paper-making.  
Nalco is also split in half between the United States and foreign markets, currently operating in about 20 countries.
With a global presence, Nalco, with about $1.4 billion in annual sales, is able to pursue opportunities wherever they arise, Mooney said. One down side, however, is that such globalization also makes it suspectible to regional economic downturns.  
For example, Nalco's European division, which accounts for 25 percent of its foreign business, faces tough economic conditions there. And as a U.S. company, Nalco's European profits suffer when converted into a stronger U.S. dollar.
""We are growing in dollar terms, if at all, very slowly in Europe right now,"" Mooney said.
Balancing that weakness in Europe, Nalco is growing by about double-digits in the United States, which accounts for about half the business.  
Nalco's business in the Asia/Pacific market, which accounts for 12 to 13 percent of company revenue, currently is growing at 15 to 20 percent. In Latin America, which also accounts for 12 to 13 percent of Nalco's business, growth is running at 15 to 20 percent, Mooney said.
""Wherever in the world it is, we'll go after that opportunity,"" Mooney said.

32,"Chad held much-delayed multi-party parliamentary elections on Sunday but there was little enthusiasm in the sprawling and volatile African nation for its fourth round of voting in less than a year.
Some polling stations in the capital opened late as voting materials were not ready for the scheduled 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) start. Few queues formed in the shimmering heat of the day and those that did were small.
Some opposition candidates denounced incidents of fraud but the 30 or so international observers reserved judgment and there were no immediate reports of electoral unrest in the majority Moslem nation with a lively southern Christian minority.
President Idriss Deby, the former northern guerrilla leader who seized power in a French-backed coup in 1990, paid tribute to Chad's democratic progress after voting in the capital.
""We have made a non-negligible step in the democratic process set up in 1990,"" he told reporters.
Others took a different view. ""Turnout will be low because people know the fraud apparatus is still in place and nothing much will change,"" said former national assembly leader Jean Bawoyeu Alingue, a defeated presidential hopeful.
More than 650 candidates from 49 parties contested the 125 seats in the national assembly, which will convene on March 31 to end the former French colony's transition to democracy.
Chad has known coups, civil war or conflict with northern neighbour Libya for much of its life from independence in 1960.
After repeated electoral delays, Deby won a multi-party presidential election in July after a run-off against southern rival and fellow general Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue.
Almost 68 percent of voters took part in the first round of that poll, which followed a March constitutional referendum. Voter interest tailed off in the second round.
A total of 3.5 million people were eligible to vote on Sunday in the nation on the fringes of the Sahara Desert. An estimated 300,000 nomads started voting on Thursday.
Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, leading member of the 27-party Republican Front coalition, started favourite to win or to be able to cobble together a working majority after the poll.
The opposition, which called a boycott of the presidential runoff alleging first-round fraud, has a 17-party coalition.
Election issues tended to be local or ethnic but diplomats said that all parties were looking for a fair distribution of any wealth from oil, which is expected to come on stream by the year 2000. Chad has about 100 ethnic groups.
""Oil is really what is at stake. Christian and Moslem differences have calmed,"" one diplomat said.
""It does not take much to make people feel better off,"" Alingue said. ""We don't want to see the money vanish abroad.""
Polls were to close at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). Election officials expected provisional results within 10 days and final results by January 25, once the appeal court had checked them. Any run-offs will be held on February 23.

32,"Revisions to Ivory Coast's coffee and cocoa auction system have been finalised in line with donor loan conditions and need only government blessing to come into effect, donor sources and exporters say.
""It could be done in 12 hours if the government wanted it,"" one exporter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Talks with the World Bank and the Caistab cocoa and coffee marketing board to boost transparency and prevent overbidding were concluded in September, he said.
""There will be a weighted allocation among the highest bidders in proportion to the size of each bid,"" said a banker close to the reforms.
The Caistab launched an electronic screen auction system to replace telephone dealing six months late in May to meet World Bank loan conditions, but it has been under review since July after complaints.
Bankers said the final touches needed ministerial approval before $45 million of a three-tier $150 million World Bank loan to Ivory Coast could be disbursed in mid-October.
""There will be changes in management rules when Yves-Marie Koissy (the new Caistab president) arrives but the management will have to be approved by the government rather than the Caistab,"" one told Reuters.
The exporter confirmed that the Caistab would award export contracts for the price and quantity bid by the five highest bidders, but bids would be downscaled pro-rata if they outstripped total sales slated for that session.
One source close to the market said the system had been flawed. ""If you knew the quantity on sale at a particular time you place a high bid for the right amount and walk away with the lot. Apart from that it was a matter of speculation with the best information to hand or who you knew,"" said another.
Smaller exporters, cooperatives and unions say exporters with less financial clout in international markets were pushed aside by overbidding.
Caistab staff said Koissy, appointed in September but yet to finish his contract with the International Monetary Fund in Washington, was due in Ivory Coast on October 9-10.
This raised expectations that the 1996/97 cocoa marketing season would open as announced on October 15 despite some doubts in the market. Koissy would then leave again to return at the end of the month.
Exporters had complained that two European-backed firms had priced others out of the market earlier this year to win contracts under a rule that rewarded the highest bidders.
Under the existing system the Caistab offers to sell an undisclosed quantity of produce in two daily sessions.
The highest bidder in terms of price gets the quantity he requests at the second highest bid price provided there is enough produce on offer. Anything left over goes to the next highest biddder at his price and subsequent buyers thereafter.
Donor sources say $60 million of the $150 million loan have been granted already as the auction system was in place even though about 600,000 tonnes of the 1996/97 had been sold forward by telephone before the auction opening in May.
""We expect next year's crop to be entirely sold through the auction. This year the only condition was for it to be operational,"" a source close to the negotiations said.
He said a third, $45 million, part of the loan would be given in 1997 depending on the auction's success. London trader ED &amp; F Man in a September report put the total forward sale of 1996/97 crop by the end of August at 590,000 tonnes, 65,000 up on the previous year.
""I would say the figure, which is not really known, is closer to 500,000,"" said the source close to the negotiations. ""Next year all the cocoa should be sold on the system.""

32,"Delegates to Ivory Coast's cocoa Consultative Committee focused on bean quality and marketing on Thursday, the mid-point of their review of industry reforms.
""I would prefer to get down to talking about cocoa quality and continuity of supply,"" Cacao Barry managing director Alain Leblond said before the second day of the talks, which end on Friday.
Ivory Coast's Consultative Committee, a tripartite group of Ivorian, industry and donor officials, was set up in 1996 to monitor cocoa sector reforms since 1990.
After opening the talks on Wednesday, International Cocoa Organization Chief Executive Edouard Kouame said changes must benefit farmers and other local players.
""At the same time the legitimate interests of others in the sector must be safeguarded,"" he added, referring to foreign traders, cocoa butter manufacturers, and chocolate and confectionary industries.
An electronic export contract auction set up in May 1996 to increase market transparency is widely seen as encouraging overbidding and concentrating export contracts in a few hands.
Local exporters, allocated 85 percent of contracts, and foreign traders, allocated 15 percent, have complained they cannot win export contracts at favourable prices.
""The question needs to be asked how some people can bid as much as they have (been bidding),"" Cocoa Association of London Chief Executive Philip Sigley told Reuters.
Industry concerns have been voiced about quality since the state marketing monopoly was ended.
""Quality has to do with liberalisation and the auction system,"" Netherlands Cocoa Association Managing Director Louis Bensdorp told Reuters. ""The lack of quality checks is the major problem. That and the second thing, the education of farmers.""
Industry watchers are wondering whether strong arrivals so far in 1996/97 means that output will rival the 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) record of 1.2 million tonnes.
""There is a very good crop coming in which suggests that last year was not a fluke of nature,"" said Bensdorp.
Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze declined to confirm whether buoyant cocoa arrivals would mean an adjustment of the Caistab state marketing board's 1996/97 production forecast of 950,000 tonnes. Industry forecasts are increasingly putting total output at more than one million tonnes.
Industry delegates said mid-crop forecasts for April to September had not yet been finalised.
""It is still too early to talk about the mid-crop but it tends to be bigger and bigger,"" said Bensdorp.
Ivory Coast wants to process 50 percent of its output by 2000 to shore up world prices and add value the cocoa sector's output.
At least two cocoa processors have expressed interest in building factories in Ivory Coast.

32,"Ivory Coast and other African coffee nations will hold talks with Vietnam on Tuesday on robusta output ahead of an emergency meeting of coffee producers in Rio de Janeiro on January 23, InterAfrican Coffee Organisation (IACO) officials said on Monday.
""The Vietnam meeting is a seminar to convince Vietnamese at the highest level to join the ACPC,"" IACO Secretary General Aregu Worku told Reuters, referring to the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC).
""There will also be a fact-finding mission with tours to plantations to see developments in Vietnamese production and techniques,"" he said by telephone.
Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze, also IACO's chairman, has already left Abidjan for Vietnam where the Asia International Coffee Conference '97, organised by IBC Singapore, is being held in Ho Chi Minh City from January 14 to 18.
Gauze was accompanied by IACO's chief economist Donald Kaberuka, Worku said. Ivory Coast's new Caistab marketing board coffee department director Avi Adroh will also attend.
Gauze in November blamed non-ACPC member exporters, including Vietnam, for instability in the world robusta price. He called for an urgent ACPC review.
""The real talks will take place in Rio de Janeiro (at the January 23 meeting) when proposals made by the African group will be discussed,"" said Worku.
African producers would renew demands for an additional 2.5 million bags export quota cut for the first six months of 1997.
""That is the area we have been talking about,"" said Worku, adding that Ivory Coast had stuck to its ACPC quota while non-members had increased production.
""Indonesia has insisted on Vietnam joining and we will have to come up with something in Rio to be able to stick with our strategy after June,"" said Worku.
Gauze and Kaberuka were expected to arrive in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday night or Tuesday morning for the Vietnam talks, an IACO secretary said.

32,"Ivory Coast's 1996/97 coffee crop is set to return to the 250-300,000-tonne levels seen before farmers neglected their trees in the early 1990s, exporters and up-country buyers say.
Coffee output in 1995/96 was around 180,000 tonnes and experts see the increase as part of a new good-moderate-weak cycle that tends to dominate the sector.
""It is a very good crop although there are some quality problems,"" one San Pedro exporter told Reuters.
""I think the crop will be at least 250,000 tonnes,"" said a large buyer visited in the coffee-rich areas around Man and Vavoua. ""Exporters are not yet buying and the world price is still very low.""
Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan last week said the crop would exceed 200,000 tonnes after a 32 billion CFA franc rehabilitation plan, favourable weather and better maintenance.
The government set a higher 1995/96 price to encourage production, but reference farmgate coffee prices were set lower this year to lessen government subsidisation of the sector.
Ivory Coast slashed its 1996/97 farmgate price to 500 CFA from 700 CFA for unhulled green coffee cherries, with lower prices for hulled cherries.
Most buyers and exporters visited by Reuters in a tour this week have not yet seen a full 1996/97 marketing list detailing their commissions, but they said they would have to accept rates shown in a copy obtained by Reuters.
""Buyers will lose out on commission,"" said one. Exporters said operations would go ahead in spite of some objections.
The new marketing season opened on November 14, delayed from early October.
Coffee marketing would get underway from mid-December as usual after cocoa harvests tail off, San Pedro exporters said.
""Most coffee is now held in village stores and the weather means drying and sorting will take more time,"" said one buyer.
Good yields meant some farmers had stripped ripe and unripe beans and mixed them together, they said.
Large amounts of coffee, both green and ripe red cherries, were this week seen by Reuters drying, some mixed together, along roadsides and in bush clearings, particularly in the north. Green cherries are bought at discounted prices.
Well-managed plantations visited were harvesting once a month but many trees around villages showed signs of unselective stripping, buyers said.
""Farmers take less care when quantities rise so we will have to consider the price,"" said a Daloa buyer. ""Exporters have not put in orders yet so we are not buying.""
One Abidjan-based exporter who went up-country this week also said quality was down. ""It is pretty bad in some places but the quantities are excellent,"" he said.
One crop analyst recently forecast 1996/97 production at 230,000 tonnes but most buyers and exporters said the figure was too low. Some up-country buyers said output could even be higher than 250,000 tonnes.
One expected 300,000 tonnes this year but most estimates put 1996/97 yields at one-third higher than the previous season, matching expected percentage drops in cocoa output.
A mild dry season favouring flowering and the natural production cycle of coffee trees had lifted the crop from a relatively poor 180,000 tonnes range in 1995/96, said Jean Toullec, a plantation manager in Gagnoa.
""I think 250,000 tonnes is possible as farms are being well maintained,"" he said. ""We are seeing 600 kg of coffee per hectare each harvest instead of 450.""

32,"Ivorian 1996/97 cocoa arrivals stood at around 390,000-410,000 tonnes by mid-December, after a slow start to the month, analysts and exporters say.
Exporters blamed a combination of crop profile and demand factors for the dip in December -- usually the strongest month.
The figures to December 16 were down from an estimated 540,000 tonnes by that date last year, but some analysts said a further 50,000 tonnes should be added to this year's total for comparative purposes as the season had opened three weeks late.
An averaged figure plus the 50,000 tonnes would put arrivals since October 1 at 450,000. Various sources put arrivals at San Pedro since October 1 at 130,000-140,000 tonnes with the rest going to the main port of Abidjan.
""Arrivals were slower than usual for December but in the past week arrivals have overtaken last year's (weekly) rate,"" said one exporter. ""People are completing December contracts but January will be strong,"" he added.
Subsequent arrivals up to December 22 were said by exporters to be around 50,000 tonnes per week. They expected the deficit in arrivals compared to last year to grow in December before narrowing sharply in January, when arrivals pick up again.
Difficulty in obtaining export contracts from the Caistab marketing board and problems with bean drying after rains upcountry had accentuated the usual Christmas period drop-off.
Rains had damaged bushtracks, delaying collection and raising humidity and moisture to above acceptable levels in some areas.
""We are refusing some cocoa. There is a lot more coming down now the sun is out,"" said one Abidjan-based exporter.
Drying problems and poor fermentation had raised bean humidity to 11 percent in some areas, extending both normal and machine drying times.
""Humidity levels are slipping back down from anything up to 11 percent,"" said one San Pedro-based buyer, and the guideline farmgate price of 315 CFA per kilo had on the whole been paid to growers.
Upcountry buyers visited by Reuters over Christmas had taken the chance to dry out large quantities of fresh through to greyish moist beans as a wet early December gave way to usual dry sunny weather ahead of the holiday.
""It's patchy, but sunny days are here again,"" said one buyer. ""Whatever was cut off in village stores or too wet can now be properly dried out,"" he added.
San Pedro received over 15,000 in the week from December 16, exporters there said.
Reports of smuggling to Guinea continue to surface but one Western diplomat recently returning by road from Conakry said road conditions were appalling and few covered trucks had been seen.
Large shipments in the past weeks are expected to cut into port stocks.
""Port area stocks are unclear but there are a lot of bulk shipments,"" said one exporter.

32,"Bulk cocoa shipments from West Africa will more than double to 325,000 tonnes in 1996/97, solidifying a cost-cutting trend sparked by recent trial shipments, exporters and shippers said.
""West African shipments will reach at least 325,000 tonnes this year (1996/97),"" said one trader, with most going to large Amsterdam-based buyers. ""And that is only a start."" he added.
Bulk shipments include beans stuffed directly into containers or poured loose into ship's holds, replacing traditional stacks of 60 kg jute bags.
Ivory Coast would ship about 270,000 tonnes in bulk this year. The world's largest producer blazed the trail by shipping 120,000 tonnes in 1995/96 as bagged cocoa lost favour with large buyers, said the source.
Of this year's total, about 260,000 tonnes would be shipped for two Amsterdam-based clients out of an expected crop of 900,000 to one million tonnes, said the trader.
Less than half, about 120,000 tonnes, would be shipped loose on holds against the same tonnage for all forms of bulk shipments in 1995/96. The remainder would be leave in twenty-foot bag-lined containers packed with drying agents.
Additional shipments of about 5,000 tonnes for trials to Germany, and less for Mediterranean ports would take the total of both bulk methods to around 270,000 tonnes.
Ghana is also expected to build on small shipments with 25,000 tonnes possibly leaving in December. Volumes from Nigeria and Cameroun are widely expected to rise.
Little was shipped in bulk from other West African ports last year but shipping companies say that will change.
Dutch transporters Spliethoffe completed three successful trials from Ivory Coast in 1995/96 totalling about 10,000 tonnes followed by another 110,000 tonnes for processors Gerkens and Cacao De Zaan.
The loading and shipment methods developed then has prompted an expected 100 percent plus jump in overall regional tonnages for 1996/97, say shippers.
Shipping lines Nedlloyd, Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) and Delmas (SDV) are already taking bulk cargos from forwarders SAGA and Delmas, and Ivorian exporters/forwarders Jean-Abile Gal and SIFCA.
""Each have loading systems (total of 8) in Abidjan and San Pedro (Ivory Coast's second port) but only direct users have reception facilities,"" a West Africa region shipping manager said. ""Not everyone has a 4,000 tonnes a day capacity plant with storage facilities,"" he added, referring to large processors in Amsterdam.
""In future, about  25 percent of all cocoa will leave in bulk,"" said one shipping manager, depending on the size of the reference crop
The manager of another shipper handling large volumes put the figure at 40 percent by 2000 for Ivory Coast.
""The economics are simple. What used to be shipped in four containers is now shipped in three,"" he said, or 100 tonees per six 20 foot containers.
Shipping companies had gained a 25 percent freight space saving and exporters would expect rebates in return, he said.
A typical charter on FIOS (free in and out, stowed) rates would be 55 dollars, with another 25 dollars in handling to be added depending on terms, said one shipping line.
The marginal cost of loading a container was about 3,750 CFA a tonne with 55,000 CFA for positioning a container, but labour and time savings more than compensated. Conveyor belts, silos and tip-up containers are all used for loading.
Plans to build a new bulk reception warehouse in Amsterdam unveiled by Dutch Cocoa Association (NCV) president Louis Bensdorp on Friday would encourage bulk cocoa advocates, said local exporters.

32,"Cocoa arrivals at Ivory Coast's ports this season could be 25 percent below last season's record 1.2 million tonne because of erratic weather and insect damage starting in July, buyers and exporters around San Pedro say.
They predict cumulative arrivals to the end of November of around 250,000 tonnes and of up to 300,000 for December.
""Mid-December to February will dip because of the rains in July,"" said one exporter in the southwestern port. ""Harvests will now be later and more prolonged, but not over 900,000 tonnes.""
Buyers said heavy July and August rains hurt flowers for December and January pods. Sunshine after August had helped the outlook for March while lighter rains, which started in early November, would boost flowering for mid-crop pods.
Widespread wilting of smaller pods was noted this week on on southwestern farms east and north of San Pedro last visited in September. Insect damage and ""black pod"" fungus had also been noticeable.
The Ivory Coast has slated 950,000 tonnes for its total 1996/97 output after private forecaster estimates of 850-900,000 for the main crop alone. The 1995/96 season hit a 1.2 million tonnes record after a higher than expected mid-crop of 200,000 tonnes.
But one San Pedro exporter said, ""There will be no more than 900,000 tonnes for the whole year. It could have been better but pod deterioration, insects and maybe even the trees' natural cycle have had an effect.""
Local buyers and other exporters in the southwest agree, some putting the output at even less, but they say mid-crop predictions are unreliable.
Few flowers and pods were seen on coastal farms and little cocoa was drying along roadsides. Tree pods and village stores were more plentiful in productive Meadji and Soubre areas.
Exporters and buyers in the southwest now matching cocoa arrivals data with last season's say volumes are down, with humidity higher at 8-10 percent and smaller bean sizes of between 93 and 100 per 100 grammes, against 85-90 last year.
""There is less cocoa than last year. It takes twice as long to fill a truck driving around the bush and it needs a lot of drying,"" said a buyer in Sassandra. Buyers elsewhere agreed.
Cumulative arrivals to end-November could be 250,000 tonnes, the sources said. One put registered cumulative arrivals at 213,000 to November 24, with 85,000 arriving in the week up to then. November arrivals last year topped 300,000.
Buyers and exporters foresee arrivals of around 250,000- 300,000 for December against about 400,000 in 1995/96.
A San Pedro exporters' agent said he had taken in 22,800 tonnes of cocoa this season with 10,000 still in stores and room for 25,000 more. Many San Pedro warehouses were full this time last year.
Another said their cumulative year-on arrivals were down 15 percent at November 24 and expected the gap to widen in December.
San Pedro's largest port handler expects up to 30 percent less volume this year and said arrivals to November 17 totalled 70,000 tonnes. The port expects to handle a third of this year's crop.
Cocoa quality is good but some mouldy, moist and deteriorated beans were being mixed in the rush to supply exporters.
""Some buyers can charge higher prices as export contracts have been sold up to March and have to be met,"" said one. Mould levels were around four percent, he added.
Some buyers have supplied farmers with insecticides and say dry Harmattan weather moving southwards will help drying. One 15-tonne capacity dryer was out of action after a fire at a San Pedro plant on Saturday.
Exporters said they now accept the 1996/97 list of marketing prices set by the government this month after a late start to the season. But they said the Caistab marketing board had not altered its auctioning system to prevent overbidding.
Smaller exporters say some people have been laid off until March as they cannot match prices bid over opening calls.
""About 750,000 tonnes have been sold to highest bidders but the Caistab has not sold the 15 percent it retains. Maybe they are waiting for higher world prices,"" one exporter said.
A San Pedro factory said it aimed to process 25-30,000 tonnes of cocoa this year.

32,"After years of war-induced poverty, gum arabic is offering drought-stricken Chad's rural poor a lifeline to the production plants of the world's food and beverage giants.
The name gum arabic may mean little to most people but the sticky acacia tree sap balls are a valued commodity in companies as diverse as Coca Cola Co, drug manufacturer Hoechst and bubble gum factories around the globe.
For impoverished sub-Saharan states producing the bulk of world demand, gum arabic simply means export currency.
""Gum arabic is one of nature's best emulsifiers but the industry has suffered from low prices in recent years,"" a senior U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) official said.
""But with synthetic food-substitutes losing favour prices could move up again as quality is improved,"" FAO's programme director Mahamat Ali Hassam told Reuters in the capital N'Djamena.
Soft drinks makers now consume 30 percent of world output but it is also used in sweets such as pastilles and chewing gum. The food industry uses it as a stabiliser and a preservative.
Chad, neighbour of the world's largest gum arabic producer, Sudan, is planning a quality blitz to win markets after years of falling yields and bloody turf disputes between foraging nomads and commercial farmers.
""About 70-80 percent of world output (about 35,000 tonnes) is African with Sudan producing 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes,"" said FAO Chad director Pierre Gence. ""But Chad has the potential to match Sudan's output.""
The FAO and the French aid agency Caisse Francaise de Developpement (CFD) are both working on projects to propel Chad's output to 30,000 tonnes from around 3,000 tonnes today.
Some experts say Chad has the capacity to produce 160,000 tonnes a year but that world demand would have to increase dramatically to accomodate that.
Gum arabic has a history dating back to ancient times. Arab traders brought it north from Africa in caravans to Middle Ages Europe and the Middle East along with gold, ivory and slaves.
It is also highly prized as a soluble food fibre because, unlike other strong vegetable emulsifiers with thickening and gelling qualities, it can be used in foods and beverages without altering texture.
It is used in everything from indelible ink for Chad's Koranic schools to textile dyes, glues, pastilles, perfumes and pharmaceutical products.
Despite traces of arsenic it is also nutritious, with 90 percent sugar and 2.5 percent each of fat and protein in addition to copper, calcium, sodium and magnesium.
Hungry nomads pluck gum arabic as they pass with grazing goats and cattle.
But state land rights for Chad's 25,000 producers are poorly defined. ""People get killed over this,"" said one French worker.
""Our studies aim to entirely review and reform the whole sector so everyone's interests are respected and output can grow,"" said a spokesman for the French CFD development agency.
Trees take five years to mature yielding about 150 grams in each of two main harvests between November and March.
""Some super-trees yield eight kg per harvest so we are trying to find out their genetic code and plant more,"" said the FAO's Mahamat Ali.
Gum arabic is dried from squash-ball sized yellow blobs of sap into quartz-like chunks and split into top grade Kitir followed by Tarlah grades before it enters a highly secretive marketing chain in 2.5 kg Corlo lots.
Marketing data is kept secret.
Commercial planting has not got underway but existing trees have suffered from 20 years of drought. Rains of 300-500 mm are needed whereas some areas are only forecast to get little over 100 mm in 1997. Chad has already appealed for food aid.
Chad's four-year ""Gum Arabic Project"" to 1999 seeks to improve knowledge of the sector and its practices -- from commercial tree bleeding, tooling, drying, sorting, stocking, transporting to dealing along the murky marketing chain.
The FAO's two-year $285,000 project up to 1997 on inventory assessment, mapping, training and standards completes the picture of sectoral reform.
Neighbouring countries are also planning more output, from Senegal, Burkina Faso, and across the arid Sahel desert fringe to strife-torn Central African Republic.
Nigeria is already second only to Sudan in terms of production. India is the main producer outside Africa.

32,"Exporters have united to oppose an Ivorian government plan to make them liable for income tax owed and frequently unpaid by upcountry buyers, exporters said on Tuesday.
Tax laws approved by parliament in February allowed for deductions equivalent to about 7.5 percent of commission paid by exporters to agents buying cocoa on their behalf in the 1996/97 season, they told Reuters.
""Because we hold export licences does not mean we are qualified to act as tax collectors. We are in discussions with the government,"" GEPEX exporters' forum president, Rene Ekra, told Reuters on Tuesday.
One exporter said the dispute had contributed to export delays at the start of the 1996/97 marketing season but a decision was expected by the end of the week. ""Banks are ready to finance but we still do not have an export rate to work on and now we are into November,"" he said.
Exporters say the plan means a deduction of about 2.5 CFA per kilo from buyers' commissions. Buyers are currently paid a 1995/96 commission rate of about 32 CFA per kilo of collected cocoa, but Ivory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing year October 24 without setting new reference rates for exporters and buyers along the farmgate-to-shipment marketing chain.
Exporters say if the law is applied, tax collection costs should be given by the government to exporters.
""We would also have to find ways of getting buyers to pay up and cover the tax collection costs if it goes through,"" one told Reuters.
Donors say the plan is part of a clampdown on tax evasion by up-country buyers.
""Buyers must pay their income tax and the government has found it difficult to get them to pay. The idea is to get exporters to pay it up front,"" said a bank official.
Exporters say the tax plan is poorly defined as well as misdirected.
""We cannot pay such amounts in advance,"" said one. ""For every thousand tonnes exporters would have to pay the govenment 2.5 million CFA (francs).""
Some up-country buyers said they would avoid the tax by setting up as GVCs, tax-exempt buyers' cooperatives currently under government review for lack of accounting transparency.
""It would be easy to hire someone to set up on that basis,"" said one trader, but cooperatives say laws under consideration could make such a move more difficult.
""Buyers might set up as GVCs but it will be harder in future. Accounting standards might be tightened later this year and licensing could be stricter,"" a UNECACI farm cooperative leader said.
Exporters say the law might not be implemented. ""It is possible. GVCs crop up and disappear overnight. There is talk of tightening up GVC management but no sign of it yet."" said one.
The government has had problems identifying traitants because of the sporadic nature of their work and their locations, said one international banker. ""Exporters usually know whom the buyers are as well as where they are,"" he added.

21,"Glasgow-based Stakis Plc and Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal are the likely purchasers of the Metropole and Princess hotel chains from Lonrho Plc, analysts said on Wednesday.
British conglomerate Lonrho, in the throes of a demerger, said last month it had received interest from potential buyers of the hotels and shelved plans to float them.
The London daily Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the sale of the chains for more than 650 million pounds ($1 billion) could be completed within the next fortnight. There was no immediate comment from Lonrho on the report.
Stakis, which has some 46 British hotels, has refused to comment on reports it planned to buy the five Metropole properties. But the hotels and casino group remains the clear favourite to clinch a deal.
""It would be an excellent fit for Stakis. It's just the size of the deal that could cause concern,"" said analyst Fraser Ramzan of Lehman Brothers.
Markets have speculated that Stakis was planning a rights issue to fund the purchase of the Metropole hotels, valued at about 350 million pounds.
The Metropole group comprises five business and conference hotels located in the British cities of London and Birmingham and the seaside towns of Brighton and Blackpool.
Hotelier Millennium &amp; Copthorne, floated in London this year, has effectively ruled itself out of the race. A company spokesman said Millennium had looked at the Metropole hotels but was not in talks to buy them.
Meanwhile. Prince al-Waleed is believed to be negotiating the purchase of the Princess chain, 10 properties of resorts in the United States, the Caribbean and Mexico.
Financial sources in the Gulf told Reuters this month that al-Waleed had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal at a price of $300 million. The prince has major investments in New York's luxury Plaza hotel, the Four Seasons hotel group, in the banking group Citicorp and Disneyland Paris theme park.
The hotel business is in a growth phase as economic recovery on both sides of the Atlantic help drive occupancy rates.
But there have also been a glut of hotel companies coming to Britain's market, with Jarvis Hotels and Thistle following the example of Millennium &amp; Copthorne.
And there are signs of investor indigestion, as witnessed by recent cancellations of stock market floats.
Analysts said investors were now looking much more closely at the merits of individual companies but said they still expected the sector to remain positive into 1997.
""Over the past year, people have become far more discerning about the type of hotel business they become involved in. But that does not mean they are reluctant to invest in the sector,"" said Greg Feehley of Kleinwort Benson.
And if that is the case, there is also no shortage of property on the market, with British media and leisure group Granada selling 17 luxury hotels in Britain and overseas.  The hotels, known as the Exclusive range, were acquired by Granada as part of the 3.9 billion pound takeover of leading British hotelier Forte last January.
American hotel companies ITT Sheraton and Marriott are reportedly among potential purchasers for the chain. A deal is expected to be concluded around the turn of the year.
"
21,"Marjorie Scardino, set to become Pearson chief executive in January, rejects the tag of company insider and has vowed to carry out radical change at the British media firm ""if needed"".
Selecting an American woman to head a top British company was certain to raise a few eyebrows in the City of London. But initial doubts are paradoxically based on the fact that she is seen as part of the Pearson family rather than a newcomer.
""The message that this appointment puts across is that we can expect more of the same from the company. That's not what the market wanted to hear,"" said one media analyst.
Scardino, 49, is chief executive of business publisher The Economist Group, 50 percent owned by Pearson.
But she said that The Economist is run as an independent operation and she is not part of the Pearson establishment.
""I would like to put that one to rest - I am an outsider to Pearson,"" the mother-of-three told Reuters.
She said that she had spoken to the members of the Pearson board and had been assured that they were prepared to accept radical change ""if needed"".
She said she was well aware of press and market criticism of a lack of management focus at Pearson, a company whose activities range from the Financial Times to Australian soap opera ""Neighbours"".
Pearson has sold off businesses in wine, china and oil services in recent years to concentrate on three media-related areas -- Information, Education and Entertainment.
""I know this company has been broken up and put back together (by journalists and analysts) in all kinds of ways. I think I'm aware of all the possibilities.""
There was more bad press on Thursday as the market questioned her qualifications.
""She's apparently been very successful at the Economist but it's not the same as running a major PLc,"" said one analyst.
But she received a glowing reference from Economist chairman Dominic Cadbury: ""I am sure that she will move quickly to assess the Pearson business and define a new strategic direction which she will set about implementing,"" he said.
Profits at the Economist have more than doubled during her three years as chief executive. Scardino is also a director of U.S. food giant ConAgra Inc and British retailer WH Smith.
Born in Arizona but brought up in Texas, Scardino worked in the 1970s as a lawyer in Savannah, Georgia -- the hometown of her journalist husband.
By night she helped him with his weekly Georgia Gazette newspaper where he won a Pulitzer prize for his work.
She moved to New York in the mid 1980s where she headed the Economist's North American operations for several years.
She lives in the swish west London quarter of Knightsbridge with husband Albert. The couple have three children -- the youngest of whom is making a name for himself as an actor.
Indeed, Hal Scardino, 11, is maybe better known than his high-powered Mum. His films include Marvin's Room with Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton and Robert de Niro and The Indian in the Cupboard, for which he won a best child actor award.
""He's been in a couple of movies but I wouldn't call him a star,"" she said. Her other son, Will, is 16 while daughter Adelaide, 18, has just returned to the U.S. to study.
"
21,"The director-general of the BBC called on Friday for an increase in the British television licence fee to protect what he said was ""the most successful cultural institution in the world"".
Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, John Birt said the fee -- payable by all television set owners -- had fallen in real terms over the past decade and described the recent financial history of the BBC as ""miraculous"".
He said an increase was needed to help fund new services as digital technology multiplies the number of channels available.
""The BBC is the most successful cultural institution in the world, one of the great inventions of the 20th century. But it can no longer be taken for granted,"" Birt said.
""If it (the BBC) is to innovate with high-quality services in the new technologies as it has done again and again ... then at some point in the future -- and for the first time since 1985 -- we shall need a real increase in the licence fee.""
A colour television licence costs 89.50 pounds ($139.10) annually. Licence income totals around 1.8 billion pounds each year -- 95 percent of BBC income. The money funds the BBC's five national radio stations as well as its two television channels.
Sources at the BBC said it wanted a modest rise in ""low single (percentage) figures over time"". The BBC will shortly begin talks with the government to review the licence fee -- currently pegged to inflation.
Any price increase would take effect from April 1, 1997. A general election is due in Britain by next May and the government might be reluctant to saddle viewers with a higher licence fee shortly before it went to the polls.
Birt said the BBC was now towards the bottom of the European licence fee league table. He added that a top-rate subscription to satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay television, costs 300 pounds annually.
The BBC says it has achieved cost savings of 100 million pounds in each of the past three years and aims to build on its commercial success as Europe's biggest broadcasting exporter.
But Birt said more licence money was vital.
Digital technology -- which will allow the creation of hundreds of new channels and interactive services such as home shopping -- is set to reach Britain next year.
BSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite services in late 1997 and a terrestrial version is expected to follow within a further 12 months.
The BBC is planning to offer licence-fee payers supplementary programming and a 24-hour news service as it moves into the digital era.
""It (digital) will mean upholding our national role -- and opening new doors wherever we can for licence fee payers,"" Birt added.

21,"British pay television operator BSkyB said on Friday that it was considering further investment in Germany and would beam its second pay-per-view sports event into Britain later this month.
The satellite broadcaster said pre-tax profit had risen by 31 percent to 66 million pounds ($107.5 million) in the three months to September 30.
The company, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, said that total paying subscribers had reached 5.65 million at 30 September, a net increase for the quarter of 146,000.
""The company has performed strongly in the first quarter and has achieved significant growth in both revenue and profits,"" said BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm.
""Our increased investment in all areas of programming and the quality and choice we offer our subscribers will maintain our impetus,"" he added.
Operating revenues for the three months to September 30 increased to 266 million pounds, a rise of 24 percent on a year earlier. Earnings per share were 3.9 pence, 30 percent up.
BSkyB shares rose 4p to 582-1/2p although analysts said the subscriber growth figures were ""unexciting"" and the profits in line with expectations.
BSkyB said in July that it would take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1, the German digital television venture launched by Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch. BSkyB said on Friday it was considering investments in additional German Pay TV channels.
DF1 has made a slow start but the German pay television market is expected to expand rapidly in coming years.
BSkyB said it would show its second pay-per-view event on November 9 when Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield meet in Las Vegas for the WBA heavyweight boxing crown.
BSkyB successfully experimented with pay-per-view when Tyson fought Briton Frank Bruno in March. More than 600,000 homes paid some 10 pounds to see that fight.
BSkyB has said it plans to introduce digital satellite broadcasting into Britain late next year. Pay-per-view sports events and movies are likely to be one of the prime sources of income from the extra channels provided by digital.
Niche channels Sky Scottish and The Computer Channel were launched on Friday, bringing the total number of channels available on Sky Television to over forty.
However, Friday's planned launch of WBTV-The Warner Channel was postponed at the 11th hour on Thursday evening.
The Warner Channel -- a mixture of Bugs Bunny cartoons and vintage movies -- was apparently a victim of the legal battle being fought in the United States between Murdoch and the combined might of CNN founder Ted Turner and Time Warner.
That clash of the titans centres on whether Time Warner, the second largest U.S. cable operator, will carry News Corp's 24-hour Fox News Service in New York City. Fox is a major rival to CNN, now part of Time Warner following a recent merger. ($1=.6141 Pound)

21,"Shares in Britain's newly-demerged EMI Group Plc rose on Tuesday as the stock market applauded the company's resilience to tougher conditions in the music market.
EMI, which split from rentals company Thorn Plc three months ago, said profit before tax and exceptional items rose nine percent to 112.5 million pounds ($188.4 million) in the six months to September 30. Net interim dividend per share increased by 12.7 percent to eight pence.
EMI shares, which have shed some two pounds in recent weeks on fears that global music sales were faltering after a decade of strong growth, had added 9-1/2p to 1,280-1/2p by 1330 GMT after earlier climbing to 1290p.
""These are excellent interim results from the EMI Group,"" chairman Sir Colin Southgate said in a statement.
""They have been achieved against a background of variable growth in the major markets and mixed results from our competitors,"" he added. ""The increase in the interim dividend reflects our confidence in the long-term health of the music industry and EMI's position within it.""
Analysts said that EMI appeared in better shape than some of its rivals in a patchy worldwide market.
""What we have seen from their competitors was poor but EMI is insulated as it does not have so much exposure to the U.S.,"" said media analyst Lorna Tilbian of brokers Panmure Gordon, adding: ""They tend to be strong in the areas where the growth is coming through.""
Panmure are forecasting full-year profit excluding exceptional items of 403 million pounds and have a target share price of 1360p.
Finance Director Simon Duffy said EMI remained confident that the global music business would continue to grow by some 6-8 percent annually in the medium to long-term.
""This year is looking a little bit below that level,"" said Duffy, adding that markets were mixed but that overall first half music sales growth had been 5.5 percent. However, he added that the impact for EMI was diluted by the strength of sterling.
The market's sluggishness has recently been reflected by 100 layoffs at various labels within Warner Music and 400 job cuts at PolyGram NV -- two other music majors.
EMI said that sales in the United States were almost flat and declined slightly in France. But this was offset by improvements in Japan, Britain and Germany while Southeast Asia and Latin America boasted particularly large gains.
Turnover from the EMI Music division was down marginally at around 1.1 billion pounds but analysts ascribed this to the effect of exchange rates. Better margins helped to boost operating profits in the EMI Music division to 131.9 million pounds from 124.6 million.
The HMV division, grouping record and book stores chains, had an operating loss of 11 million pounds which the company said was in line with expectations.
EMI said major releases for the key pre-Christmas quarter included the third and final Beatles Anthology album, which entered the American charts at number one. It is also releasing a triple album from The Artist Formerly Known as Prince and the debut from British newcomers the Spice Girls. ($1=.5970 Pound)
"
21,"Shares in Pearson Plc fell on Thursday as the stock market gave an initial thumbs-down to the appointment of an American woman publishing executive as chief executive of the British media group.
Marjorie Scardino, 49, chief executive of The Economist Group that is half owned by Pearson -- which publishes the Financial Times British business daily -- will succeed Frank Barlow as chief executive at the end of the year.
Her appointment ends a long period of uncertainty over the succession to Barlow, 66, who is retiring.
But market players were dismayed by her close ties with the Pearson group and the fact that a big name executive had not been brought in from outside to knock the business into shape.
""The message that this appointment puts across is that we can expect more of the same from the company. That's not what the market wanted to hear,"" said one media analyst.
Pearson shares fell to a low of 668 pence after the announcement. They recovered a little but still ended the day 13p lower at 675.
The company also announced that Dennis Stevenson, a non-executive director, becomes deputy chairman now and will take over from Michael Blakenham as chairman next May.
Scardino said that she was not a Pearson insider.
""I would like to put that one to rest -- I am an outsider to Pearson,"" she told Reuters.
She said that a trust agreement meant that Pearson directors remained in a minority on the Economist board. ""We jealously guard our independence, we're not a part of the Pearson group.""
Trained as a lawyer, Scardino helped her journalist husband to run the Pulitzer Prize winning local weekly the Georgia Gazette in the 1970s. The couple moved to New York in the 1980s where she headed the Economist's North American operation.
Share analysts say that her main task is to bring focus to Pearson, a sprawling media and leisure company which has a market capitalisation of almost four billion pounds ($6.3 billion).
Barlow has reshaped the company in his six years in charge, selling off the Royal Doulton china business and wine and oil industry interests. The company has focused on three divisions -- Information, Education and Entertainment. Its activities range from Australian soap opera to the Financial Times and analysts say not all pieces of the jigsaw fit.
Scardino, a mother of three, said she was prepared to make radical changes ""if needed"".
""I know this company has been broken up and put back together (by journalists and analysts) in all kinds of ways. I think I'm aware of all the possibilities.""
She won a ringing endorsement from Dominic Cadbury, her colleague as chairman of business publisher the Economist.
""I am sure that she will move quickly to assess the Pearson business and define a new strategic direction which she will set about implementing,"" he said.
""She has the appropriate experience of publishing and a background as a lawyer, as well as knowing the U.S. and British environments first hand, and has a great record of success in the Economist's growing business and circulation.""
Revenue has increased by almost 80 percent in her time at trhe Economist while profit after tax has more than doubled to 17.7 million pounds this year from 7.8 million in 1993. ($1=.6299 Pound)

21,"The planned $20 billion merger of British Telecom and MCI is certain to shake up the global telephone business, officials and analysts said Monday, as regulators started digging in for a close look at the deal.
British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp. on Sunday announced the largest trans-Atlantic takeover in history.
The deal would create a global powerhouse vying with AT&amp;T Corp., Germany's Deutsche Telekom and a handful of other companies in a fast-changing, lucrative industry that will be a critical component of global commerce well into the 21st century.
The proposal will create work aplenty for British, American and European regulators who will review the merger, which would create a $40 billion company serving 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.
For consumers, it could mean better service and lower international calling charges, while the new company would aim to better support its business customers around the world.
It will cause sleepless nights for rivals such as AT&amp;T, Sprint Corp., France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom as they weigh how to respond. Sprint is allied with the French and German companies in the Global One international venture while AT&amp;T is part of a network of alliances called World Partners.
The new company, to be called Concert, plans to take on AT&amp;T's dominance in the U.S. long-distance market, where MCI now has about 20 percent of a $75 billion business, and to win part of the $100 market for residential local phone service.
It also is expected to expand in the Asia-Pacific region -- a long-held aim for British Telecom.
British Telecom's stock jumped in London and New York, where its American shares rose $5.375 to $60.875 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
MCI shares also rose, but only 50 cents to $30.75, well below the possible value of as much as $39 a share based on the price of British Telecom's American shares. Worries about regulatory hurdles and the time to complete the deal held back the stock, industry analysts and takeover specialists said.
The merger still needed to win approval from regulators in America and Britain.
British Telecom said it was optimistic that the European Commission would clear the merger.
British officials have said only that they were looking at the deal. AT&amp;T has already called on the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to give it thorough scrutiny.
AT&amp;T also said U.S. and European regulators should not give approval unless there is more competition in British Telecom's home market.
British Telecom Chief Executive Sir Peter Bonfield has said it could take a year for the deal to win regulatory approval.
""There are a lot of hurdles to be cleared but I think the deal will go through,"" one London-based analyst said.
Federal rules prohibit a foreign company from owning more than 25 percent of a U.S. telephone company if the acquiror's home market is not open to competition.
Under the merger British Telecom, which already owns 20 percent of Washington-based MCI, will issue Concert cash and stock for the remaining 80 percent. Holders of MCI stock will end up controlling around a third of the merged company.
The merged company will acquire the 9 percent stake which MCI holds in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. media empire. MCI, perhaps wary of regulatory concerns, said on Sunday it did not plan to pursue an option to increase this to 13 percent.
"
21,"Executives from British Telecom Plc and MCI Communications Corp were on Saturday attempting to stitch together a $22 billion merger that would turn BT into the world's second largest telecoms group.
MCI, the number two U.S. long-distance phone company, sent shock waves through the global communications industry on Friday when it said it was in talks about a takeover by BT.
BT, the dominant player in the British market, has been building its overseas presence in recent years and already has a 20 percent stake in MCI. The two also operate a joint venture known as Concert which serves customers in more than 50 nations.
Analysts are speculating on a price of $40 a share -- valuing MCI at $28 billion and leaving BT with a bill of about $22.1 billion to pay for the remaining 80 percent of MCI.
The deal would be the biggest yet in the rapidly changing telecommunications market and the second largest involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
A BT spokesman confirmed that the BT board was meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI.
He would not be drawn on where the meeting was taking place, saying only that BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield was not in the United States.
The spokesman said an announcement was anticipated prior to the opening of the London stock market on Monday. Sources close to the talks said no announcement was likely on Saturday.
BT and MCI have both said there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated.
BT had unsuccessful merger talks earlier this year with British rival Cable &amp; Wireless -- a deal which would have created the world's fifth largest telecoms group by revenue.
Any BT/MCI deal would spawn a massive company with a market capitalisation of some $64 billion, just ahead of AT&amp;T Corp -- the leading, but struggling, U.S. phone company. It would still be some way behind Japanese giant NTT Data Corporation -- the world's largest.
Analysts said a merged company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry where MCI and number three Sprint have been battling AT&amp;T.
Its critical mass would leave it excellently placed to expand into other international markets and new technologies -- MCI possessing the biggest Internet backbone in the U.S.
""This is AT&amp;T Corp's worst nightmare,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.
AT&amp;T said late on Friday that it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.
""We would expect that our government would condition any such merger on the complete and unqualified opening of the telecom market in the United Kingdom,"" it said.
However, analysts regard the British market as broadly open to competition.
For its part, Britain's Trade and Industry Department (DTI) said on Saturday it was too early to say what regulatory hurdles any merger would have to clear.
One potential problem is a media joint venture between MCI and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. BT would end up with MCI's 13 percent non-voting stake in News Corp and this could cause regulatory difficulties in Britain.
British telecoms watchdog Oftel recently banned a joint advertising campaign between BT and satellite broadcaster BSkyB, a company in which News Corp is the main shareholder.
"
21,"Britain's commercial television watchdog on Thursday invited applications to run terrestrial frequencies which will multiply the number of channels available to viewers in the new digital age.
""This is a very important day for UK viewers...as many as 35 or 36 channels could be available on digital terrestrial television,"" said Peter Rogers, chief executive of the Independent Television Commission (ITC).
The ITC is seeking applications to operate four ""multiplexes"", as the blocks of frequencies are known. Each block can carry as many as six digital channels.
The BBC has already been earmarked its own multiplex, and commercial networks ITV and Channel 4 will share one.
The ITC will award the 12-year licences on critieria including speed of roll-out of the service and the appeal of programming but a cash bid will not be required. Licences are expected to be awarded next spring and broadcasting could begin by mid-1998.
Britain is leading the way in the development of digital terrestrial but some observers question whether it will succeed.
Pay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the largest shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service into Britain in late 1997 -- several months ahead of the terrestrial version.
The satellite version could offer several hundred channels and BSkyB's control of key movie and sporting rights are likely to make it an attractive proposition.
The ITC's Rogers told a news conference he was confident the terrestrial option would prove attractive to investors.
""I would be surprised and disappointed if we didn't have applications for all of the multiplexes,"" he said.
His view was shared by Paul Styles, a media expert at consultancy and accounting firm KPMG.
""Most people perceive digital bandwith to be valuable so I think there will be interest in the multiplexes,"" he said.
""This will not be an overnight sensation but a business to be built,"" he said, identifying ITV companies, cable groups and BSkyB itself as potential licence applicants.
Digital technology increases the number of channels which can be transmitted and enhances sound and picture quality. it also enables interactive services such as home shopping and home banking to be created.
Digital means converting sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones -- rather than transmitting them as electric signals as now happens. A set-top box or ""decoder"" will be required to receive digital services.
This is also a source of controversy, as ITC officials admit that there is no current UK or European legislation to enforce a common standard for decoders.
That means that consumers could theoretically have to pay several hundred pounds (dollars) for a set-top box to receive BSkyB's digital services and then have to buy a second box a few months later to receive digital terrestrial.
British Labour Euro MP Carole Tongue on Thursday wrote to European Commissioner Martin Bangemann to demand that all set-top boxes provide a common interface for all broadcasters.
"
21,"Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar said on Thursday that English soccer clubs could face financial ruin if they follow the example of big spenders such as Newcastle United.
Sugar was speaking after Premier League club Tottenham posted a record pre-exceptional profit of 10.2 million pounds ($16 million) for the 14 months to July 31. The club increased its total dividend to 5p from 3p.
English soccer is booming as television revenue helps to fund an influx of top foreign talents and the sector is seen as increasingly attractive for investors.
English champions Manchester United, listed along with Tottenham on the London Stock Exchange, this week announced an annual profit of 15 million pounds.
But Sugar warned that the Bosman Ruling under which players effectively become free agents at the end of their of their contracts was ""a devastating blow to the football industry"".
Sugar said he could not see the sense in deals such as privately-owned Newcastle's recent signing of England captain Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers for 15 million pounds.
""Even if you win everything in sight there is no way to make it pay,"" he said, noting that Newcastle would not be able to recoup any of their outlay on Shearer once his contract was up.
Tottenham, who reported 14-month figures because of a change in their financial year, took an exceptional charge of 7.3 million pounds to reflect a drop in the value of their squad.
The value fell after Belgian Jean-Marc Bosman won a landmark case at the European Court of Justice which ended the transfer fee system for players who were out of contract.
Sugar, who has a 40 percent stake in Tottenham, acknowledged that profit figures were meaningless to fans clamouring for new signings following the injury-hit team's indifferent start to the season.
He said funds were available to team manager Gerry Francis to strenghten the squad but declined to say how much.
""I would hope in the next two to three weeks that we will see some signings at the club,"" he added, saying that the club's aim was to sign promising young players on long-term contracts.
The head of consumer electronics group Amstrad, Sugar saved Tottenham from the verge of bankruptcy five years ago when he and former England coach Terry Venables took over the club.
But the two, both working-class London boys made good, fell out spectacularly and have become locked in a series of legal battles since Sugar forced Venables to leave the club in 1993. ($1=.6395 Pound)

5,"Most banks in the U.S. Midwest are expected to post third quarter earnings gains of 10 percent or more as the strong economy continues to generate loan growth, cost-cutting programs show results and credit quality remains reasonably sound.
""It looks like credit quality trends should hold up very well,"" said Michael Ancell, banking analyst at Edward D. Jones. He expects the banks he follows to have average earnings gains of 11 percent.  
For most of the year, analysts who follow banks have been waiting to see deterioration in credit quality, especially in credit card loans.
But while some banks, like First Chicago NBD, showed a higher charge-off rate in credit card receivables in the second quarter, a wider wave of loan quality problems has yet to appear, analysts said.
""I don't see large increases in (loan loss) provision,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp.  
Many banks have also been aggressively cutting costs, which should help third quarter results. Analysts pointed to Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp as one bank that could benefit from an aggressive cost-cutting plan.
Others point to banks that have been generating fee revenue, such as Northern Trust Corp and Norwest Corp, as also primed for strong gains.  
""Most people are working very hard at expense controls,"" said Thomas Maier, banking analyst at EVEREN Securities. ""I'm more in mind at looking more favorably at those banks that are strong revenue growers. Ultimately, you've got to sell product, in any business.""
Another factor helping gains in earnings per share is stock buyback programs, with many banks aggressively repurchasing their stock. First Bank System Inc, which announced a plan earlier this year to repurchase 25 million shares, was seen by analysts as one of the most aggressive on this front.  
Meanwhile, analysts said the 10 percent pace of earnings gains should continue into next year.
""Even though the credit quality cycle is not getting any better, it certainly is not getting any worse at any kind of a rapid pace,"" said Ben Crabtree, analyst at Dain Bosworth.

5,"U.S. retailers reported overall sales near plan for the key December holiday shopping month Thursday, but results varied widely by store and sector with department stores appearing to take some market share from specialty stores.
""The major retailers continue to gain market share,"" said Michael Niemira, analyst with Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi Ltd. ""Even within the Sears report, they talk about the electronics area being one of the stronger areas"" while that area was weak for retailers overall.""  
Sears, Roebuck and Co was one of the better performers, analysts said. The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based retailer said domestic same-store sales rose 9.5 percent.
Sears chairman Arthur Martinez told CNBC that gross margins are very favorable for December and the fourth quarter.
Sears stock was up 1-1/8 at 46-3/8 Thursday. Other gainers included Paul Harris Stores Inc, up 1-7/8 at 20-1/2, Kohl's Corp, up 1-1/4 at 37-3/4, Dayton Hudson Corp up one at 37-3/8 and Saks Holdings Inc up 5/8 at 39-5/8.

5,"The U.S. economy should provide a repeat in 1997 of the steady growth seen in 1996, which should also lead to car and truck sales near 1996 levels, according to economists who work for the Big Three automakers.
Economists for Ford Motor Co and General Motors Corp both forecast vehicle sales between 15 million and 15.5 million in 1997, while Chrysler Corp's economist predicted sales of 15.2 million. Sales were about 15.4 million in 1996. The forecasts were made in a presentation to the Society of Automotive Analysts.  
""We are likely to see more of the same,"" Chrysler's W. Van Bussmann said, echoing the view of the other two analysts.
""We see no significant changes in either direction on fiscal or monetary policy,"" said G. Mustafa Mohatarem of General Motors.
Ford's Martin Zimmerman was even more optimistic. ""I frankly don't see why this growth can't continue into 1998,"" he said.  
But that does not mean the auto industry has no concerns. The one short-term worry all three economists voiced was the weakening of the yen, which fell to about 117 to the dollar Monday from about 106 a year ago. A weaker yen makes Japanese imports, including automobiles, less expensive in the United States.
That, in turn, makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market, giving Japanese automakers more flexibility in pricing, analysts said.  
But the analysts all expected political or market pressures to cause the yen to stabilize and then strengthen somewhat against the dollar this year.
""We should see the yen start to strengthen,"" Zimmerman said.
Bussmann forecast the yen at 106 to the dollar by the end of 1997.
In western Europe, analysts see continued economic pressure associated with the move to European union in 1999 continuing to weigh on the economy there and keep vehicle sales about flat.  
But Mohatarem argued that there is a possibility for a positive surprise in central Europe, saying Russia could achieve three percent economic growth by 1998.
Mexico was also seen as an area for growth, with that economy recoverying quicker than expected from the recent peso crisis, analysts said.
Meanwhile, Bussmann argued that capacity usage for truck production will remain at about 80 percent through the year 2000 and that truck demand as a percentage of total vehicle market share will continue to rise.
""We see the light truck demand reaching 50 percent (of total vehicle demand) by just past the turn of the century,"" he said.
But other analysts were not as optimistic about demand for light trucks, which generally have higher profit margins than cars.
""I don't think it will reach 50 percent of demand,"" said Thomas Webb, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association.
During his presentation, Webb also said his forecast for 1997 auto sales was on the low end of a range he defined between 14.7 million and 15.1 million autos.

5,"The $9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks, which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations.
""NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape,"" said Michael Ancell, banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. ""Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce.""
St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc., a bank holding company with $18.04 billion in assets, was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen's. Kansas City, Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc., with $9.32 billion in assets, also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest, analysts added.
""It focuses more attention on Mercantile, Commerce and Roosevelt,"" said James Weber, analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $9.33 billion asset-St. Louis based thrift.
""Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile,"" Weber said.
Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment.
Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp., Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp., and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois.
Representatives of First Bank, Norwest, Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions. KeyCorp, contacted by phone, would not comment.    With a presence in nine states and $41 billion in assets,
Boatmen's was the prize in Missouri, where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute.
""Boatmen's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest,"" Weber said.
Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner. But NationsBank's bid, representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen's stock, was large enough to get the deal done.
""I think Boatmen's was shopping itself, and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here, you had to make the bid nobody would beat,"" Ancell said.
But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium. They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen's.
""I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy, but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here, I don't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium,"" said Michael Durante, analyst at McDonald &amp; Co.

5,"McDonnell Douglas Corp. stock tumbled Monday after the Defence Department eliminated the company from the race to build a new generation fighter jet that eventually could be worth $200 billion or more.
The decision was a blow to McDonnell Douglas, the nation's second-largest defence contractor and a long-time leader in fighter jets, and could force it to restructure, seek a merger or become more acquisition-minded, industry analysts said.
The Pentagon on Saturday awarded four-year contracts to Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. to develop prototype fighter jets for the early 21st century for the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and the British Royal Navy.
British and U.S. forces have announced plans to buy 3,000 of the joint strike fighter jets, with initial delivery scheduled for 2008.
With potential export sales of another 2,000 jets and additional funding for development and support, the programme could be worth $200 billion to $500 billion over the coming decades, industry executives said.
McDonnell Douglas stock lost $4.25 to close at $52.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the biggest losers of the day. Boeing rose $1.50 to $93.25 and Lockheed Martin rose $1.875 to $95.625, also on the NYSE.
John Modzelewski, an analyst at PaineWebber, said the decision could force St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to seek acquisitions more aggressively to help build its business, or into a merger with another defence or aerospace company.
""Everything's back on the table,"" Modzelewski said.
In the past year, McDonnell Douglas has been the subject of rumoured talks with Boeing, Rockwell International Corp. and Raytheon Co..
McDonnell Douglas has declined to comment on potential mergers and acquisitions. ""We have said we will look at mergers, acquisitions and partnerships that will grow our business,"" a company spokesman said.
""This will be something of a wakeup call,"" CS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said. ""It's a fairly sharp and dramatic blow to McDonnell Douglas and I would venture to guess one they probably didn't see coming.""
PaineWebber's Modzelewski said, ""Without having the internal growth such as joint strike fighter would give them, they're going to have to grow through acquisition."" That could include Texas Instruments Inc.'s defence electronics business, which is for sale, according to published reports.
McDonnell Douglas Chief Executive Harry Stonecipher said on Saturday the loss was a surprise to the company.
""Certainly in terms of the overall future, 10 years and beyond, it is a significant programme to us,"" Stonecipher said.
But in a statement to employees Monday, Stonecipher noted the company's backlog of aircraft orders to the military at home and abroad and said it was pursuing other orders. The company has a $46 billion order backlog, a spokesman said.
""This decision does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business,"" Stonecipher said.
McDonnell currently builds the Air Force F-15 fighter and the Navy-Marine F-18E/F as well as the C-17 military cargo plane. Both the F-15 and the F-18 are to be replaced by the joint strike fighter in the next century.
PaineWebber's Modzelewski said McDonnell Douglas was likely to participate in the new jet fighter programme as a subcontractor, as politics will force the wealth to be spread.
But despite its key role providing fighter jets for decades, the based company has failed to win a major role in any of the next generation of tactical aircraft.
Already the smallest of the three major commercial jet makers, McDonnell said last month it would not continue to compete against Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie in the market for the biggest commercial jetliners.

5,"Mercury Finance Co. got hit by a lawsuit charging it violated securities laws after the auto-loan company said phony bookkeeping entries had inflated its earnings and that it fired its chief accountant.
The stock, which remained halted on the New York Stock Exchange, has not traded since it closed at $14.875 on Tuesday.
The exchange would not indicate where the stock might open but traders said it was changing hands at $4.25 overseas, which would mean a loss of more than $1.8 billion in market worth for the company, based in suburban Lake Forest, Ill.
One of the officers named in the lawsuit was James Doyle, the former controller who Mercury said has not been seen since last Thursday. In its statement on Wednesday, Mercury said it fired Doyle.
Filed in federal court in Chicago on Wednesday, the lawsuit alleges the company and some senior officers misrepresented or omitted crucial information about Mercury's earnings for the last three years, lawyers who filed the suit said in a statement.
The lawsuit also said Doyle had sold tens of thousands and Chairman John Brincat hundreds of thousands of shares of Mercury stock at inflated prices, netting millions of dollars in illegal profits.
Brincat was not available for comment. A company spokesman declined to comment. Attempts to locate Doyle were not successful.
The finance company said on Wednesday its 1996 earnings would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million and that earnings for the three prior years would also adjusted downward, though not as sharply.
The problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its chief accounting officer, Doyle, the company said.
It also said it was in violation of certain provisions if its loan agreements and that a special committee of directors has been formed to investigate the problems.
Analysts were hesitant to talk about Mercury, saying they did not have much information.
But they did say the company's planned acquisition of Fidelity Acceptance from BankBoston Corp. was unlikely to be completed. The deal, announced on Jan. 10, called for Mercury to issue about $458 million in stock to BankBoston. BankBoston said on Wednesday it was awaiting an audit of Mercury.
""I think the odds are very high that the deal will not go through,"" one analyst said, who asked not to be identified.
Analysts also said Mercury has not been as forthcoming as other consumer finance companies when providing detailed financial information.
Mercury helped pioneer the business of lending to consumers whose credit was less than perfect. It started making loans to people in the military and has grown into one of the country's largest lenders in the used-car market.
""They haven't been quite as open as any others in the industry have been,"" one analyst said.
Two brokerage firms cut ratings on Mercury Thursday.
Gruntal &amp; Co. said it suspended its rating, adding, ""We recommend that holders exit positions as soon as possible.""
Piper Jaffray cut its rating to market performer from buy and in a research report said, ""Our guess is most of the over recognised income came from (Mercury's) insurance subsidiary.""

5,"Aiming to fill Americans' seemingly insatiable desire for sport utility vehicles, Chrysler Corp.  and Ford Motor Co.  both introduced new models of the go-anywhere vehicles Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show.
The plush Lincoln Navigator and the brawny Dodge Durango were introduced a day after General Motors Corp.'s unit unveiled an upscale version of its popular Yukon sport/utility vehicle and Subaru of America Inc., a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd  7270T, debuted a new sport/utility based on a passenger car chassis.
Sport/utility vehicles sales climbed to just over two million in the United States in 1996 and are the fastest-growing automotive segment.
The vehicles are so popular that even sportscar maker Porsche AG said Tuesday it also plans to enter the market by the turn of the century.
Although more and more companies are adding more and more models, the market is yet to be saturated, as more drivers foresake cars for the larger vehicles.
""They really are considered substitutes,"" said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist at First Chicago NBD Corp. ""These are replacing old station wagons. They're also eating very heavily into the luxury car markets.""
Luxury is a key feature of the new Ford and GM models.
Ford's Lincoln Navigator, which is expected to be available in July, includes leather seating surfaces, walnut wood accents and second row bucket seats.
It is expected to be priced in the mid-$40,000 range and will compete at the premium end of the market with vehicles by Lexus and Land Rover. It is aimed at affluent empty nesters or high-profile active families. The target age for Navigator owners is 45-55, said Jim O'Connor, general manager of Ford's Lincoln Mercury division.
The vehicle, which O'Connor expects will sell 20,000 annually, was driven through a mock rock wall and waterfall to make its debut.
The vehicle seats eight, has a 5.4-litre V8 engine with 8,000 pound towing capacity and 116.4 cubic feet of cargo space.
GMC's Yukon Denali, which is scheduled to be in production in  the 1998 calendar year, features four heated seats and a premium sound system, among other accessories.
""We're certainly going upscale,"" Roy Roberts, general manager of GM's Pontiac-GMC division, said when asked about pricing. He declined to comment further.
Chrysler made its typical auto show splash with the introduction of the Dodge Durango, which broke through the floor of a mock-up of the automaker's new headquarters building.
Touting it as a breakthrough vehicle that offers ""more of everything,"" Chrysler said sales could eventually reach 200,000 units. The automaker invested $910 million to bring the vehicle to market.
The Durango, which goes on sale in December, uses the same chassis and beefy front end as the Dodge Dakota pickup truck. It is aimed at a more downscale audience than Chrysler's tony Jeep Grand Cherokee. One unique feature is a rear cargo well sized to fit a hunting rifle.
The vehicle is bigger than Ford's popular Explorer, but smaller than the Yukon, Navigator and Ford Expedition.
Durango features an optional third bench seat, boosting its seating capacity up to eight people.
Despite growing criticism about sport/utilities' poor fuel economy, the Durango offers the biggest engines in its class, including 5.2-litre and 5.9-litre V8s.
Pricing was not announced, but Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz said the Durango could be made with a four-cylinder engine, if necessary.
With so many new sport/utility vehicles entering the market, it is becoming more competitive, which will eventually lead to pressure on margins.
""We'll get saturation if people can't afford to buy these things, relative to the cars they drive,"" said Joseph Phillippi, analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Demand for more affordable sport/utilities will push manufacturers to build them on car platforms, as Subaru, Toyota and Honda are doing, Phillippi said, adding that few drivers travel far off road and don't need the ruggedness and high ground clearance of a truck-based sport/utility.
Executives at the Big Three automakers stress that their new sport/utility vehicles will not compete with existing lines.
""We don't think this will be a major drag at all on Expedition,"" O'Connor said of Ford's current top-of-the-line sport utility vehicle. Instead, he said the Navigator should attract new customers to Lincoln-Mercury.
""I think it will bring a whole new customer to Lincoln,"" he said.
But the automakers also know that if they don't offer sport/utility vehicles in a variety of niches, others will.
""I'd rather have the alternative be in my dealer"" showroom, said Chrysler's Lutz.
As for Porsche, Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking would not go into specifics on the German automaker's plans in the sector, other than to say it was in discussions with a third party.
"
5,"Caterpillar Inc chief financial officer Douglas Oberhelman said Tuesday that an increase in U.S. dealer new machine inventories at the end of 1996 was intentional.
""It's higher than it was a year ago and that's by design,"" Olberhelman said in an interview with Reuters. ""As it turned out last year, we didn't have enough inventory in dealer hands and this year we will, we hope,"" he said.
Some analysts expressed concern Tuesday at the increase in inventories.  
The Peoria, Illinois-based heavy equipment maker Tuesday reported record net income of $381 million or $1.99 a share for the fourth quarter, up from $300 million or $1.53 a share a year ago and $0.11 ahead of consensus estimates.
But the company's outlook that the 1997 profit level would ""approximate"" that of 1996 appeared to be pushing the stock lower Tuesday.
Oberhelman defended the company's view of slowing U.S. economic growth in the face of analysts' comments that the view was too conservative.  
""We're trying to call it as we see it,"" he said. ""I will tell you that a year ago, we called for a softer economy in the U.S. and it didn't happen. We were pleasantly surprised.""
He added that the company is prepared to increase production if demand is stronger than expected, as it did in 1996.
After focusing the last several years on improving operations, Oberhelman said the company now thinks it's time to increase spending on research and development and on capital assets to improve shareholder value in the future.  
Total capital expenditures were $642 million in 1996 and are expected to rise 10 to 15 percent in 1997, while research and development is expected to rise 20 percent from the $410 million spent in 1996, Caterpillar said.
""It's going to be a little bit of everything,"" he said when asked if the expenditures would be focused on acquisition or internal development.
He said the company is likely to continue its pace of about 50 new or upgraded product introductions a year through 1999.
One area the company is looking to gain in is power generation equipment, a $5 billion worldwide market Caterpillar sees tripling in the next several years.
""We'll still be building there, both internally and through acquisitions,"" he said.
Caterpillar shares were down 1-3/4 at 76-3/4 Tuesday.

5,"Mercantile Bancorp Inc would likely remain a potential target in the Missouri bank merger wave after its planned combination with Mark Twain Bancshares Inc.
""This certainly doesn't mean that Mercantile is no longer a buyout candidate,"" said Michael Ancell, analyst at Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. ""It's clear that the bank merger wave has rolled into St. Louis and it's turning into a tsunami.""  
As the largest bank holding company in Missouri behind Boatmen's Bancshares Inc, Mercantile is seen by analysts as attractive to banks looking to establish a presence in the lower Midwest.
In August, NationsBank Corp agreed to buy Boatmen's Bancshares Inc for $9.5 billion.
That deal valued Boatmen's at a pricey 2.7 times book value, analysts said. Mercantile's deal values Mark Twain at about 2.8 times book value, analysts said. The pooling of interests deal is worth $49.62 a share to Mark Twain shareholders, based on Friday's closing price, the banks said.  
The St. Louis-based bank holding companies would have a combined total of $21.3 billion in assets.
""It's a pretty pricey transaction,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp. ""Mark Twain is a very profitable and a very attractive franchise.""
Mark Twain reported return on average assets of 1.82 percent in the third quarter and return on average realized common equity of 18.49 percent, putting it in the upper echelon of Midwest banks, analysts said.  
""It's an in-market deal, which allows for a tremendous ammount of efficiencies, which is good for Mercantile,"" said Joseph Steiven, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ""They're paying full-boat prices, but they're getting an excellent company.""
But Schutz noted that Mark Twain already operates efficiently, and questioned how much more in efficiency Mercantile could wring out of Mark Twain.
""The question I would ask is how is Mercantile going to earn back this premium they're paying,"" Schutz said.  
That question appeared to be in the market Monday, with Mercantile shares down 2-3/8 at 49-3/4 and Mark Twain up 3-5/8 to 46.
Mark Twain chief executive John Dubinsky, who is slated to become chief executive of Mercantile's St. Louis bank when the deal is completed, indicated there were not likely to be wholesale job cuts when the two banks combine.
""Between Mercantile and Mark Twain as we sit here today, there are over 200 job openings,"" Dubinsky said in an interview. ""There will be some duplications, there will be some consolidation of job functions.""
But ""quality"" individuals whose jobs are eliminated because of duplication will be able to apply for other jobs, he said, noting ""I would be very surprised if there was a large number of individuals that won't be needed.""
Dubinsky also would not rule out the possibility of the combined Mercantile/Mark Twain being acquired.
""Banking is changing so rapidly,"" he said. ""One couldn't make any comment with certainty about the future.""

5,"Dutch bank ABN AMRO Holding NV said Friday it agreed to pay $1.9 billion to acquire Standard Federal Bancorp, which owns the seventh-largest savings bank in the United States and the biggest in Michigan.
ABN AMRO, which already has a U.S. banking arm, the LaSalle group, said it was offering $59 a share for Standard Federal, a bank holding company with $15.5 billion in assets based in Troy, Mich.
SFB owns Standard Federal Bank, a large home mortgage lender in Michigan that operates about 180 bank branches and 11 home lending centres. It also operates a wholesale mortgage banking business.
Despite the offer, SFB stock fell after running up sharply in recent days on takeover speculation. Some investors were disappointed the price was not higher, analysts said.
""All the people were really speculating yesterday that it was a lot higher are selling today because they're disappointed,"" said Tony Howard, analyst at Olde Discount Corp.
SFB stock lost $1.625 to $56.375 in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Standard Federal chief lending officer Garry Carley said at a news conference that ABN AMRO had made the highest bid for the bank among several serious suitors.
""We had others who expressed strong interest in the bank,"" Carley told reporters.
ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' leading bank, said it would issue $750 million in preferred stock to help fund the acquisition, its biggest to date. It said it would issue the shares through a U.S. subsidiary, ABN AMRO North America Inc.
Formed in a 1990 merger, ABN AMRO already is the biggest foreign bank in the United States. Its LaSalle group has 130 branches and 7,750 staff members, mainly in the Chicago area.
The agreement marks ABN AMRO North America Inc.'s sixth acquisition in three years and is likely to be the last for a while, ABN AMRO North America Chief Executive Officer Harrison Tempest said at a news conference.
""We're out of the acquisition business for some time now,"" Tempest said. When asked how long before it might make another deal, he said, ""probably two years.""
The combined banks will also be the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States, ABN AMRO said.
""It gets us into the league we want to be in mortgage servicing and mortgage origination,"" Tempest said.
SFB employs about 4,000 people and serves 1 million clients in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.
ABN AMRO said Standard Federal's banks will continue to operate under the Standard Federal name and there would be ""significant cost savings"" following the deal.
While saying no jobs would be cut initially, both companies said some job cuts were likely eventually as administrative functions and some branches were consolidated.
With Standard Federal, ABN AMRO North America will have the second largest deposit base in the Chicago market.
Analysts said recent changes in U.S. banking law that will level the playing field between thrifts and banks should help speed other acquisitions of savings and loans.
""I think you're going to see an increased level of activity, both in banks acquiring thrifts and thrifts acquiring thrifts,"" said Jonathon gray, analyst at Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co.
ABN AMRO said it had reached agreement with Standard Federal's board, but the deal still needed the approval of its shareholders and supervisory authorities.
The acquisition was expected to be completed by mid-1997, ABN said, adding that the deal would contribute to its earnings.

26,"She once jokingly thought of calling her autobiography ""Fascist Bitch,"" and now Canadian journalists are wondering what epithet to use as she plays an expanding role in the country's largest newspaper empire.
British-born Barbara Amiel, the wife of Hollinger Inc. chairman Conrad Black, is an accomplished journalist who counts many fans in Britain, where she writes a rightwing shoot-from-the-hip column for the Daily Telegraph, the centerpiece of the Hollinger empire.
Although she honed her craft in Canada, she makes many Canadians bristle by standing out from the mass of generally liberal journalists. She says she has never managed to reap the accolades she desires from Canadians, the ones she routinely receives from the British.
A sought-after London party guest, Amiel now is in the Canadian spotlight through her position as vice president of editorial in her husband's newspaper empire. Hollinger added a majority shareholding in Southam Inc., the country's largest daily newspaper chain, to its media stable, substantially boosting its control to more than 40 percent of the industry.
The move left some Canadians worried about Hollinger's influence on their media and many Southam journalists fearful for their jobs as Black's well-known road to profits often involves cutting newspaper staff.
HUSBAND CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF
At a recent conference of journalists in Ottawa, Amiel, a former Toronto Sun editor, was repeatedly asked about Black's intentions. She replied that he could speak for himself. But she added, ""I think the Southam papers ... have not done their best but have terrific potential.""
Amiel, who still writes for Maclean's magazine, hesitated when asked if she was treated differently in Canada than abroad. ""I think Canada's been very good to me. I became editor of a newspaper, (former editor) Peter Newman gave me a column in Maclean's magazine, how many people have got that? You can't complain.""
But then she added, ""I've never, although one always wants it, had the recognition of my peers that I've had in England, but then maybe I didn't deserve it in Canada.""
Television personality Alan Edmonds, an admirer of Amiel who disagrees with her views, said Canadians have refrained from praising Amiel's talents because of her rightwing bias. ""In the years that she was in Canada ... the prevailing mindset in the media was in the opposite direction.""
Edmonds said other journalists were jealous of the openings that came her way. ""She's used her undoubted feminine attraction to ... create opportunities to use her undoubted superior intellect.""
In person and in print, Amiel has a knack for sparking debates. For instance, she once wrote that Quebec's moves toward independence, culminating in a narrow 1995 defeat for the separatists, could be blamed on Canada's liberal elite, which promoted multi-culturalism, thereby strengthening French-Canadian nationalism.
CASTIGATING LEFTWINGERS
Her columns have castigated Ontario's former leftwing government, led by the New Democratic Party, for allegedly being swayed by special interest groups like the disabled. She also wrote that Ontario, which gave homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual ones, had weakened the family.
Canada's most widely read satirical magazine, Frank, noted ""a favorite theme in her columns is the insidiousness of self-pity, that the poor should get on with their lives and quit carping about it."" And columnist Allan Fotheringham once observed, ""Barbara Amiel, otherwise known as Mrs. Conrad Black, can take out any opponent in the world and eat them for breakfast. As she does regularly in print.""
Amiel has even joked about her reputation, saying she thought about calling her surprisingly frank 1980 autobiography ""Fascist Bitch,"" a name suggested by irate readers. Instead the book was titled ""Confessions.""
Now in her mid-50s, the much-married Amiel began her path at the tender age of eight at a ""grotty little newspaper"" in her hometown of Hendon, England. Her parents divorced, her mother remarried and her new Canadian stepfather dragged his new family back home. Amiel, used to fine surroundings, ended up in Hamilton, a gritty steel town in southern Ontario about 40 miles (70 km) from Toronto.
Before her 1991 marriage to Black, she was married to student Gary Smith, philosopher George Jonas and cable magnate David Graham, with whom she returned to England in 1985.
In 1993 well-known Canadian author Margaret Atwood published ""The Robber Bride"" about a scapel-assisted femme fatale named Zenia. The Canadian rumor mill identified Amiel as the model for Zenia, but she denied it.

26,"This year's rally at the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest equity market, will stretch through 1997 and may last until the turn of the century, analysts forecast.
""I think the Toronto Stock Exchange is in the middle of a bull market,"" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist with Oppenheimer &amp; Co Inc in New York.
Canadian equities investors have enjoyed spectacular gains this year. Toronto's key 300 Composite Index jumped as much as 28 percent in 1996 and was now up 21 percent after a correction this month.
By contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which Toronto generally tracks, was up 23 percent this year, down from a peak of 26 percent.
Analysts said Toronto's market -- the 10th most active worldwide -- would continue to benefit from poor bond yields, which make stocks more attractive.
Bond yields have dropped across the board this year, with 50 basis points shaved off the return of Canada's 30-year benchmark bonds.
Most of the seven analysts polled by Reuters said Toronto's 300 index next year would break its all-time high of 6018 points, set on November 28. The index was at about 5700 on Friday.
Analysts' median estimate for the 300 index was 6600 points by the end of 1997, rising to 7600 by 1998's close.
""We're in a general long-term uptrend,"" said Katherine Beattie, technical analyst for MMS International in Toronto. ""The stock market is still going to be the best place to invest given the relatively low interest rates.""
""We will start inching up, but even if we do get two or three interest rate hikes in the first couple of quarters next year - which I think is going to cause a correction in the markets - it's not going to put bonds or bills at a competitive enough level,"" Beattie said.
Fred Ketchen, senior vice-president at brokerage ScotiaMcLeod Inc, said Canadian equities were being snapped up by the large baby boom population, which was now focusing on generating wealth for retirement amid the uncertain future of government pensions.
""I think that basically we're into fairly firm markets right through until the end of the century,"" Ketchen said. ""Demographics are certainly helping here.""
Josef Schachter, president of Schachter Asset Management Inc, predicted Toronto's heavily weighted resource sectors could push the 300 index to 7000 by the end of 1997 and to at least 8500 a year later.
""I see (it) potentially higher than that if we can get precious metals...and base metals joining the party,"" Schachter said.
Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels forecast th index would climb to 8000 by the end of 1998 and 10000 by the year 2000.
But some analysts were more bearish, with John Ing, president of Toronto-based Maison Placements Canada Inc, predicting the index would sink to 5750 by the end of 1997 and 5400 by the end of 1998.
Ing said interest rate hikes would cut short the party.
""The inevitable increase in rates has got to happen sometime within the next 12 months and that will test the markets,"" Ing said.
"
26,"Canada's largest stock exchange's key index broke through the psychological barrier of 5500 points on Monday to a new closing high of 5518 points.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 25.5 points to hit 5518 points by day's end, propelled by soaring gold issues and surging oil stocks.
The 300 Index reached 5000 points on Feb. 1.
Today, ""we have gone through the 5500 barrier,"" noted ScotiaMcLeod's senior vice-president Fred Ketchen.
Another trader said: ""There seems... to be foreign interest in Canada.""
Overseas investors are eyeing Canada's falling interest rates and declining deficit financing needs, analysts said.
Trading volume totalled 858 million shares valued at C$1.25 billion (US$929 million).
Advancing issues beat out declining ones 561 to 420, while 276 traded unchanged.
Nine of Toronto's 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by the heavily weighted gold sector, which rose 1.2 percent, and the oil group which jumped 1.7 percent, along with stronger base metals and media issues.
Falling groups included consumer products, conglomerates and forestry products.
Among Toronto's hot stocks were fertilizer firms. Viridian Inc. said it agreed to a friendly C$1.33 billion (US$988 million) merger with Agrium Inc.
Viridian shares jumped C$1.25 to C$17.75 on more than 4.1 million shares, while Agrium lost C$0.35 to hit C$18.55 in heavy dealings. The merger would create one of North America's largest integrated fertilizer firms.
Nickel giant Inco Ltd. jumped C$1.05 to C$41.80 in heavy trading, after it announced higher-than-expected third quarter earnings at US$0.19 a share compared to year-earlier US$0.33 a share.
Stampeder Exploration Ltd topped Toronto's most active stocks, rising C$0.10 to reach C$6.55.
"
26,"Lower profits from base metals producers are clouding the otherwise improving corporate earnings picture for Canadian companies in the third quarter, analysts said.
Richardson Greenshields of Canada analyst Dunnery Best forecast ""very substantial declines in earnings"" for major base metal firms.
""I think almost everywhere else you're going to see improvements year-over-year,"" Best said.  
Canada's third-quarter earnings season kicks off when Alcan Aluminium Ltd reports on Thursday.
Best said he expected Alcan third-quarter earnings to fall to US$0.35 a share from year earlier US$0.61 a share, which came before an extraordinary loss of US$1.24 a share for an asset writedown.
""There's some concerns that the metal group may not exactly report the (expected) numbers,"" Griffiths McBurney analyst Greg Misztela said.  
Companies such as Inco Ltd, Noranda Inc and Falconbridge Ltd would likely see earnings declines, Best said. A likely exception was Teck Corp, which Best said ""has a lot of coal in its production lineup and coal's been strong, so that will be the one offset.""
Investors had anticipated disappointments, causing metal stock prices to slide after second-quarter earnings were hit by a drop in copper, nickel and other prices.  
Markets were rocked in mid-June by the news that Sumitomo Corp fired its head copper trader after he allegedly ran up a US$1.8 billion loss.
Analysts forecast that Canada's major banks would lead the pack in earnings gains. The banks are expected to report their results for the fourth quarter ended October 31 in early December.
""They'll have a very good year-over-year comparison. I think quarter-over-quarter won't be quite as good,"" said Royal Bank of Canada vice-president of equities John Kellett.  
The six big banks, including Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, have posted a string of record profits in recent years.
Best said Richardson Greenshields had increased earnings estimates for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce six times so far this year.
Consumer products earnings will also rise, analysts said.
Another strong area will be Canada's important gold sector, which was buoyed by firmer bullion prices.
Earnings at energy firms will be fueled by higher crude oil prices, analysts said.  
Retail firms will benefit from recent cuts in short-term interest rates by Canada's central bank, spurring consumers to borrow and shop. ""Bit by bit the underpinnings are being put in place for a more confident consumer that would eventually lead to better times,"" Kellett said.
Some high-technology firms have said they would report losses in the upcoming quarter, including Gandalf Technologies Inc and Corel Corp, due to problems getting their products to market.  
Technology heavyweights such as Northern Telecom Ltd and Newbridge Networks Corp will see higher earnings, Best said.

26,"Toronto stocks ended firmer in brisk dealings on Friday, adding another 10 points to the week's gains of 90 points and bringing the key 300 index closer to breaking its all-time high.
""We just refuse to move lower,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. ""We're just ignoring all the bad news."" The Toronto Stock Exchange key 300 Composite Index rose 10.9 points to end at 5193.0 points on Friday.
The TSE 300 has recovered from its lows in July and is climbing towards its all-time high of 5248.37 points reached in late May.
The index may test the high next week, Beattie said.
On Thursday Canada's central bank cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points, easing the key bank rate to 4.25 percent. This will help keep up interest in Toronto's important bank issues, analysts have said.
During the week, investors picked up the heavily weighted gold stocks as gold prices edged closer to the psychological high of US$400 on New York's COMEX, analysts have said.
Canadian forestry products were hot today with U.S. market players as well, said ScotiaMcLeod's director of investment research Jim Doak.
Nine of Toronto's 14 sub-indices rose, led by golds, forestry products, base metals and transports. Falling sectors included media issues, oils and utilities.
Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones 481 to 371, while 310 traded flat.
Golds were among the most actively traded issues. Meridian Gold Inc. led the pack, rising C0.30 to C$6.20 on more than two million shares. It topped Toronto's most actives list.
Forestry products firm MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. gained C0.30 to C$20.00 in heavy trading.
Fertilizer firm Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. rose C$2.00 to C$106.00 on strong turnover.
"
26,"The Toronto Stock Exchange snapped a seven-session winning streak to close softer on Monday, depressed by weak gold stocks.
The TSE's key 300 Composite Index lost 24.90 points to end at 6113.90 points, in turnover of 104 million shares worth C$1.58 billion.
""We had a really nice seven-day rally,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. ""You're bound to have some kind of correction.""
Gold bullion prices tumbled today in both London and New York, pushing Toronto's heavily weighted gold stocks into weaker territory. Some U.S. traders were off for the U.S. Martin Luther King holiday.
Despite weaker golds, Toronto stocks did not fall that far. ""Actually we didn't have such a bad day today,"" said Maison Placements Canada president John Ing.
Investors are nervously awaiting comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday, Beattie said. ""The market's on edge.
Greenspan is scheduled to testify on the state of the economy to a Senate Budget committee hearing starting at 1000 EST/1500 GMT.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices lost ground except for oil and gas. The weak side was led by a 1.7 percent drop in golds, followed by media, transportation and forestry products.
Declining issues outnumbered advances 528 to 474, with 291 stocks unchanged.
Gold stocks were active today. Bre-X Mineral Ltd. fell 1.40 to 23.00 on over 1.8 million shares. Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana earlier today gave Bre-X and potential partner Barrick Gold Corp. one month to settle with their local partners in the huge Busang gold find.
Barrick's shares dipped 0.75 to 36.10.
Golden Rule Resources Ltd. closed up 0.95 to 9.35 after earlier hitting a 52-week high of 9.65.
Oil firm Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. rose 0.30 to 25.60, topping Toronto's most active list on volume of nearly four million shares.
"
26,"The Toronto Stock Exchange's key index ended higher on Wednesday, but the overall market finished mixed in thin trading as many money managers decided to place their bets on fixed income investments.
The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 24.57 points to close at 6071.28 in turnover of 105.3 million shares worth C$1.4 billion ($1.04 billion).
Almost all of Toronto's 14 sub-indices ended higher except transportation. Despite these gains, declining stocks outpaced advances 492 to 483 with 281 issues unchanged.
""I think the market's kind of jittery,"" said Oppenheimer &amp; Co Inc chief strategist Michael Metz.
ScotiaMcLeod's director of investment research Jim Doak agreed. ""People are being cagey, not going to equity funds,"" he said.
Many mutual fund managers are trading cautiously and awaiting direction in the market after this week's volatility, analysts said.
New York soared 84.7 points to close at 6740.7 following yesterday's roller-coaster ride in North American markets.
Media, consumer products, golds and real estate posted the strongest gains among Toronto's rising sectors.
Smaller issues, including some heavyweight gold stocks, we're sold off in thin trading, one trader said.
Golden Rule Resources Ltd. lost 2.70 to 10.05 on more than three million shares. Brokerage firm ScotiaMcLeod recommended selling the prospector after shares nearly tripled since January 6 on initial results from its Ghana property.
Bre-X Minerals Ltd. slipped 0.05 to 21.65 while potential partner Barrick Gold Corp. rose 0.20 to 37.05. Both denied an earlier report which said Bre-X may be able to hold an auction for control over its huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia.
Shares in Placer Dome Inc., Barrick's possible rival, rose 0.70 to close at 28.60.
"
26,"Toronto stocks ended weaker in light trading on Thursday, swept lower by a downdraft in the oil and gas sector.
Toronto's key 300 Composite Index fell 40.52 points to 6071.89. Trading was lackluster at 107.3 million shares worth C$1.4 billion ($1.04 billion).
""Toronto committed suicide,"" said portfolio manager Josef Schachter. ""The oils and golds ... got clipped and took the market lower,"" he said.
Oils took a beating after March Nymex oil lost US$0.81 today to close at US$23.10 a barrel. The TSE's energy group surrendered 172 points, leading 11 of 14 sub-groups lower.
The heavyweight gold sector also fell along with softer bullion prices in New York. Comex April gold lost US$1.30 to close at US$345.10 an ounce.
The three strong sectors were real estate, transportation and retailing.
Declining stocks edged out advances 545 to 402 while 276 issues were unchanged.
Schachter said he expected the downdraft to continue for the next few sessions, pulling the Canadian market down by another 100 points. However, oil stocks may bounce back if the rest of the North American winter remains cold and demand for energy improves.
Among active stocks, oil producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. fell 1.95 to close at 34.25 on 2.6 million shares.
Food services firm Cara Operations Ltd. topped Toronto's most-active list. Its class A stock gained 0.35 to close at 4.10 on 6.6 million shares after reporting stronger third quarter earnings.
Among active golds, Barrick Gold Corp. fell 0.60 to close at 35.25 on 1.7 million shares.
"
26,"Toronto stocks ended softer on Thursday, snapping a recent winning streak despite strength in the gold and real estate sectors.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index slipped by 10.69 points to reach 5739.23 points, after adding more than 1.5 percent yesterday.
""After yesterday's remarkable action, it's time for a pause,"" said RBC Dominion Securities analyst Dunnery Best in a report.
""The golds have ignited on the quick rise in bullion prices that came late morning,"" Best said.
COMEX December gold ended up US$0.90 at US$379.60 an ounce, after hitting a six-day intraday high at US$382.00. The yellow metal soared briefly after comments by a Japanese official which indicated Japan will no longer tolerate a weak yen.
This pushed the U.S. dollar lower while investors rushed to sell the currency and buy gold, but the dollar recovered after the U.S. government had a strong 30-year Treasury bond auction, said Maison Placements Canada trader Rolie Bradley.
Toronto trading was brisk at 99.8 million shares worth C$1.7 billion (US$1.28 billion). Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones 522 to 488 and 289 traded flat.
Half of Toronto's 14 sub-indices eased, led by pipeline stocks, banks and consumer products. Golds, conglomerates and real estate issues rolled higher.
""The lower interest rates are really stimulating the whole real estate situation,"" Bradley said.
Among hot stocks were the banks, which sank after a month's worth of gains. Royal Bank of Canada topped Toronto's most active stocks, falling C$0.90 to C$47.90 on nearly 2.7 million shares.
""Our favourite group, the banks, which got a pasting today, likely will go up tomorrow,"" Bradley said.
Telecommunications firm Northern Telecom Ltd. lost C$2.55 to reach C$86.95 in heavy trading. It said on Thursday that it agreed to buy the assets of a California-based software firm, AGL Systmes Inc., for an undisclosed sum.
Funeral homes operator Loewen Group Inc. slipped C$0.75 to C$51.75 in light dealings. The closely watched firm, which has made headlines for its battle against hostile bidder Service Corp. International, said it expects to make acquisitions worth US$600-US$700 million next year.
"
26,"The Toronto Stock Exchange's key index set records for a second straight session on Wednesday, achieving new closing and intra-day highs.
The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 10.48 points to end at 6065.34, after earlier setting an intra-day high of 6080.15.
Trading was brisk with 114.6 million shares changing hands worth C$1.7 billion ($1.27 billion).
A rally in Canada's currency boosted investor interest in equities. ""It is encouraging that we're up despite the 35-point drop in the Dow,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
The dollar strengthened by more than a full Canadian cent, ending at C$1.3413 (US$0.7456) from Tuesday's close of C$1.3519 (US$0.7397) and propelled the TSE to its second record close of 1997.
A bullish article on Canada in Britain's Financial Times newspaper sparked the rally, a dollar trader said.
Toronto posted gains in all but three of its 14 sub-indices -- forestry products, real estate and industrial products. The strong side was led by base metals, pipelines, banks and transports.
Advancing stocks outpaced declines 508 to 466, with 294 flat.
Small gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. was among the hotly traded stocks. Bre-X rose 1.10 to 24.45 on 2.2 million shares after Tuesday's announcement that Placer Dome Inc. offered a deal to share in the huge Busang gold deposit.
Placer finished flat at 28.10 while shares in Barrick Gold Corp., which is also negotiating a deal with Bre-X, dipped 0.40 to 35.05.
Investors shrugged off news that Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh had filed a C$2 billion ($1.49 billion) lawsuit in Canada against Bre-X, claiming part ownership of Busang.
Repap Enterprises Inc. fell 0.47 to 2.90 on doubts that its Avenor Inc. takeover would proceed.
Telecommunications firm Mitel Corp. jumped 0.90 to a new closing high of 10.10 after an analyst upgraded Mitel to buy from market perform and raised his 12-month target to 14 from 11.
Copper giant Rio Algom Ltd. fell 2.00 to 31.90 on 1.5 million shares after some investors decided to buy into a newly announced convertible debenture issue.

49,"Two years ago, China's second telephone network set out to challenge the powerful Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and bring competition into the country's a fast-growing market.
But the fledgling network has found it hard to tackle a seasoned competitor -- one that is also the market regulator.
""Are they (the MPT) supposed to be the referee or one of the athletes on the playing field?"" asks Li Huifen, president of China United Telecommunications Corp, also known as Unicom.
The arrival of Unicom and the end of the MPT monopoly was initially hailed as a boost for China's long-suffering telephone subscribers, who often had to wait up to a year for a telephone line and endure indifferent service afterwards.
But Unicom has captured only a tiny slice of the market as its entrenched competitor has kept a tight grip on the telecommunications sector, using its regulatory clout to slow the upstart network's advance.
""They have delayed interconnections and won't give us telephone numbers for our customers,"" Li said in an interview. ""We need a telecommunications law to give us a legal framework.""
Unicom has 16 shareholders, but the key backers of the project were the ministries of electronics industry (MEI), power and railways.
MANUFACTURING MUSCLE
The MEI has manufacturing muscle with a corps of factories producing telecommunications equipment. But it feared the MPT's equipment-making capacity would eventually squeeze it out of the market unless it had its own captive customers.
The other key partners had private telecommunications networks with spare capacity, while the MPT's public network was heavily overcrowded.
The feud between the rival Chinese government camps was often bitter, sometimes ensnaring foreign companies. Firms that did business with the new network were threatened with blacklisting by the MPT, according to Western industry sources.
Those frictions have eased somewhat in recent months, but it still took an order from the State Council, or cabinet, for promised network interconnections to emerge.
China expects to have more than 60 million telephone lines installed by the end of this year -- adding a breathtaking 10 million in 1996 alone. The total is likely to top 100 million by the turn of the century, still only a small segment of the nation's 1.2 billion people.
MPT says it should not be considered a competitor to Unicom because it has a separate operating arm called China Telecom.
""Since 1993, we have separated policy making from business operations by creating China Telecom,"" said an MPT spokesman. ""The MPT is not both regulating and competing,"" he said, blaming Unicom's slow progress on its own technical problems.
STRUGGLE TO BE IMPARTIAL
But China Telecom officials concede it is hard to say where one entity ends and the other begins. And even if they can draw the line cleanly, the MPT must struggle to remain impartial.
""They always say they are being fair,"" said Unicom's Li. ""But China Telecom is their own child, and parents are always partial to their own children.""
Li took up the Unicom reins in August, becoming the third president in the company's brief history. She was tapped from her job as deputy mayor of the big industrial city of Tianjin to put political clout behind the second network.
The company started with mobile telephone services, first in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, and eventually expanded to 16 cities. It has made its greatest inroads in Shanghai where it has about 20,000 mobile phone customers, Li said.
""In 10 years we will have 10 percent of the fixed line market and 30 percent of the mobile phone market,"" Li said.
One clear success has been in bringing mobile telephone prices down. They now cost 7,000 to 10,000 yuan ($840 - $1,200) compared with 10,000 to 20,000 yuan before Unicom came along.
Li says Unicom is profitable on its operations, but that excludes heavy investments in building network infrastructure. Despite the cost of putting a network in place, Unicom has one advantage. Foreigners are not permitted to operate telecommunications networks in China, and many foreign firms give Unicom capital in return for a share of the income.
That will at least ease the growing pains for the infant network, analysts said.
"
49,"China said Monday it expected talks with the United States soon on a dispute over U.S. sanctions on its textiles and its own threat to retaliate.
Beijing also said it was still too soon to say which U.S. imports would be banned if Washington failed to withdraw penalties on imported Chinese textiles.
""We expect to see working level talks with the U.S. in the near future,"" an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation told Reuters. ""The two sides will exchange views,"" he said.
Beijing said Sunday it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods, animal husbandry products, fruits and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.
The temporary import ban is to take effect on Dec. 10.
In September, Washington announced punitive charges against import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using shipments through other countries to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.
China said the action was taken without consultation and with no clear supporting evidence, adding that it had no choice but to impose retaliatory sanctions.
""We are still seeking the views of Chinese enterprises about which products should be included under the ban,"" the Chinese official said. ""That will be determined in another 30 days.""
The total of trade affected by Washington's action was estimated at $19 million -- only a fraction of Sino-U.S. trade, which is now heavily in China's favour. The United States says its trade deficit with China last year was more than $35 billion.
China's threatened trade ban, made ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meant yet another face-off in the frequently testy Sino-U.S. ties.
Relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues, from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.
China and the United States have said they saw an improvement in relations since they narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival Taiwan earlier this year.
The two sides are preparing for high-level exchanges next year, including a possible visit to China by Vice President Al Gore and a summit between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton.
Christopher's visit was expected to pave the way for these meetings.
"
49,"China's central bank chief has said that inflation would be a modest seven percent this year and this showed the state's economic policies were working.
But Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, lashed out at companies that had taken advantage of tight money policies used to tackle inflation by lending money at excessively high rates.
""The appropriately tight monetary polices have achieved clear results which have been acknowledged both in China and abroad,"" Dai was quoted as saying in the Financial News on Monday.
""We can now control inflation to about seven percent for the full year,"" he said.
China's retail inflation stood at 6.9 percent year-on-year in the first seven months and at 5.9 percent in July alone.
Beijing has said it wanted to keep inflation within 10 percent for 1996, down from 14.8 percent last year and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
But the central bank chief had harsh words for companies that had taken advantage of the tough austerity programme put in place three years ago to deal with the worst days of inflation.
He did not name any of the offenders but he said that some ""monopoly groups"" and publicly listed companies were lending out money at excessively high rates.
Tsingtao Brewery, which has stock listed in Hong Kong as well as in Shanghai, has run afoul of regulatory authorities in the British colony in the past for lending out funds raised from its public offer.
A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named said several big ministries were cash-rich and able to earn more than bank deposit rates by lending out their funds.
""The big offenders are some cash-rich ministries,"" said the economist. ""They can earn 16-18 percent on their money.""
That would compare with interest of 7.47 percent earned on one-year bank deposits.
Other economists have said that higher rates were available for even more speculative lending.
Dai gave no indication of whether any measures were being planned to address these problems, although he said that funds in the banking system were unevenly distributed.
He said that China had already taken steps to curb illegal money market trade and that it had taken steps to ensure that other unauthorised financial organisations did not act as commercial banks.
""There are many violations of financial regulations,"" Dai was quoted as saying. ""There must be an expansion of supervision over the financial sector.""
"
49,"China gave new hints on Monday that its three-year austerity programme was over, pronouncing its anti-inflation fight a success and saying the new task was ensuring stability as the nation prepared to recover Hong Kong.
China's top leaders, after winding up four days of meetings on the economy, also said a key goal next year was to speed reform of ailing state enterprises.
""After three years of strenuous efforts, our national economy has had sustained, rapid and healthy development. The main task of keeping inflation under control has been achieved,"" the official Economic Daily said in its report on the meeting.
""Next year is an important one in our history as it marks the recovery of Hong Kong and the year of the 15th Communist Party congress,"" the official People's Daily said in a commentary that also called for economic progress in the midst of stability.
China slapped tight controls on government spending in 1993 to keep mounting inflation in check.
The credit curbs are likely to bring inflation below 6.5 percent this year, compared with 14.8 percent last year and a Communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
The fall in inflation has allowed China to cut interest rates twice this year.
Many economists have been expecting a further easing of monetary policies in the coming months as China is expecting a smooth handover of Hong Kong and social stability ahead of the key policy meeting of the Communist Party.
The British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997 and political planners in Beijing have been eager to ensure that there are no social or economic dislocations in the territory or on the China mainland to mar the transfer of power.
The party congress, scheduled for the second half of next year, is widely expected to result in an infusion of cash into the economy to bolster the standing of the current leadership as party personnel matters come up for discussion.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson recently forecast credit expansion of 20 to 25 percent next year, compared with 17 percent this year.
""Naturally there will be some easing (of monetary policy) next year,"" said Cheng Xiusheng, an economist with the Development Research Centre under the State Council, or cabinet.
He added that the monetary easing would be limited, and would not trigger a new round of inflation.
""The focus is relatively quick economic development under the premise of stability,"" he said.
Other economists agreed there would not be a return to higher inflation.
""If we have an adjustment, it will be a small one,"" said Zhang Zhuoyuan, director of the economics institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
He added that reform of state-owned enterprises was still the key problem facing China's economic planners.
State-owned enterprises have been losing money and massive subsidies have been draining state resources.
Political leaders fear that cutting off these subsidies would lead to layoffs and social unrest though economists have said the strength of the economy gives planners a chance to tackle this problem now.
"
49,"China on Tuesday announced a ban on poultry and poultry products from two U.S. states hit by an outbreak of a deadly disease.
The ban is already in effect and covers poultry from the states of Missouri and Oklahoma, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture told Reuters by telephone.
It was aimed at preventing damage from a ""very destructive disease"", the ministry official said.
The official said, however, that China had banned all U.S. poultry brought into the country either by mail or hand-carried by travellers.
""Travellers are barred from bringing in any poultry goods from the United States,"" he said. ""These products also cannot be brought into China through the mail.""
An official of the State Bureau of Animal Plant and Quarantine said the ban went into effect on Monday.
Official news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two states because of five cases of a deadly poultry flu discovered between July and September.
The quarantine official told Reuters that the action was unrelated to other trade disputes with the United States and there was no plan to delay implementation of the decision.
The virus in question, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, is deadly, Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, told Reuters on Tuesday.
""It's a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases,"" he said. ""The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die.""
But Holloway said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.
The last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state's entire poultry population, he said.
Beijing and Washington are also at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector.
China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.
On Sunday, Beijing announced it was delaying for one month implementation of those restrictions, which had been scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.
In October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears the meat carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
China and the United States held talks averting the ban, worth nearly $500 million a year.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes transshipped through Hong Kong and were worth $445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Every day 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China, according to the council.

49,"Officials with Volkswagen-First Automotive Works in northeastern China on Monday dismissed a report that the joint venture faced possible closure.
""This report is incorrect,"" said a spokeswoman of the joint venture, referring to a report by the German news magazine Der Spiegel.
""Production is still continuing,"" she said in a telephone interview from Changchun.
""We have a 25-year agreement. If the German side withdrew unilaterally, they would have to pay compensation,"" she said. She added that the two sides would soon hold a ceremony marking the full implementation of the joint venture project.
A spokesman for Volkswagen AG's Volkswagen Asia-Pacific arm in Hong Kong also said production at the joint venture would continue.
""There is no reason to leave Changchun,"" he said.
Der Spiegel said the Changchun plant was losing money and production of the Jetta car had practically ceased.
The Hong Kong-based official said the factory had produced 14,700 Jetta cars in the first eight months of this year, up 10 percent from a year ago.
The Jetta was not selling as well as the Volkswagen Santana produced at Volkswagen's Shanghai joint venture, but that operation had taken the lion's share of the domestic passenger car market, he said.
However, some changes in the joint venture agreement were being negotiated, including the introduction of new car models as well as the possibility of Volkswagen taking over sales and after-sales service, the official added.
First Automotive Works had been producing Audi 100s at its own production line in Changchun under a seven-year licensing agreement that expired in June. The Audi 200 was now being built at the joint venture, and 400 have been produced since June.
A total of 7,445 Audi 100s were built from January to June this year, the Volkswagen official said.
First Automotive has also sold 4,120 of its Red Flag cars, an Audi-based car that the Chinese company produces separately from the joint venture using a Chrysler Corp engine, according to Volkswagen.

49,"China is preparing to tap overseas capital markets by listing shares of one or two of its chemical companies abroad, a senior Chinese official was quoted as saying on Sunday.
But as Beijing looks for foreign capital to upgrade its technology it plans to tighten foreign access to its own chemicals market by adding new restrictions on joint ventures.
Chemical Industry Minister Gu Xiulian told the Business Weekly that one or two chemical companies were getting ready for share offerings abroad, though she did not name the companies or the exchanges.
She also said that one or two Chinese companies would issue convertible bonds -- bonds convertible into stock -- on a trial basis, though regulatory guidelines were not yet in place.
China securities regulators are known to be preparing another batch of companies for share offers outside the country. It was unclear from Gu's remarks whether the chemical firms would be among those companies.
Tianjin Bohai Chemical Group already has a listing on the Hong Kong stock market as well as on the Shanghai exchange while Jilin Chemical Industrial trades in Hong Kong and New York as well as on China's southern bourse in Shenzhen.
Gu said that China's chemical industry needed to raise funds to make technical upgradings and that stock and bond offerings would help reach these goals.
""We are trying to achieve the shift to a quality, intensive mode (of production) from the quantity, extensive model with the aid of foreign capital,"" she said.
China will bar foreign companies from holding controlling stakes in joint ventures with big state enterprises in priority areas such as in soda ash and ""sensitive materials"".
There was no indication of when the move might go into effect, and the policy ""does not mean we are totally opposed to stock control by foreign businesses"", Gu said.
Gu had previously told reporters that China was planning to review its policies towards joint ventures in the chemical industry.
She had suggested that areas where new technology was vital to the development of domestic industry, foreign companies would be allowed to control joint ventures.
But other areas where China had already developed sufficient expertise would be closed to more than 50 percent foreign ownership.
China is particularly encouraging direct foreign investment in fertilisers, ethylene, synthetic materials as well as fine chemical products -- either as wholly owned or jointly owned operations, Gu told the newspaper.
She also criticised the ""westernisation"" of well known domestic products, saying that China needed an integration of foreign brands and domestic products.

49,"A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move, sharply reduced on Friday to five years a prison sentence for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee accused of corruption.
The court's decision followed a brief suspension of technical assistance by the IMF and a Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.
The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court sentenced Hong Yang, 44, a Chinese national, to five years in prison for accepting bribes totalling 100,000 yuan ($12,000) in 1993, before he joined the IMF, the Xinhua news agency said.
""The sentence was dealt with leniently... and according to law,"" Xinhua quoting the court as saying on Friday.
Hong, a former employee of the People's Bank of China, or central bank, was arrested in December while on an IMF mission to China. He was found guilty on June 28.
Beijing sources said the original sentence was for 10 years, although statements by the IMF in Washington put it at 11 years. Hong appealed.
Chinese courts rarely cut sentences on appeal, though an admission of guilt may lead to more lenient treatment.
Camdessus has confirmed reports that Chinese authorities pressured the IMF to include Hong, who had been working at the international organisation's headquarters in Washington, on a mission to China.
The Chinese actions created a furore at the IMF and Camdessus said in a letter to the organisation's staff he would closely monitor a second trial.
""I also urged that the second open trial be transparent and complete and remedy the shortcomings of the first trial,"" Camdessus said after he visited Beijing last month.
Xinhua did not mention the original trial but it highlighted the legality and openness of the second.
It said the case was put on open trial on August 9 and that Hong, his two defence lawyers and four witnesses appeared in court and were involved in the proceedings.
It also said that 200 people, including Hong's relatives and IMF officials, were present.
It added that the man accused of offering the bribe, Fan Honggen, and other individuals from the Agricultural Bank would be dealt with in a separate case. It did not give further details.

49,"China has captured the big prize in its recognition battle with rival Taiwan after South Africa announced plans to switch formal ties to Beijing.
But the lengthy transition of more than one year signals that much bargaining remains on the shape of future relations between the three governments, diplomats in Beijing said on Thursday.
""We...welcome (South African) President Nelson Mandela's positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.
""If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interests to do so,"" he said.
""This is in keeping with the basic interests of the peoples of the two countries,"" Cui said.
Mandela told reporters in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997.
Cui declined to comment on Pretoria's decision to switch only by the end of next year.
""South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan,"" Cui said.
""Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. The People's Republic of China government is the sole, legitimate government of all China,"" he said.
""This has been our longstanding stand. It is very clear... Our stand has not changed,"" the spokesman said.
South Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People's Republic on the mainland.
Taiwan and China have been separated since a civil war ended in 1949. China sees Taiwan as a rebel province not entitled to foreign ties while Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs.
""The South Africans have been the big fish for China,"" said a Beijing-based diplomat. ""The others are just minnows.""
But in most diplomatic divorces, the break is swift, and diplomats said South Africa was still trying to work out its future relationship with both sides.
""They are trying to gain maximum concessions out of the two sides,"" said a diplomat.
South Africa is probably looking for a package deal that includes investment and trade guarantees under a formal legal framework with Taiwan.
It is also hoping to limit damage.
Mandela, announcing the break wtih Taiwan, pointedly thanked the island for its economic support during his nation's transition from minority, white rule to democracy.
The announcement well ahead of formal recognition would also help South Africa preserve its consulate in the British colony of Hong Kong - which returns to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.
South Africa had been hoping to maintain official relations with both sides, a goal that proved unrealistic.
Taiwan had also been looking to duplicate a framework with the Pacific states of Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea which have formal relations with Beijing but have signed a ""mutual recognition pact"" with Taipei, diplomats said.
""These smaller states may get away with a format such as this but South Africa apparently was not in the same category,"" said a diplomat.
"
49,"A top Chinese defence official has stepped down in a reshuffle linked to China's string of satellite failures, political sources said on Friday.
General Ding Henggao has been replaced as Minister of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (COSTIND), a key body charged with overseeing high technology projects related to defence.
Ding, 65, was succeeded at the helm of the ministerial level COSTIND by 61-year-old Cao Gangchuan, a lieutenant-general and deputy chief of general staff of the People's Liberation Army.
""I can confirm that (Ding) stepped down and the change was made in late November or early December,"" said an official of the Defence Ministry.
""I do not know the reason,"" he said.
Sources with close ties to the defence industry told Reuters that Ding had been at the centre of controversy, largely over satellite issues.
""This is partly a matter of age and partly a dispute over satellites,"" said a source.
China successfully launched a satellite in October but that followed a series of failures, the most recent of them last August when a Long March 3 rocket put a U.S.-built satellite into the wrong orbit.
Last February, a Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after liftoff, killing at least six people and injuring 57 on the ground.
In January 1995, a Long March 2E blew up, killing a family of six on the ground and destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.
""There have been bitter disputes over where the responsibility for the failures lies,"" said a source.
COSTIND is responsible for launches while China Aerospace Corporation is in charge of rockets and satellites.
The Soviet-trained Ding, who has a background in missiles and precision engineering, coordinated research and production of strategic missiles as well as satellite launches, according to an official biography.
Ding's departure probably coincided with a reshuffle that replaced the nation's air force and naval commanders, both of whom were also 65 years old.
Ding is the son-in-law of the late Marshal Nie Rongzhen, one of the veteran military leaders of China's communist revolution.
Nie Li, Ding's wife and daughter of Marshal Nie, stepped down from a senior post at COSTIND two years ago.

46,"One of the hottest topics at a recent Internet trade show was so-called ""push technology,"" which directly broadcasts customised news to computer users hooked up to the Net -- but is also seen as the next area ripe for a shakeout     Internet broadcasters are led by companies
like privately held PointCast Inc., which announced a major deal with software giant Microsoft Corp. early last month.
Cupertino, Calif.-based PointCast and several other start-up companies deliver customised news -- or specific Web sites, depending on the service -- to consumer or corporate computer users, up to several times a day.
In other words, instead of searching the Web for the information they want, computer users have it sent directly to them.
The Yankee Group, a Boston research firm, predicts that by the year 2000 Internet broadcasting will be worth $5.7 billion in revenues. It now represents about $10 million in revenues a year.
""Making the Internet a broadcast medium is a direction that a lot of companies are going in, but that's already really crowded,"" said Ted Julian, an analyst with IDC Corp.
At the Internet World trade show, four of the best-known push technology companies exhibited and demonstrated their services, trying to differentiate themselves amid all the hype about direct Internet broadcasting.
But analysts said there are anywhere from 20 to 30 start-ups in this burgeoning area, as many companies are betting the concept will further change the World Wide Web and gain new advertiser interest.
""This is the new Web,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at MecklerMedia Corp., host of the Internet World show.
PointCast was the first company to develop what are called personalized broadcast systems, and it now has 1.7 million subscribers. It delivers news from The New York Times, Boston Globe, Reuters Holdings Plc., and now MSNBC, the cable television-online news venture of Microsoft and General Electric Co.'s NBC.
PointCast and most of the other start-up companies operate on the same advertising-based model. They sell advertising space on their service and offer the service for free to subscribers.
By building up lots of subscribers, they can gain more advertising revenue.
The deal PointCast signed with Microsoft has the potential to significantly expand its subscriber base because PointCast will become part of Microsoft's next-generation computer desktop. Microsoft plans to incorporate its Internet Explorer Web browser in its next version of its Windows operating system, which dominates its market.
In a study last month, the Yankee Group said the Internet broadcasting market will significantly affect the way companies collect advertising dollars on the Web.
""The Web is hitting a wall"" in terms of people signing up for paid subscriptions for information, said analyst Melissa Bain of the Yankee Group. ""The Wall Street Journal (Interactive Edition) is successful, but not every content provider has had success. Users can get the information elsewhere for free.""
Bain said that, according to her report, 51 percent of all online users surveyed said that they typically access or use the same Web sites on a daily basis, making the ""push"" model attractive.
But with many more companies arriving on the scene and Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp. getting into the market, consolidation is on the horizon, because media companies will not want to develop a channel for each delivery system, most of which, for now, are proprietary.
""There is no way I am going to download all four of these, and I am in the industry,"" said Jerry Yang, one of the founders of search engine power Yahoo! Corp. ""This is a huge issue.""
But Yang said that Yahoo! and other Internet search engines are looking at push technology because it will enhance a user's experience with the Web.
""Look for Yahoo to do a lot of development with one of these companies, or a Yahoo!-branded push channel,"" Yang said in a recent interview. ""We will all experiment.""
At Internet World, StarWave Corp., one of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's many investments, demonstrated a service it plans to introduce sometime next year. Patrick Naughton, StarWave's chief technology officer, said the service will be free and demonstrated a television-like advertisement for Levi's on ""StarWave TV.""
Even the players themselves are predicting a shakeout.
Harmon of Meckler predicts that push technology will fuel a hot new wave of Internet initial public offerings. But unlike the search engine fever, when a bevvy of small, unprofitable companies went public -- only to see their stock prices sharply decline -- consolidation will come first, he said.
Another player, Freeloader, was purchased last year by Individual Inc. of Burlington, Mass. Freeloader lets subcribers choose what Web sites they want delivered to their computers and obtain news via Individual.
""Clearly, there will be a big shakeout,"" said Freeloader President Sunil Paul, adding that there is a lot of chaos right now. ""PointCast clearly stands out, and we will be one of them (the survivors).
Another much-talked-about start-up, IFusion, is offering television-like content with video and audio in its service, which will be introduced early this year and called Arrive.
The company that created some of the recent frenzy about ""push"" technology is Marimba Inc., founded by several former Sun Microsystems Inc. employees.
Marimba did not exhibit at Internet World, but the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company, which develops software tools to create these ""channels"" using Sun's Java programming language, was mentioned by everyone. Marimba, along with PointCast, were seen as the potential early IPO candidates of this sector.

46,"International Business Machines Corp reported strong third quarter results on Monday but raised concern about the fourth quarter, sending shares on a roller-coaster ride.
IBM's third quarter earnings of $2.45 a share was just two cents above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.43. IBM opened off, then climbed to 135-3/8 during its analysts' call.
But analysts said comments by its chief financial officer about continuing negative impact from currency, memory prices and higher expenses dampened his otherwise bullish outlook.  
""There were some cautionary comments about fourth quarter,"" said Jay Stevens, a Dean Witter analyst, adding that he was revising his fourth quarter estimates.
Some analysts started cutting fourth quarter numbers after the conference call, reflecting the company's comments about a bigger currency impact, continued drop in memory chip prices and higher-than-expected fourth quarter restructuring costs.
In general, analysts said they were pleased with IBM's ongoing cost-cutting, its successful transition to new products in all its hardware areas and its investments in its future growth. Revenue growth was also better than expected.  
""I think the most impressive was the revenue growth,"" said Stephen Dube, a Wasserstein Perrella analyst. ""It's coming from all other products except for mainframes."" As expected, IBM said its mainframe revenues fell in the quarter.
Previously, IBM had expected that currency and memory chip prices would have a diminished impact on the second half.
But Monday, IBM said it could have a slightly bigger negative impact from currency rates than the $0.08 a share it saw in the third quarter and memory prices would continue to hurt its semiconductor business, comments that had a dampening effect on analysts hoping for a very strong fourth quarter.  
Analysts still expect IBM to report a strong fourth quarter, because many other products are doing well and it will also begin to see sales of its recently shipped models of its lower-cost mainframes. But they also need to account for IBM's comments that it will begin spreading out some of its mainframes sales over several quarters.
G. Richard Thoman, IBM's chief financial officer, told Wall Street that a ""growing proportion"" of IBM's mainframes sales are going through its computer services business, and therefore, IBM will not see the full sales in a quarter for all its machines.  
""If you sell a mainframe for $100,000 and you lease it or it's on a services contract ... rather than $100,000 at once, you have $8,000 a quarter,"" Thoman said in an interview, adding that this is ""just an example.""
Thoman buoyed analysts with news that IBM's mainframe installations, which grew 25 perent, are growing ""almost back to 1980s"" levels. But even with such strong customer interest, IBM's prices are still so low that revenues are still expected to decline, while mainframe profits are forecast to be hefty.
""This quarter it did not come from mainframes,"" said Stephen Dube, a Wasserstein Perella Securities analyst.
""Mainframes are not a growth area for them,"" he said. But mainframes are still IBM's second most profitable hardware product, after its AS/400 minicomputers.
The fourth quarter was also marred by a prediction that IBM will take a bigger-than-expected restructuring cost. Originally, IBM had predicted about $200 million per quarter this year, but said on Monday that it will spend an additional $100 million to $200 million in the fourth quarter.
IBM said the increase resulted from more employees taking its voluntary buyout plan in Europe in the fourth quarter.
"
46,"The stock of IBM, which in recent years was derisively dubbed ""I've Been Mugged,"" is back trading at historic highs, with many analysts and traders predicting its shares will continue to soar.
The major rally was sparked last Friday when an influential Wall Street analyst, Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch, raised his 12-month price target on International Business Machines Corp, to $195 from about $155.
Since Friday, IBM's shares have soared 20.2 percent to 153-3/4 at Tuesday's close of market.  
One question now among investors is whether to jump in at these levels like sheep, or wait for IBM's stock to decline.
Market technicians and some analysts who follow IBM say that its once-beleaguered stock still has room to climb.
Even after Friday's run-up, analyst Steve Milunovich of Morgan Stanley on Monday raised his 12-month price target to $170, from $145.
IBM's shares are now trading at levels its shares have not seen since before the 1987 stock market crash, having in fact reached a nine-year high.  
""It still sells at a relatively low valuation, relative to the technology sector,"" Milton said.
Technology stocks typically trade at a price/earnings ratio of about 20 times their earnings estimates. But even with its intraday surge Tuesday of 7-1/4, IBM is still trading at a P/E of only about 14.2 times its trailings earnings estimates.
IBM's shares have climbed nearly 70 percent since July 15, when it was trading around 90-7/8.  
Market technicians, who use charts, graphs and computer analysis without considering company fundamentals, said that IBM's shares have recently broken out of two previous resistance levels on the charts, one at 128 and another at 148, and are now poised for a further uptick.
""At these levels there really isn't much resistance, this can continue to work higher,"" said Susan Stern, a senior technical analyst at Smith Barney. Resistance refers to a price ceiling where a stock price consolidates.  
""I think the primary trend remains up,"" said Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at EVEREN Securities Inc. ""The stock is getting a little extended on a short-term basis.""
Traders seem to agree. One technology trader said he has now covered a short position in IBM. ""I think the move has probably been overdone short-term, but on a valuation, it is a lot cheaper than a lot of tech stocks,"" the trader said. ""The way it's been trading, it's got a little more to go.""
However some more bearish analysts point out that since Mandresh and Milunovich upped their price tagets on IBM's stock price, neither analyst increased earnings estimates.  
Stephen Smith, a PaineWebber analyst, said that he believes some of the fourth quarter 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates on Wall Street for the world's largest computer maker are too high.
""Obviously they have done a good job financially, but it's going to be a lot tougher for them going forward,"" Smith said, adding that he believes IBM has already seen the biggest positive swing in its earnings it will get from its transition to lower-cost mainframe computers based on CMOS technology.
When IBM was in the midst of a huge losses, a management upheaval and restructuring, and its first dividend cuts in 1993, its shares sunk to a low of 43, where it gained the moniker of ""I've Been Mugged"" by many traders on Wall Street.
Now, with a steady stream of profits and many bullish views by analysts, some market analysts are again viewing the stock as a bellwether that is also helping fuel movements in the Dow Jones Industrial average.
"
46,"Netscape Communications Corp. and five regional Bell phone companies said Tuesday that the five ""Baby Bells"" will use Netscape's Navigator software as the main browser for their Internet access businesses.
Participating in the deal with Netscape were the Internet access units of Ameritech Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp., BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group and SBC Communications Inc..
The move was seen as a much-needed boost for Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape, which has seen its popular Navigator software become the secondary browser to Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer as the software behemoth made big inroads with the biggest online services.
""A few months ago, they (Netscape) announced a focus on the corporate marketplace,"" said Abhishek Gami, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities. ""This is a little reminder from them that they are still a big player in the consumer marketplace.""
This year, America Online Inc, and CompuServe Inc. have forged deals with Microsoft to make Internet Explorer their primary Internet browser, and in return the online services have gained a spot on the Windows 95 desktop.
""It's a very good boost of confidence for Netscape, which has seen a very large defection from the online services,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst at Arlen Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md.
Netscape shares jumped $3 to $63 in heavy trading on Nasdaq.
Together, the five Bell companies represent a potential market of 72 million consumers and businesses in 26 states, including Washington, D.C., and 15 of the nation's 20 largest markets.
Bell Atlantic said it also has an agreement with Microsoft and that it will begin offering Internet Explorer as an option to its customers in the first quarter of 1997.
Robert Beran, president of Bell Atlantic's Internet unit, told reporters in a conference call that the arrangement gives the phone companies a new way to market their Internet services via Netscape's Web site. He also said it gives new Net users a way to find another Internet service provider.
But analysts also pointed out that the five Baby Bells combined represent under 100,000 Internet users. Ameritech of Chicago still has not yet introduced its Internet service, but said it will do so ""reasonably soon.""
Pacific Bell, has the biggest Internet access business of the five, with 51,000 members at last count.
The agreement includes a feature to simplify how computer users select an Internet service provider, or ISP.
Users running Netscape Navigator would be able to contact their telephone company's Internet service provider through the new Netscape ISP Select feature on Netscape's Web site, the companies said. After users enter their area code and phone number, they will be presented with a list of service providers with coverage in their particular area.
Netscape said the ISP Select service will allow people to set up a personal Internet account and establish an Internet connection easily and quickly. In addition, phone company customers would have free access to newspaper and magazine content from the Netscape In-Box Direct service, in which personalized publications arrive via e-mail.
Netscape In-Box is a service recently introduced by Netscape to provide information from 40 selected content providers. The company said that since it was launched just a few months ago, its In-Box service has obtained more than 1.5 million subscriptions.
The ISP Select feature will be available on Netscape's Web site, with its Personal Navigator edition that is sold in stores, and will be bundled with some PCs.
They said future plans include offering the ability for ISP Select users who choose their local telephone company's Internet access service to have their Internet fees billed directly to their phone bills.

46,"CompuServe Corp is expected to announce on Thursday that it is dissolving its Wow! consumer online service as it gives up on the consumer market and refocuses on the corporate market, industry sources said.
A spokesman for the Columbus, Ohio based company declined to comment, saying he could not comment in advance of a ""strategic announcement"" CompuServe plans early Thursday.
The struggling online services company has been under more pressure in recent months from America Online Inc, the Microsoft Corp Network and Internet access providers.
The company plans to halt its marketing aimed at consumers and it will expand its emphasis on corporate customers in the U.S. and Europe. CompuServe will try to convert its 100,000 Wow! users to its core CompuServe Information Service and it will not abandon its current consumer users, sources said.
But it will not make the consumer business a key focus, as it cedes to the dominant America Online, which is growing its subscriber base again, after a hiccup in growth this summer.
Wall Street analysts said that such a move could entail some layoffs at CompuServe, and possibly a restructuring charge to cover Wow! employees who cannot be reassigned.  
CompuServe's move comes on the heels of some recent aggressive actions by AOL to stay on top with its plans to shut down its GNN direct Internet access and its announcement to cut its workforce by 300 employees and take a $75 million charge in its second fiscal quarter.
AOL also announced flat-rate pricing of $19.95 a month for unlimited access, bowing to the competition from Internet access providers and their flat monthly rates of $19.95.
CompuServe's Wow! service is a flat-rate service, for $17.95 a month, but it could not be learned if CompuServe will change the pricing of its core CIS service as it dissolves Wow.  
CompuServe hopes to move all its Wow! subscribers over to its core service by the end of January.
""They have a separate productions staff, separate marketing, etc,"" said Abhishek Gami, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities, adding however that CompuServe has tried to keep Wow! extremely lean and some employees will likely be moved to the main service or to SPRYNET, its Internet service.
Since CompuServe went public in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from its initial offering price of $30 a share. Its shares now trade at around $11-5/8, since it has announced losses and a drop in subscribers.  
""They have had a whole lot of problems since they went public,"" said one industry source. ""They need to reposition the company.""
CompuServe is the second largest online service after America Online.
"
46,"America Online Inc, the world's largest online service, said with the changes it implemented earlier this fall and its major restructuring announced this week, it is seeing a renewed momentum.
Steve Case, AOL chairman and CEO, told the company's annual meeting that with the reoganization of AOL, its new flat-rate pricing, and its big accounting changes, ""the pieces are now in place"" for growth, not only in new subscribers, but with major new sources of revenue, such as advertising.  
""Now we have a new structure in place...and the momentum is stronger than ever,"" Case told shareholders, adding that in the month of October alone, AOL added 250,000 new subscribers, a sign of its ""renewed momentum.""
The company, which has seen its stock decline, has been under pressure from the lower-cost Internet access services and has seen its subscriber growth slow this summer.  
AOL, based in Dulles, Va., was further pressured when Microsoft Corp relaunched the Microsoft Network this month at a flat price of $19.95 for unlimited access, on par with most direct Internet access services.
Previously, AOL had added a 20/20 pricing plan to combat the growing competition, with 20 hours for $19.95 a month, in addition to its $9.95 for 10 hours plan.  But on Monday, it succumbed with its own flat rate $19.95 a month, and it will discontinue its direct Internet access, called GNN.  
Case and other AOL executives highlighted to shareholders how the company will see new sources of revenue from advertising and merchandising and how one area of its new business will be running on a cable industry model, with more revenues from advertising than subscriber fees.
""Increasingly, we are evolving where we depend less on subscriber revenue and increasingly on advertising and other sources,"" said Lennert Leader, the company's chief financial officer.  
One of the areas from which the company expects this growth to come is its new unit AOL Networks, headed by former MTV executive Bob Pittman, to oversee AOL's flagship online service.  The other two units in AOL's reorganization are its AOL Studios, to create content for its service and ANS Communications, to manage the core network infrastructure.
Pittman said he expects that in the future, over 50 percent of AOL's revenues will come from advertising and other revenue sources, such as merchandising the AOL brand name, through books, television, etc.  
""To me, it looks very similar to the cable network business,"" Pittman said, adding that in the early days of Viacom Inc's MTV network, subscriber revenue was greater than advertising revenue.  ""Our growth curve looks very similar to the cable business.  Ad revenue is growing faster than subsciber revenues.""
Pittman said he plans to ""ride the tremendous wave"" of AOL's brand recognition for new sources of revenue growth, for which he said there are multi-levels of possibilities. One area, he mentioned after his second day on the job, is the catalog business, which can move to electronic shopping.  
Shareholders, some of whom said the stock has been a very good investment because of its many stock splits, said they were pleased with AOL's recent actions, in particular the measure to restructure accounting methods.
""The fact that they are getting a more straightforward accounting system is a step in the right direction,"" said David Ryan, a retired shareholder from the Washington, D.C. area. ""Their financial statements were hard to understand. It's more straightforward now.""  Ryan said the stock has split three times since he has owned it in the past four or five years.  
AOL said on Monday that it will now expense all its marketing costs, which includes the hefty subscriber acquisition costs, as they are incurred, instead of deferring those costs over time.
To reflect those immediate changes, AOL is taking a $385 million restructuring charge in the September quarter, to account for the balance of its deferred subscriber acquisition costs.  AOL CFO Leader also told the meeting that the cost to acquire new subscribers will be lower in the future, as AOL depends less on sending out floppy disks, and as AOL comes with more new PCs.
""The good news is the growth is accelerating,"" Case said. ""We have taken the step of expensing the marketing and we can avoid some of the debates about the earnings.""

46,"Digital Equipment Corp.'s top executives host computer industry analysts Tuesday, hoping to impart a view of a brighter future and re-ignite interest in the company's downtrodden stock on Wall Street.
Analysts expect the Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker, which just last month reported a big fourth-quarter loss and restructuring charge, to focus on its long-term direction and goal of reaching operating margins of 6-7 percent of revenues.
""They are going to talk about their vision of the future,"" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst.
He said Digital will likely focus on its growth areas, such as servers designed on its fast Alpha chip that run Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT software, prospects for its computer services business, growth in semiconductors and its plans to spin off part of its Alta Vista Internet unit.
But after Digital's most recent loss, Wall Street will likely also be looking for any forecast for the first quarter, in which some analysts project a loss.
In the fourth quarter ended June 30, Digital reported a loss of $433 million, or $2.87 a share, after taking a $492 million restructuring charge for job cuts and plant closings.
Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich recently wrote in a report that the first fiscal quarter is off to a slow start.
""Management indicated that first quarter is off to a slow start, likely due to short-term disruption from sales force changes,"" Milunovich said. ""A loss appears increasingly likely.""
According to First Call, which monitors Wall Street earnings estimates, the consensus estimate for DEC's first quarter is a loss of 3 cents a share.
Many analysts expect the tone of the meeting to be positive, as Digital executives highlight the company's strengths and growth opportunities. But they are also hoping for some hints at Digital's fix-it plans for its PC business.
""The story for the Alpha server business, the networking business, the storage business and the semiconductor division is quite encouraging,"" John Jones of Salomon Brothers said in a report to clients. ""But PCs are a big overhang currently.""
In the fourth quarter, Digital's PC business lost more money than it had previously expected, estimated around $90 million, and analysts said speculation is ""rampant"" that Digital is looking for a manufacturing partner to help shave costs in PCs.
But Digital is not expected to make any announcements on the unit, other to confirm that it is seeking a manufacturing partner.
""They will talk about how they are going to change the sourcing of their PCs,"" Helmig said. ""They will talk about the fact that they are doing it, but they won't be able to announce what they are doing. They haven't dotted the I's and crossed the T's.""
Analysts said one of Digital's biggest opportunities for improving gross margins is in services, which had margins of 32 percent of revenues in 1996. Services is also a growth engine for International Business Machines Corp..
They will also be eager for details on Digital's plans to spin off 20 percent of its Alta Vista Internet software unit.
Alta Vista is Digital's popular and powerful search engine for finding entries on the Internet's vast World Wide Web.
Digital plans to retain 80 percent of the unit, which will also develop other kinds of Internet software, aiming to capitalize on the Alta Vista brand name.
Analysts said the motive behind spinning off part of Alta Vista is likely that its shares may do better if they trade separately from Digital, which has seen its stock drop from a high of 76-1/2 in February to 38-5/8 on Friday.

46,"Computer makers are expected to report solid fourth-quarter earnings in what is normally the strongest quarter of the year, but the stronger dollar will hurt some big systems makers.
Despite all the negative reports from computer retailers about lackluster personal computer sales, analysts said most U.S. PC makers -- with the exception of Apple Computer Inc. and AST Research Inc. -- will show strong sales growth, fuelled by hefty corporate buying.
Apple is the first to report, with first-quarter results due late on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, Cupertino, California-based Apple forecast it would report an operating loss for its first quarter ended last month, citing weak U.S. demand for its Performa consumer PC and continued shortages of notebook computers.
Chip-maker Intel Corp, powered by surging demand for its Pentium and Pentium Pro microprocessors, reported on Tuesday its fourth quarter profits more than doubled to $1.9 billion, exceeding even Wall Street's most optimistic estimates.
""Most of the indications are that business throughout the (PC) sector, other than Apple, was strong,"" said Dean Witter analyst Eugene Glazer. ""With all the negative comments you are hearing from retailers, some of that market was going to the direct marketers"" like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc.
Analysts said the world's largest PC maker, Compaq Computer Corp, was likely to report strong earnings, especially after semiconductor giant Intel Corp. reported a blowout fourth quarter, surpassing Wall Street predictions.
Compaq gets about 20 percent or so of its revenues via store sales to consumers and the rest of its revenues from sales to corporate customers, which were booming.
""The consumer business didn't hurt them,"" said Jim Poyner, an Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst. ""Dell and Compaq are benefiting from the same forces, the transition to the Pentium Pro (chip), a hot notebook (computer) market and progress in the server (network computer) business.""
On the larger systems side, companies like International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Unisys Corp. are expected to see some negative impact from a stronger dollar overseas and sluggish sales in Europe, while business in the United States remains strong.
""Business is quite good in the U.S.,"" said Jay Stevens, another Dean Witter analyst. ""Where it's slower, or where the concerns have been expressed, is overseas, mostly in Europe.""
Digital is expected to report a slight profit as it slowly recovers from sales force problems in Europe and a money-losing PC business. PCs are expected to break even.
""I think it will be a good quarter,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich.
Analysts said that they expected IBM's earnings to be a bit better than expected, but that its expenses for job cuts will be greater than previous quarters.
""Europe remains a slower grower, which has led to a number of organisational and planned efficiency changes,"" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst. IBM reports its earnings next Tuesday.

46,"Upstart satellite company EchoStar Communications Corp -- in the business only since March -- gave the nascent industry a major jolt this month when it cut prices sharply.
Then on Monday, Thomson, which dominates the satellite TV dish market, matched EchoStar's $199 price.
Thomson executives said the new price will surely shake up the industry and fuel sales for what is the said to be the fastest growing consumer electronics product ever -- one that even now is taking market share from the cable industry.  
""It will completely change the nature of the business,"" said Joe Clayton, an executive vice president at Thomson, the U.S. unit of Thomson-CSF in France.
The move by Thomson cut the price of the RCA brand digital satellite system by as much as $200 a unit. Combined with a $200 cash back offer by programming providers DirecTV -- a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp -- and U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Co, it cuts the total price to $199 for consumers who pre-pay for one year of programming.
The lower price will make it harder for new entrants in the industry to make money.  
""We know the telcos and the cable companies are getting more involved,"" Clayton said. ""We are going to capitalize on our strengths now.""
He added that the $199 price will make the ""awareness base explode.""
Thomson has an estimated 45 percent of the digital satellite system dish market, which amounted to 3.4 million units at the end of July, according to the Carmel Group.
""It's been a real winner for them,"" said Jimmy Schaeffler, an analyst at Carmel, a market research firm in Carmel, Calif. ""Plus it has launched them into the international marketplace.""  
Schaeffler said that, outside the United States, satellite television is gaining markets where there is no cable because it can leapfrog installing massive cable systems.
""Most of the rest of the world is not very cable wired, so there is a clear opportunity for direct broadcast satellite,"" Schaeffler said. Satellite TV is also becoming big in the U.S., as vaunted digital cable systems undergo trials.
New competitors see an opportunity in digital satellites -- a technology that is here now and working. MCI Communications, aligned with Rupert Murdoch's New Corp Ltd, already has a valuable U.S. satellite slot.  
When asked how low prices of the satellite dishes could go, Clayton joked he had never seen prices in consumer electronics go up. Analysts expects prices to keep falling.
""Maybe Charlie will take it to zero, but I don't think we will,"" Clayton said of EchoStar chairman Charles Ergen.
A spokeswoman said Englewood, Colo.-based EchoStar, which launched its satellite network in March, already has 125,000 subscribers for its programming, which has 40 TV channels and 30 of music, compared with 175 channels offered by DirecTV. The launch next month of a second satellite will increase its offerings to up to 200 channels, EchoStar said.

46,"International Business Machines Corp said its $80 million acquisition of Edmark Corp will serve as the core for the computer giant's plans to focus on education in its fledgling consumer products unit.
The deal will also give Edmark access to IBM's worldwide distribution tentacles, which it needs to compete in the cut-throat consumer retail market, where the brutal fight for shelf space can sometimes make or break a software company.
""This gives us a very strong foundation,"" said Jim Firestone, general manager, IBM Consumer Division.  
""We are working with a handful of other firms, but I expect Edmark to be the real core of this activity,"" Firestone added. ""It is a base upon which we expect to grow.""
Firestone, formerly of American Express Co, was appointed to head up IBM's newly-created consumer business in July, 1995. He was faced with a daunting task because IBM's previous forays into the home PC market have not met with much success and it is not well known for its consumer software.
As part of his refocusing of IBM in the consumer arena, Firestone said IBM will only choose a few places to compete, and one of those areas will be the family educational market.  
""I am not interested in the entertainment side of consumer software,"" Firestone said. He also said IBM's latest models of its Aptiva home PC that it introduced in September, is gaining market share, where it is being marketed as a family learning tool. Software from Edmark will fit in with that focus.
""IBM is focused on learning as the magic bullet that will elevate their position and raise their profile,"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, director of consumer research at IDC/Link. ""Edmark has some very valuable properties...This acquisition should be seen as one in a series of major moves that will help IBM achieve some of its goals in the consumer market.""  
Analysts said that many of Edmark's software titles, such as its newly-released Mighty Math Series, Stanley's Stickers Stories and its Thinkin' Things Series are very popular in the industry. IBM's consumer software titles, such as its recent CD-ROM based on the Pinocchio movie, have not fared well.
""They have had mixed results,"" said Zwetchkenbaum.
Analysts also that there could be more deals in the educational software market, because some of the stock prices have fallen so low and the competition is fierce. Edmark's shares once traded at a 52-week high of 43-1/2.

29,"French state-owned airline Air France said on Thursday it was ready to take on the toughening competition in its domestic market posed by British Airways Plc (BA).
BA's TAT French unit on Wednesday announced a joint 780 million franc bid ($151.2 million) with bank Rivaud for domestic carrier Air Liberte that will double its share of takeoff and landing slots at Paris' busy second airport Orly to 20 percent.
An Air France spokeswoman acknowledged BA's increased presence in France aviation would have an impact.
""It certainly has consequences for us. But we will continue with improving our product and service while cutting our costs and prices,"" she said.
After approval by the Creteil commercial court, scheduled to meet on Friday, and an Air Liberte creditors meeting due within a month, BA would take a 70 percent stake in loss-making Air Liberte.
A spokesman for Air France Europe, the domestic wing of the Air France operation, said the company had an 80 percent market stake on the routes it operates and 60 percent on the total French market.
But from April 1997, European liberalisation of the airline industry will fully throw open French airspace to competition.
The French government moved the door ajar at the start of 1996 by allowing competition on the busy Paris-Toulouse and Paris-Marseille routes which were controlled by state-owned Air Inter, part of the Air France group.
Other French airlines had been allowed to fly less busy domestic routes as well as European and international routes.
British Airways bought its first 49.9 percent stake in TAT in 1993 and obtained the remainder last July.
Air Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war against Air France Europe, the renamed Air Inter. As a result they have suffered financially.
AOM, headed by Alexandre de Couvelaire, had been in talks with Air Liberte with an eye to a merger but the worsening financial situation at Air Liberte, which sought creditor protection on September 26, made a deal impossible.
AOM, 99 percent owned by the Consortium de Realisation (CDR) which was set up to sell assets of bank Credit Lyonnais, is now going it alone with some 10 percent of the slot at Orly.
But industry sources said Air France could strike back in 1997 and make a bid for AOM to prevent another foreign airline from setting foot in France alongside British Airways.
Air France Europe plans to launch its ""Shuttle"" service between Paris and Toulouse next Monday, offering more departure times and a ""turn up and go"" service without reservations, as a major plank in its new commercial approach.
Other airlines in France are Air Littoral, owned by the Dufour family, the Dubreuil family's Regional airlines, Xavier Leclerq's Brit Airlines as well as Nouvelles Frontieres' Corsair and Euralair.
For Air France, these domestic lines are important potential feeder operations for its international operations.
Last week Air france signed cooperation pacts with Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines Inc of the U.S. and it aims to sign a similar deal with an Asian airline in 1997.
These pacts are based on the ""hub and spoke"" theory in which airlines boost traffic by taking passengers from a smaller airport to a big ""hub"" for long distance flights to another hub. From the second hub another smaller plane can be used to take the passenger to the final destination. ($1=5.157 French Franc)

29,"France's state-owned electricity utility Electricite de France (EDF) said on Wednesday it had made a 850 million franc asset gain selling its 10 percent stake in Sweden's Sydkraft AB to Norway's Statkraft SF.
""It allows us to realise a big asset gain and the deal is also the start of an alliance with Statkraft,"" EDF chairman Edmond Alphandery told a news conference.
EDF officials said the alliance with Statkraft, also a state-owned utility, would mainly be in the form of cooperation in hydroelectric projects in southeast Asia.
EDF is selling its 6.808 million class A and 12.395 million class C shares in Sydkraft AB to Statkraft for a sum of 2.130 billion francs. This allows the Norwegian firm to increase its stake in Sydkraft to 15 percent. The formal transfer of ownership will take place in November.
EDF took its stake in Sydkraft, Sweden's biggest power firm, two years ago but it changed its strategy in April when its Northelec unit obtained a 25 percent stake in Graningeverkens AB, Sweden's number six power group. It later raised the stake.
Northelec is a joint venture with Skanska.
""It's better to have a big stake in a small company than to have a small stake in a big company,"" Alphandery said.
""At Sydkraft we did not even have a seat on the board, at Graninge we have a shareholders' pact allowing us to effectively control the company,"" he added.
EDF has a shareholders pact with Sweden's industrial family Versteegh and jointly they own 54 percent of Graninge.
""We saw the strategic value of the Nordic market and we have been able to cash in on the asset gain because the value of Sydkraft shares has risen a lot,"" he said.
Alphandery, a former economics minister named to EDF in November to replace Gilles Menage who was an appointee of the former Socialist government and an aide to Francois Mitterand, said the sale was proof of EDF's willingness to ""realise an asset gain when there is one.""
He did not expect further sales from EDF's international portfolio. The French utility in 1996 alone has made commitments totalling 4.6 billion francs in foreign stakes and Alphandery said EDF would continue its expansion mainly in the Mercosur area in Latin America and in southeast Asia including China.
EDF obtained a stake in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro power utility Light and Edenor in Argentina. Last year, it obtained stakes in two Hungarian companies. It als has investments in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ivory Coast and South Africa.
""We can use the asset gain on Sydkraft to finance our international expansion,"" Alphandery said.
""This refocusing of Northern European strategy shows EDF's desire to be a major international and industrial operator, actively managing its investment portfolio,"" EDF said.
EDF's decision to leave Sydkraft makes Germany's Preussen Elektra AG, a unit of Veba AG, the biggest shareholder with 17.6 percent of shares and 27.1 percent of votes. The city of Malmo is second biggest with 11.8 percent of shares and 18.9 percent of votes, followed by Statkraft and some pension funds.
Sydkraft has a 20 percent stake in Graninge and Veba's Preussenelektra 12.4 percent.

29,"French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Monday the procedure followed in the planned sale of Thomson SA was beyond criticism.
France's independent privatisation commission, however, always had the right to block the deal, he added.
""It is my conviction that the procedure followed by the government is unassailable. The law has been respected,"" Arthuis told Reuters on Monday.
""The privatisation commission is an independent body. It has full authority and I cannot prejudge the decision it will take. It is sovereign,"" he said.
Thomson's planned privatisation has raised a storm of criticism in France. The opposition Socialists and Communists in the National Assembly have called for a committee of inquiry into the conditions of Thomson's privatisation.
The French privatisation commission, comprising seven ""wise men"", is currently assessing the value of Thomson SA and its proposed sale to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo Electronics. The commission is expected to issue its decision early December.
Commission members are appointed by decree for five years during which they cannot hold any other function.
The commission is currently chaired by Pierre Laurent, a former section chairman at the country's highest constitutional authority, the Conseil d'Etat or State Council.
Its members are Pierre Alby, a honorary chairman of Gaz de France, Andre Blanc, Daniel Deguen, honorary chairman of bank Credit Commercial de France, Daniel Hua, honorary managing director of bank Societe Generale, Jean Serise and Jean Pineau.
The Bank of France's Francoise Pallo-Guillabert is the commission secretary general.
The commission has the task of determining the value of state assets which are being sold, and to express an opinion about the government's choice.
A spokeswoman for the Finance Ministry said that the goverment always made its preference clear to the commission but sofar has never publicly stated its preference.
In the case of Thomson, however, Arthuis judged it necessary to publish the government's preference to avoid insider dealing because both bidders, Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom, are quoted companies.
There is only one case known where the privatisation commission did not agree with the government -- at the start of 1996 the commission opposed the sale of the state's 83.3 percent stake Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) because it considered the bids too low.
""The first thing the commission has to do is to establish the value of Thomson and see whether indeed it is worth minus 11 billion francs, as both bidders say,"" a ministry official said.
""After that they will have to express their opinion on the government's choice,"" he added.
If the privatisation commission's decision, expected by the end of the year, would be in line with the government's preference there still remain hurdles.
The European Commission in Brussels has to agree with the planned state capital injection of 11 billion francs and has to consider the competition aspects of the deal.
"
29,"Jacques Maillot, the chairman of travel group Nouvelles Frontieres who dropped out of bidding for Air Liberte, is now talking to acquire airline AOM, a spokeswoman for his travel group said.
Maillot on Wednesday announced that he and partner Royal Air Maroc had withdrawn their participation in talks to rescue Air Liberte, in administration since September 26, because of the size of the financial commitment required.
A 780 million franc bid by British Airways Plc French TAT unit and bank Rivaud is now the only remaining on the table and expected to be approved by the Creteil commercial court on Friday.
But Maillot, also chairman of small French airline Corsair, told La Tribune that his withdrawal did not mean he had given up his ambitions to create a private French airline group.
""I remain a candidate for the takeover of AOM, that remains my priority,"" he told the paper. He was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
Maillot had planned to buy Air Liberte with the help of Royal Air Maroc, holiday resorts group Club Mediterranee and Rivaud. In a second stage he had planned to enlarge his consortium to acquire AOM and merge Corsair, Air Liberte and AOM in a big French group to rival the state-owned Air France group.
AOM, created in 1991 by the merger of Air Outre Mer and Minerve, is owned by the Consortium de Realisation (CDR), a state entity charged with selling former assets of the Credit Lyonnais bank.
AOM is worth about one billion francs, according to industry sources. Maillot said that talks with the CDR had already started but he added that no timetable had been fixed.
""Before anything, we need to know the price of AOM. That is not the case today,"" he told La Tribune.
This summer, former AOM chairman Alexandre Couvelaire had been in talks with Air Liberte chairman and founder Lotfi Belhassine about a merger.
But the deteriorating financial situation at Air Liberte led to a break-up of talks. The CDR has since fired Couvelaire.
Couvelaire had a 10 percent stake in Air Liberte and previously headed small airline Euralair. He was appointed in June 1996 to replace Mark Rochet who had jumped ship to TAT.
In his statement on Wednesday, announcing his withdrawal from Air Liberte, Maillot said his ambitions were unchanged.
""The first tourist group in France, Nouvelles Frontieres, which is active in air transport since many years through its Corsair subsidiary, the only airline in France with systemic postive results since the takeover in 1990, remains available to participate in the constitution of a a private group of which the necessity seems, at least as far as words are concerned, to be felt unanimously and which has become more urgent today than yesterday,"" he said in the statement.
""It is necessary not to compromise the success of such an ambition which implies the both restucturing of the Groupe AOM and, later, the privatisation of Groupe Air France,"" he said.
""It is totally clear that there is urgency and there is no more time for hesitations,"" he added.
"
29,"Analysts were mixed on the Rhone-Poulenc SA third quarter results and some said they might raise full-year forecasts while others left forecasts unchanged.
""The figures are better than we had forecast,"" said analyst Guy Phillips at BZW in London.
""Especially the operating profit at life sciences, pharmaceuticals pleased. It was an encouraging set of results,"" he said.
Phillips said he was considering raising his profit per share forecast from eight francs to 8.5 francs.
But Brokers Leven in Paris said there was no reason to adjust estimates.
Shaw Bridges at Merill Lynch said that while health care earnings were better than expected, the performance of fibres and chemicals had been weaker. He kept his forecast for 1996 net attributable profit of 2.7 billion francs, against 2.134 billion in 1995.
He also maintained his ""hold"" rating for the shares because they were ""fairly valued"". He said the company was an attractive long-term investment.
Bridges said he expected a full-year provision of 500 million francs at Rhone-Poulenc, mainly at chemicals and fibres. Rhone took 1.73 billion in provisions in 1995.
""The results are in line with expectations. They confirm that Rhone-Poulenc is a company pulled forward by its pharmaceuticals and agro,"" said Liliane Gauffre at Paris brokers BNP Du Bouzet.
Rhone-Poulenc reported a third quarter net income of 756 million francs versus 669 million at the same stage last year and an operating profit of 2.054 billion francs versus 1.828 billion previously.
Net sales were 20.468 billion francs versus 19.621 billion.
For the first nine months, net income was up 10.5 percent at 2.166 billion francs.
The operating profit at health sciences, which includes pharmaceuticals and animal health, jumped to 1.583 billion francs from 977 billion.
Finance director Jean-Pierre Tirouflet said the increase was in line with the company's forecasts about the synergy effects of the acquisition of Fisons in 1995 and was also due to new products.
He cited the anti-cancer drug Taxotere, Lovenox, Granocyte as well as Hepatitis A and B vaccines as examples.
Tirouflet also said there had been good sales in anti-fever vaccines in the United States.
But brokers Lehman Brothers said Taxotere and Rilutek were taking off slowly. It downgraded the share to neutral from outperform, after a good recent run.
Thierry le Francois of Massonaud said he expected a 1996 net income of 2.5 billion and further charges for the recall of albumin products. He re-itereated his buy advice on the share.

29,"Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of Lagardere Groupe, said on Saturday that his group was not going to sell Thomson's prized digital television know-how to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
Lagardere, adressing students at the Sorbonne university during a weekend seminar on industry, said in his first public comments after winning the bidding for state-owned Thomson that he had selected Daewoo as partner because it was the best guarantee for jobs at Thomson's French production units.
The French government on Wednesday announced it had selected Lagardere to buy state-owned Thomson SA for one franc, after an 11-billion francs capital injection.
Lagardare had been bidding against telecommunication equipment and industrial engineering group Alcatel Alsthom.
Lagardere Groupe plans to merge its Matra defense business with Thomson's 58-percent unit Thomson-CSF, after buying out the minorities on the Paris Bourse, and has agreed to sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo -- also for a symbolic franc.
Lagardere heard the news that his group had won the bidding, -- against expectations as the French media expected Alcatel Alsthom and its no-nonsense chairman Serge Tchuruk to be the winners -- on Tuesday evening during an official dinner at the start of a Picasso exhibition in Paris.
""I did not feel like I received the golden medal,"" Lagardere said. ""I felt like I was selected to play for France,"" the 69-year old businessman said.
""In four year's time, while I will then still be involved in our business, I hope that people like (Matra boss) Noel Forgeard can celebrate the award of a golden medal. We will have a good team in an industry where competition is without pity,"" he said.
Lagardere, a Gascogne farmer's son who built a worldwide books-to-missiles business empire from a small company he joined 32-years ago, is facing criticism by some French media and labour unions for selling the Multimedia business to Daewoo.
The critics blame him for selling French technology to a South Korean company and they also expect massive job losses.
Lagardere said these remarks were not true.
He said that back in February when President Jacques Chirac first mentioned the privatisation, he believed the state was only going to sell Thomson-CSF as part of a defence overhaul.
""But then the Finance Ministry came from behind and integrated Multimedia into the deal,"" Lagardere said.
""So I went to look for partners. I searched in Europe, the U.S., Japan and Korea. I choose Daewoo because I thought they were the best guarantee for jobs, "" he said.
Daewoo Electronics plans to create 5,000 jobs in France at Thomson Multimedia, the world's fourth biggest maker of televisions which employs some 49,500 people world-wide.
""I give my personal guarantee to those (French) jobs. Daewoo has made commitments to the government and to us,"" he said.
While Daewoo is taking over the television and video recorder production activities. Thomson Multimedia's digital television know-how will be put into a special joint-venture.
""We took the technology out of the company and put it in a joint venture (with Daewoo) in which we have 51 percent,"" Lagardere said. While he used the past tense on Saturday, the French Privatisation Commission and European Commission still have to approve the deal, which is scheduled for completion at the end of the year.

29,"Cie Generale des Eaux on Tuesday launched its bid to become the main rival to state-owned France Telecom with the start a fixed telephone network in a residential quarter in the southern city of Nice.
Philippe Glotin, managing director of Generale's telecoms unit Cegetel, said the group aims to have a market share in 2003 yielding 40 billion francs ($7.9 billion) in annual sales, of which more than half would come from mobile communications.
In mobile telecommunications, Generale already competes with France Telecom with its SFR unit and it is allied to British Telecom Plc and MCI for business services.
The local residential market is expected to grow at a moderate pace but nevertheless represent 55 billion francs in 2003.
Glotin said he aimed at gaining a 40 percent share in mobiles, 20 percent in long-distance and 10 percent for so-called local loops, or small networks.
Cegetel, which counts BT, Mannesmann and SBC of the United States among its owners, has received permission from the French authorities for a telecoms experiment in Nice and from the start of 1997 it will offer residential telecoms services, using the DECT technology.
DECT, digitally-enhanced cordless telephone, uses radio waves to connect buildings to a telephone switch, while the connections inside the building are of the classical type using a telephone socket.
DECT is also available in totally wireless versions but the Nice experiment will not use this. DECT can handle high capacities and is relatively secure as far as privacy of calls is concerned.
Glotin said that Nice was the precursor of Cegetel's assault on France Telecom and the company would invest three billion francs in Nice and somewhere in central France to hone its skills ahead of the liberalisation of the market in 1998.
Cegetel is aiming to start its business in some 30 towns which will add up to a population of some 10 million inhabitants.
To part finance this five-year plan, Cegetel shareholders will inject 6.8 billion francs into the company at the start of 1997.
In business services, Cegetel is considering putting a local loop in the La Defense office complex on the Paris outskirts -- where parent Generale des Eaux is the main building developer.
In that area, MFS Communications Ltd already offers business services with a local loop in competition to France Telecom.
Glotin said that the success of Cegetel, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.
Telecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.
""The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,"" Glotin said.
Other future rivals for France Telecom are building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET. Bouygues started France's third mobile telecommunications service earlier this year.

29,"Jacques Maillot, the chairman of travel group Nouvelles Frontieres who dropped out of bidding for French regional airline Air Liberte, is planning to buy airline AOM and expects formal talks to start in weeks.
""I have had several talks with CDR executives and we have started to exchange information,"" Maillot said. ""We have not talked about a price or anything. There is an old valuation by bank Warburgs and I have asked bank Paribas to look at the company,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
AOM, created in 1991 by the merger of Air Outre Mer and Minerve, is owned by the Consortium de Realisation (CDR), a state entity charged with selling former assets of the Credit Lyonnais bank.
Maillot announced on Wednesday he had withdrawn from talks on the rescue Air Liberte, in administration since September 26, because of the size of the financial commitment required.
A 780 million french franc ($151.2 million) bid by British Airways Plc French TAT unit and bank Rivaud is now the only remaining one on the table and expected to be approved by the Creteil commercial court on Friday.
Maillot had planned to buy Air Liberte with the help of Royal Air Maroc, the Moroccan national airline, holiday resorts group Club Mediterranee and Rivaud.
In a second stage he had planned to enlarge his consortium to acquire AOM and merge it with Air Liberte in a big French private company to rival the state-owned Air France group.
""First there will be talks between Paribas and Warburgs, then we will start official talks with CDR,"" Maillot said.
""Because CDR is part of the state there have to be discussions with Bercy (the Finance Ministry) and the privatisation commission,"" he added.
Maillot said Warburg had put a value of one billion francs on AOM but he noted the study was a bit outdated as much had changed in the market since.
A spokesman for the CDR confirmed that there had been informal contacts with Maillot but no formal sale procedure had been started.
""We have had informal contacts,"" Jean-Michel Raingeard, spokesman at the CDR told Reuters. ""But we have not started a sale procedure, which is a very strict procedure,"" he added.
""The financial situation at AOM is better than at many other airlines,"" he said. CDR would only decide to start a sale procedure for AOM ""When we feel that the time is ripe.""
""We always planned to sell AOM at the time of the liberalisation of French airspace (in 1997),"" Raingeard said.
""What we need now is a period of calm. A lot has happened recently and at a quick pace. We need to wait at least a few weeks to see the new lie of the land,"" he said.
This summer, AOM chairman Alexandre Couvelaire had been in talks with Air Liberte chairman and founder Lotfi Belhassine about a merger. But the deteriorating financial situation at Air Liberte led to a break-up of talks.
A spokeswoman for AOM said the company would now go it alone.""There's British Airways, Groupe Air France and us. We have 10 to 12 percent of slots at Orly and we will go it alone,"" she said.

29,"French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull now has the freedom to deal with any other computer group in Europe following the sale of some five percent of its shares held by the government.
Thierry Breton, managing director of Bull, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company still planned to be part of a restructuring of the European computer industry.
""With the support of our private shareholders, we can do that either by a market operation, by a merger or acquisition or by both,"" he said.  
""Rather than to wait for when the opportunity presented itself before doing anything, the shareholders decided to put us in a position so that we can act as a private company when the time is ripe.""
Breton said others involved in the restructuring of the European computer industry included Italy's Olivetti, Philips Electronics of the Netherlands and Siemens AG of Germany.
""There are also the European units of U.S. companies that may be interested in participating in the restructuring,"" he added.  
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the former McKinsey consultant who became chairman in 1993, earlier this year said Bull wanted the state to sell 20 percent to a fourth industrial partner, preferably European, and to financial investors.
Bull returned to profit in 1995 after posting combined losses of 22 billion francs since 1990.
The French government has said it plans to privatise Bull before the end of 1997.
Breton said the state share sale would take place after a capital increase amounting to ""several hundreds of millions of francs.""  
The state will subscribe to its portion of the capital increase, but resell its shares to private investors.
Motorola of the U.S., NEC of Japan and France Telecom, which each have a 17 percent stake, are expected to subscribe to their part.
""They are on our strategic commission. They come here every three months for two days. I think I can say that we have the support of our shareholders,"" Breton said.
IBM, which has 1.6 percent, is not expected to join in the capital increase. It has passed up two previous opportunities.  
Japan's Dai Nippon Printing, with 3.3 percent, has been invited to join the capital increase.
Bull in February effectively withdrew from the personal computer market by merging its Zenith Data division with Packard Bell Electronics Inc.
Breton said the company was standing by its profit forecast of higher profits in 1996 compared with a 306 million profit in 1995, but he declined to confirm the group was aiming for more than 600 million.
""We keep our forecast, we are on line to deliver on our promise,"" Breton said.

29,"French carmakers Renault SA and Peugeot PSA said on Wednesday that they were in talks with the government on a long-term plan to rejuvenate their workforce.
But the companies did not confirm a newspaper report they were seeking approval for a five-year plan to cut 40,000 jobs in an early retirement scheme in exchange for hiring 14,000 young people. Newspaper Les Echos said the cost of these operations could be 30 billion francs ($6 billion).
""Our chairman Louis Schweitzer and Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet have written a letter to Prime Minister Alain Juppe in July with a proposal,"" a Renault spokeswoman said.
""There have been discussions since but the government has not yet replied,"" she added.
At Peugeot, officials declined to comment on the existence of the letter but a spokesman said that the French car industry needed to rejuvenate its work force.
""In France, the average age of a car worker is 42 to 43 years but our competitors, especially Asian, have an average age of below 30 years,"" the Peugeot spokesman said.
He said that this gave Peugeot and Renault a competitive handicap at a time when the markets are increasingly being opened up -- from 1999 a quota system limiting Japanese car imports in Europe will be lifted.
Younger workers are not only cheaper but also more flexible and open to new techniques such as ""empowerment"" - a management idea giving workers more responsibility for their own work, the Peugeot official said.
At Renault the average age is 45 years. ""We have old factories, the oldest is at Flins which dates from the war, and therefore the average age is rather high,"" the Renault spokeswoman said.
Renault had a worldwide staff of 139,950 people at the end of 1995. Of them, 72,163 were involved in car production in France.
At PSA Peugeot Citroen, the group number is 139,900 of whom 122,600 are in car production in France.
French car makers are experiencing difficulties and a two-year government old-for-new car incentive scheme has not helped to overcome market problems.
The French auto industry is hit by increased competition from Asian rivals as well as by the strength of the franc.
Renault expects to end 1995 in the red after posting a net attributable profit of 2.1 billion francs in 1995 while Peugeot reported a drop in first half net attributable profits to 602 million francs against 1.22 billion last year.
Renault is cutting 1,650 jobs in 1996 through early retirement and partial early retirement schemes and will in January start negotiations with its labour unions about the 1997 restructuring plan.
At Peugeot, there is a reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 in the job numbers each year and there too, new negotiations are due to start early 1997.
""French carmakers have a record of trying to adapt to the market conditions without resorting to mass lay-offs, like for instance our German neighbours have done,"" the spokesman said.
