1,"Round one - victory! The government has done the right thing and the dome gets another chance. Other bidders - now suddenly many more - can come forward and suggest something better than a disgraceful fire-sale at a knock-down price to property developers. It would have been the final scandal of the dome's history. The panic that seized the government at the end of last year is over. There is time to stop and think, time to consider every option - ""as long as it takes,"" says Lord Falconer - no artificial deadlines. But will it be saved as a public space? Now the dome is closed, the spate of bad news that hung over it like a thick smog has lifted. Panic was the danger - the same panic that seized governments before. The Festival of Britain of 1951, besieged by many of the same headlines calling it a monstrous waste of public money, was razed to the ground the day it closed to save further public embarrassment. The incoming Conservative government smashed the Skylon to pieces and bulldozed the Dome of Discovery, both icons that would now be loved and revered landmarks. They couldn't move fast enough to pull down the Crystal Palace after the Great Exhibition of 1851 and remove it to a distant suburb where it later burned to the ground. The moment a great public exhibition closes is the moment when it is least fashionable and least valued. Its value plummets so low people can't even see the value of the land around it. By the time the final deal is done, we will look back on the idea of selling this majestic site for a fraction of its true worth with utter incredulity.  Talking to top London property dealers yesterday, they said there had been a phenomenal conspiracy of silence among the five big property companies who stood by and looked on as Legacy seemed about to be given it almost as a gift. ""We could not believe it,"" said one leading estate agent. Why the silence? Well, it was government business and no one wanted to make trouble, with future contracts in mind. But consider this, said one. Canary Wharf is just 40 seconds' travel time from the dome peninsula. Last November the Canary Wharf Group plc acquired a new 6.3-acre tract of land for development in North Canary Wharf called Shed 35. It cost them £53m. That is the same sum Legacy was proposing to put down on 63 similar acres, with just another £75m to follow later. ""The site value   has soared in the past 20 months since bids were first invited. Now there is a tube and infrastructure, it's a different game."" He reckons a full and fair global competition will bring in a sizeable fortune for the site - and still leave plenty of room for publicly owned space.  Now for round two. This spectacular peninsula is the most beautiful piece of undeveloped urban landscape in the capital, surrounded by the Thames on three sides, under a great wide sky with breathtaking views in all directions. Reached by boat and by one of London's most architecturally exciting new tube stations, this is a dream public space, a park, a treasure. Once sold off and built over, it will be gone for ever, unreclaimable for the public. Richard Rogers, architect of this mighty white structure, is one of those who has been fighting hard behind the scenes to keep it as a publicly owned place for ever. If the Skylon, the Dome of Discovery and the Crystal Palace still stood, how extraordinary it would seem now ever to sell them off. If some of the dome land is now sold well, the dome and its park can remain a public place, with no need to sell it, though it might be rented. The day will come - probably soon - when some Olympic or other sporting or cultural event will need the dome in a capital bereft of wonderful sites. The failure of Wembley Stadium plans is just another example of how badly Britain does great national monuments. But now we have a chance to get this right.  The last great dome crisis forced the Millennium Commission angrily to fork out a final £47m last October. But this sum was never actually drawn down. In its last three months, according to one millennium commissioner, increased numbers of visitors meant the dome broke even and never used those final funds that caused such volcanic public fury. The money is there, already given to the dome, and it should be used to help ensure the dome remains a public space. But the real endowment comes from the land around it, sold to create a trust for it in perpetuity.  Richard Rogers has an ambitious vision for the place and is likely to join better developers to propose a scheme for the North Greenwich peninsula that would be a model for the kind of regeneration his Urban Task Force advocates. It would include at least 40% affordable housing for the local community: he has been talking with Peabody and Rowntree about social housing possibilities. It would be a high density cityscape with shops and offices as well as homes, looking on to a leisure park around the dome that would be a national attraction for sports and concerts - run by PY or the BBC/Tussauds group, or any other entertainment consortium. He talks of things built in Barcelona and Amsterdam, and London's terrible past   mistakes. Last time I wrote about the dome, a fair number of emails from around the country complained bitterly at any more public time, money or attention being thrown at this London site. They have a point. It would have been better had the dome been built elsewhere. But there it is now in Greenwich, a national treasure on a site of natural beauty. Huge sums have been wasted, but that is no reason to waste the only good that can come from it.  Rogers points across the water to Canary Wharf, the great emblem of the Thatcher era - all offices, stylish restaurants and expensive houses, a pure property developers' hygienic, anodyne heaven straight from the brochure. It is an eerie place - no children, schools or old people, no workers, beggars, misfits, everything crisp and pricey for its cloned battalions of young professionals, with none of the eccentric, random oddity that breathes real   city life. Now imagine across the water a Labour era development in complete social contrast, a regeneration project as a model for other city schemes.  The question is: does this mark new thinking by Labour? In the early days, how avidly they sought to show they were as friendly to private developers as any conservative government. The tube is the next big question, as bargaining continues ferociously behind the scenes. Gordon Brown, jaw set, says the risk of major construction programmes must all be borne by private companies, despite passionate public opinion in favour of keeping it publicly owned. He ploughs on with the sale of air traffic control too, against the public will. But somewhere in the heart of government, the dome decision may herald the start of a welcome change of attitude for the second term.","In some quarters a faintly blank look of surprise greets news of the Guardian's republican stand. Why bother? Aren't there more pressing matters? Are there no poor children, disaster schools, desperate estates, over-crowded prisons?As the Queen trots down the Mall today in her gilded coach, the speech in her golden reticule will no doubt touch upon all these things. It may be mildly comic when the world's richest woman intones her government's concern over the plight of her less fortunate subjects. But so what? Is it really worth investing in the huge turmoil of trying to remove the monarchy when so much else presses? Yes, it is well worth it. She must be Elizabeth the Last. The tyranny of the monarchy lies less in its temporal than its spiritual power: it tyrannises the imagination. Its spirit permeates political thinking, poisons the appetite for reform and deep dyes the blood of Britain with fantasies of who and what we are. Unconquered, never, never slaves, we are all subject to Britannia the monarch. As our glorious heritage parades again today through London to open parliament, Household Cavalry glinting in the sun, all this empty pageantry of wigs and ermine, britches and sticks promises a better yesterday. It breathes the glory of Good Queen Bess and Bluff King Hal, the Empress of India still ruling a rosy pink globe, our island story on display. Do the marching bands bring a tear to the eye? This is what we do so well!  These bare ruined choirs signify nothing, I used to think - picturesque, harmless, good for tourism. But the trappings are not trivial. They trap us in an infantile fairyland of imaginary heritage. Bogus history fuels present national delusion. Look no further than here for the reason why this country breeds small-minded bigotry, Eurosceptic xenophobia, union flag-painted brutes rampaging at foreign football matches. Why is this country so profoundly conservative, government pollsters ask? Somewhere the answer lies wrapped in the ermine. It is why this country is a recalcitrant bad neighbour in Europe, why it struts and swaggers brazenly despite an economy, a productivity and a social fabric so profoundly inferior to theirs.  The monarchy explains why this country fell behind the rest of Europe after the war, never modernised, never leapt ahead as Germany rose from the ashes. Instead victory enshrined the bad old ways, without change or introspection. The spirit of unconquered monarchy ossified a pre-war class hatred that stopped modern industrial cooperation for the first 30 post-war years. Complacent trust in tradition let others get ahead while we declined. Modernisation was not in our bones in those key years. The rest of Europe started again,   those minor countries with monarchies beginning modern post-war contracts between people and crown. Here, nothing changed. A one-term 1945 Labour government left landmarks such as the National Health Service, but no fundamental break with the past.  Now Britain's 21st century politics are still held back by empty ideas of tradition. Europe - whatever its future construction and membership - is our only destiny and yet British politicians are unable to play a full part, to engage or even to speak the truth about it to a people besotted with the magic word ""sovereignty"". Stymied in Europe by nothing but our own bizarre Ruritanian obsessions, things can't go on like this. Year by year it is crippling us. That word sovereignty has to be wrestled to the ground, exposed, redefined and laid to rest with a people that feels it has lost touch with power. It is their sense of powerlessness that makes them misunderstand Europe and panic at ""losing"" what they have too little of already.  Many regard the monarchy as just the glac&eacute; cherry atop the worm-eaten constitution. Labour has been burrowing away at its foundations, removing props and the whole edifice is tottering. No doubt more props can be found for particular glitches - the West Lothian question, the English parliament question, the House of Lords - but no amount of sticking plaster will patch together those fundamental and well justified fears that power is slipping from the people. Globalisation and worse - the failure of global governance to solve global crises in climate change or trade deals - has inflamed this sense of helplessness. Local government is a vacant lot, Westminster is a one-party state punctuated only by raucous prime minister's questions that shame rational debate. The democratic deficit creates a dangerous cynicism about all politics.   Ironically, the more people disengage from politics, the harder it becomes to persuade them that the constitution matters. Even at the height of debate about a Scottish parliament, very few Scots' pulses raced: Mori found barely 10% put it near the top of their list of concerns. Though if threatened now with losing its parliament, the Scots would rebel, Brave Heart rise from his grave. Powerlessness breeds apathy, but real power excites. So a new constitution for Britain may not burn on all lips in the bus queues. It is a ""chattering classes"" question for now - ""Guardian stuff"" nature's conservatives will say. But once offered a fairer distribution of power, people will seize it.  For the next manifesto Labour should promise a great national constitutional convention out of which to forge something better than this. Put everything into the melting pot, all sources of power, toss in the monarchy, Europe, the regions and above all proportional representation: public interest will ignite. Commission a fine preamble to the   first British constitution and begin again. Already Labour's manifesto will promise a new House of Lords and a referendum on PR. Both these raise basic questions. Both require wide and loud debate, opening everything wide.  The people are there already, if asked. A Rowntree/ICM poll in October found 59% wanting PR for Westminster, even more for local government. First-past-the-post has been well discredited in the US. In Britain at the last election the only views that mattered were 168,000 voters in key marginals - 0.5% of those who voted. The rest might just as well never bother - and many didn't. Many disdain the strictly limited party choice on offer. They dislike having candidates foisted on them. They mistrust the vast power in the hands of a prime minister only a minority has voted for. That dangerous disaffection will erupt more often, as over the fuel protests. People who feel denied a voice will become more febrile when they think a government not altogether legitimate - as no doubt George W Bush will discover. Voting systems need to be aired as part of a whole new constitutional settlement.  This is not an abstract issue. Britain now urgently needs an electorate confident enough in its own power to choose to trade some of it with Europe, to multiply its long-term global power. Ironically, the slipping legitimacy of the British system has given us a prime minister with more absolute power than any since the war, yet unable to deliver on his two great projects - Europe and PR. Our essentially two-party system offers no way to build broad based cross-party consent for difficult fundamental change. Lonely as a medieval monarch surrounded by sycophants, British prime ministers become neurotic, prone to cowardice punctuated by bursts of irrational policy-making: the constitution that brought us the poll tax now brings us privatisation of the London tube.  Fine, but leave the Queen out of it, says the palace. However the monarchy is at the very heart of all this. It is not the ornamental cherry but the rotten core of Britain's decrepit democracy. A good constitution does not guarantee a good country - America's fine words are not matched by good governance. But without a new constitution Britain will be unable to shed the baggage of the ages that hold us back and keep us still the barbarian outpost of Europe. <B>Related stories - news</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - comment</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - background</B><BR>

He ploughs on with the sale of air traffic control too, against the public will. But somewhere in the heart of government, the dome decision may herald the start of a welcome change of attitude for the second term.","In Blandings Castle and Elsewhere, PG Wodehouse recorded the sterling response of Beach, the butler, on discovering Lord Emsworth's son in a drawing room with a sack of rats in his hand. ""With a murmured apology, he secured the sack and started to withdraw. It was not strictly his duty to carry rats, but a good butler is always ready to give and take. Only so can the amenities of a large country house be preserved."" Anyone who has marvelled, in recent days, at the duties routinely performed by Paul Burrell in his days of butling for the Prince and Princess of Wales may find that the Wodehouse passage has lost some of its old impact. They may feel that in comparison with the demands on Burrell's give and take, Beach's was barely tested. For a man, like Burrell, who might, at any time, be ordered to retrieve one of Diana's unwilling lovers from his hiding place in a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet, or have a book thrown at him by Prince Charles as a punishment for second-rate lying, or be despatched to Paddington to stand proxy for the Princess as the saviour of deserving prostitutes, or be sent out by his mistress to buy pornography for her teenage son, the efficient disposal of a sack of rats would probably have presented a nice break from routine. For Burrell's unfortunate colleague, the valet who had to hold Prince Charles's hospital specimen pot while the royal membrum virile pissed into it, rat-securing could only have offered a glimpse of a better, more beautiful life. Of the many unanswered questions currently stacking-up, Sherlock Holmes-fashion, in the wake of the Burrell trial, the most fascinating is not, surely, the issue of why the Queen dallied so long before springing Burrell from the witness box, nor why our senior police investigators are so spectacularly thick, nor what possessed Burrell to remove boxes of old pop CDs, as well as letters, from proximity to those beastly shredding Spencers, but the far more intriguing subject of the Windsors' execrable treatment of their servants. How have they got away with it for so long?  Naturally, confidentiality agreements and the official secrets act have been helpful to the feudal tradition. Had it not been for Burrell's trial, Prince Charles must have felt quite confident that no one would find out that fibbing to his wife formed part of the Highgrove butler's job description. Wendy Berry, who wrote an engrossing account of her servitude at Highgrove (and one which was rather kinder, though otherwise consistent with the subsequently published recollections of Ken Wharfe, the detective, and Patrick Jephson, Diana's secretary) had to flee to America after Prince Charles took out an injunction on her book, one which remains in place, ensuring that no part of it can be quoted. But even with this legal deterrent to gossip, it is remarkable how little, until now, has been disclosed by their servants about the preposterous expectations and demands of members of the royal family.  Most people will have waited until the Burrell trial to discover that Prince Charles is notorious not only for temper tantrums but for the ludicrous and time-wasting requirement, like a child who cannot leave the house without her comfort blanket, that his personal arrangements, even in hospital, should replicate those at Highgrove. Thanks to Burrell, we now know that for the heir to the throne, there can be no disruption without a van-load of transitional objects. Also that this ardent believer in the dignity of mankind prefers, when at home, to recreate the social arrangements of Altman's satire, Gosford Park - a film, incidentally, which Charles has screened for guests at Sandringham: quality in the comfy chairs, servants in the hard ones at the back. Perhaps they were lucky. The Queen, by Burrell's account, prefers the lower orders to stand in her presence, even when, as in his own, notorious case, their encounter lasts for three hours.  As for these bullied butlers and dressers, valets and housemaids, only proximity to power - and, of course, the free accommodation - can explain why so many are content to indulge their masters, remaining mutely loyal, infinitely discreet. For Burrell, Diana's intimacy and trust must have compensated for the dignity he forfeited when she appointed him Rock of the Bedchamber, a sort of gentleman-procurer responsible for delivering her lovers, stowed in a car boot, in and out of Kensington Palace. Similarly, his sovereign's abrupt recollection of their chat - ""the Queen came through for me"" - seems instantly to have made up for her two years of forgetfulness. Those who now condemn Burrell for telling his story should perhaps marvel instead at his forbearance during the many years of being pelted with books by the heir apparent and besieged by out-of-hours calls from the moody princess while unwanted presents from colonial visitors stoked the Highgrove bonfires. Moreover, even as they add to the gaiety of nations, the Burrell confessions may effect some improvement in palace working conditions. Next time some troublesome Helot has him reaching for the nearest, book-shaped missile, the Prince of Wales may want to think twice, and send for a rat sack instead."

The moment a great public exhibition closes is the moment when it is least fashionable and least valued. Its value plummets so low people can't even see the value of the land around it. By the time the final deal is done, we will look back on the idea of selling this majestic site for a fraction of its true worth with utter incredulity.  Talking to top London property dealers yesterday, they said there had been a phenomenal conspiracy of silence among the five big property companies who stood by and looked on as Legacy seemed about to be given it almost as a gift. ""We could not believe it,"" said one leading estate agent. Why the silence? Well, it was government business and no one wanted to make trouble, with future contracts in mind. But consider this, said one. Canary Wharf is just 40 seconds' travel time from the dome peninsula. Last November the Canary Wharf Group plc acquired a new 6.3-acre tract of land for development in North Canary Wharf called Shed 35. It cost them £53m. That is the same sum Legacy was proposing to put down on 63 similar acres, with just another £75m to follow later. ""The site value   has soared in the past 20 months since bids were first invited. Now there is a tube and infrastructure, it's a different game."" He reckons a full and fair global competition will bring in a sizeable fortune for the site - and still leave plenty of room for publicly owned space.  Now for round two. This spectacular peninsula is the most beautiful piece of undeveloped urban landscape in the capital, surrounded by the Thames on three sides, under a great wide sky with breathtaking views in all directions. Reached by boat and by one of London's most architecturally exciting new tube stations, this is a dream public space, a park, a treasure. Once sold off and built over, it will be gone for ever, unreclaimable for the public. Richard Rogers, architect of this mighty white structure, is one of those who has been fighting hard behind the scenes to keep it as a publicly owned place for ever. If the Skylon, the Dome of Discovery and the Crystal Palace still stood, how extraordinary it would seem now ever to sell them off. If some of the dome land is now sold well, the dome and its park can remain a public place, with no need to sell it, though it might be rented. The day will come - probably soon - when some Olympic or other sporting or cultural event will need the dome in a capital bereft of wonderful sites. The failure of Wembley Stadium plans is just another example of how badly Britain does great national monuments. But now we have a chance to get this right.  The last great dome crisis forced the Millennium Commission angrily to fork out a final £47m last October. But this sum was never actually drawn down. In its last three months, according to one millennium commissioner, increased numbers of visitors meant the dome broke even and never used those final funds that caused such volcanic public fury. The money is there, already given to the dome, and it should be used to help ensure the dome remains a public space. But the real endowment comes from the land around it, sold to create a trust for it in perpetuity.  Richard Rogers has an ambitious vision for the place and is likely to join better developers to propose a scheme for the North Greenwich peninsula that would be a model for the kind of regeneration his Urban Task Force advocates. It would include at least 40% affordable housing for the local community: he has been talking with Peabody and Rowntree about social housing possibilities. It would be a high density cityscape with shops and offices as well as homes, looking on to a leisure park around the dome that would be a national attraction for sports and concerts - run by PY or the BBC/Tussauds group, or any other entertainment consortium. He talks of things built in Barcelona and Amsterdam, and London's terrible past   mistakes. Last time I wrote about the dome, a fair number of emails from around the country complained bitterly at any more public time, money or attention being thrown at this London site. They have a point. It would have been better had the dome been built elsewhere. But there it is now in Greenwich, a national treasure on a site of natural beauty. Huge sums have been wasted, but that is no reason to waste the only good that can come from it.  Rogers points across the water to Canary Wharf, the great emblem of the Thatcher era - all offices, stylish restaurants and expensive houses, a pure property developers' hygienic, anodyne heaven straight from the brochure. It is an eerie place - no children, schools or old people, no workers, beggars, misfits, everything crisp and pricey for its cloned battalions of young professionals, with none of the eccentric, random oddity that breathes real   city life. Now imagine across the water a Labour era development in complete social contrast, a regeneration project as a model for other city schemes.  The question is: does this mark new thinking by Labour? In the early days, how avidly they sought to show they were as friendly to private developers as any conservative government. The tube is the next big question, as bargaining continues ferociously behind the scenes. Gordon Brown, jaw set, says the risk of major construction programmes must all be borne by private companies, despite passionate public opinion in favour of keeping it publicly owned. He ploughs on with the sale of air traffic control too, against the public will. But somewhere in the heart of government, the dome decision may herald the start of a welcome change of attitude for the second term."
0,"In some quarters a faintly blank look of surprise greets news of the Guardian's republican stand. Why bother? Aren't there more pressing matters? Are there no poor children, disaster schools, desperate estates, over-crowded prisons?As the Queen trots down the Mall today in her gilded coach, the speech in her golden reticule will no doubt touch upon all these things. It may be mildly comic when the world's richest woman intones her government's concern over the plight of her less fortunate subjects. But so what? Is it really worth investing in the huge turmoil of trying to remove the monarchy when so much else presses? Yes, it is well worth it. She must be Elizabeth the Last. The tyranny of the monarchy lies less in its temporal than its spiritual power: it tyrannises the imagination. Its spirit permeates political thinking, poisons the appetite for reform and deep dyes the blood of Britain with fantasies of who and what we are. Unconquered, never, never slaves, we are all subject to Britannia the monarch. As our glorious heritage parades again today through London to open parliament, Household Cavalry glinting in the sun, all this empty pageantry of wigs and ermine, britches and sticks promises a better yesterday. It breathes the glory of Good Queen Bess and Bluff King Hal, the Empress of India still ruling a rosy pink globe, our island story on display. Do the marching bands bring a tear to the eye? This is what we do so well!  These bare ruined choirs signify nothing, I used to think - picturesque, harmless, good for tourism. But the trappings are not trivial. They trap us in an infantile fairyland of imaginary heritage. Bogus history fuels present national delusion. Look no further than here for the reason why this country breeds small-minded bigotry, Eurosceptic xenophobia, union flag-painted brutes rampaging at foreign football matches. Why is this country so profoundly conservative, government pollsters ask? Somewhere the answer lies wrapped in the ermine. It is why this country is a recalcitrant bad neighbour in Europe, why it struts and swaggers brazenly despite an economy, a productivity and a social fabric so profoundly inferior to theirs.  The monarchy explains why this country fell behind the rest of Europe after the war, never modernised, never leapt ahead as Germany rose from the ashes. Instead victory enshrined the bad old ways, without change or introspection. The spirit of unconquered monarchy ossified a pre-war class hatred that stopped modern industrial cooperation for the first 30 post-war years. Complacent trust in tradition let others get ahead while we declined. Modernisation was not in our bones in those key years. The rest of Europe started again,   those minor countries with monarchies beginning modern post-war contracts between people and crown. Here, nothing changed. A one-term 1945 Labour government left landmarks such as the National Health Service, but no fundamental break with the past.  Now Britain's 21st century politics are still held back by empty ideas of tradition. Europe - whatever its future construction and membership - is our only destiny and yet British politicians are unable to play a full part, to engage or even to speak the truth about it to a people besotted with the magic word ""sovereignty"". Stymied in Europe by nothing but our own bizarre Ruritanian obsessions, things can't go on like this. Year by year it is crippling us. That word sovereignty has to be wrestled to the ground, exposed, redefined and laid to rest with a people that feels it has lost touch with power. It is their sense of powerlessness that makes them misunderstand Europe and panic at ""losing"" what they have too little of already.  Many regard the monarchy as just the glac&eacute; cherry atop the worm-eaten constitution. Labour has been burrowing away at its foundations, removing props and the whole edifice is tottering. No doubt more props can be found for particular glitches - the West Lothian question, the English parliament question, the House of Lords - but no amount of sticking plaster will patch together those fundamental and well justified fears that power is slipping from the people. Globalisation and worse - the failure of global governance to solve global crises in climate change or trade deals - has inflamed this sense of helplessness. Local government is a vacant lot, Westminster is a one-party state punctuated only by raucous prime minister's questions that shame rational debate. The democratic deficit creates a dangerous cynicism about all politics.   Ironically, the more people disengage from politics, the harder it becomes to persuade them that the constitution matters. Even at the height of debate about a Scottish parliament, very few Scots' pulses raced: Mori found barely 10% put it near the top of their list of concerns. Though if threatened now with losing its parliament, the Scots would rebel, Brave Heart rise from his grave. Powerlessness breeds apathy, but real power excites. So a new constitution for Britain may not burn on all lips in the bus queues. It is a ""chattering classes"" question for now - ""Guardian stuff"" nature's conservatives will say. But once offered a fairer distribution of power, people will seize it.  For the next manifesto Labour should promise a great national constitutional convention out of which to forge something better than this. Put everything into the melting pot, all sources of power, toss in the monarchy, Europe, the regions and above all proportional representation: public interest will ignite. Commission a fine preamble to the   first British constitution and begin again. Already Labour's manifesto will promise a new House of Lords and a referendum on PR. Both these raise basic questions. Both require wide and loud debate, opening everything wide.  The people are there already, if asked. A Rowntree/ICM poll in October found 59% wanting PR for Westminster, even more for local government. First-past-the-post has been well discredited in the US. In Britain at the last election the only views that mattered were 168,000 voters in key marginals - 0.5% of those who voted. The rest might just as well never bother - and many didn't. Many disdain the strictly limited party choice on offer. They dislike having candidates foisted on them. They mistrust the vast power in the hands of a prime minister only a minority has voted for. That dangerous disaffection will erupt more often, as over the fuel protests. People who feel denied a voice will become more febrile when they think a government not altogether legitimate - as no doubt George W Bush will discover. Voting systems need to be aired as part of a whole new constitutional settlement.  This is not an abstract issue. Britain now urgently needs an electorate confident enough in its own power to choose to trade some of it with Europe, to multiply its long-term global power. Ironically, the slipping legitimacy of the British system has given us a prime minister with more absolute power than any since the war, yet unable to deliver on his two great projects - Europe and PR. Our essentially two-party system offers no way to build broad based cross-party consent for difficult fundamental change. Lonely as a medieval monarch surrounded by sycophants, British prime ministers become neurotic, prone to cowardice punctuated by bursts of irrational policy-making: the constitution that brought us the poll tax now brings us privatisation of the London tube.  Fine, but leave the Queen out of it, says the palace. However the monarchy is at the very heart of all this. It is not the ornamental cherry but the rotten core of Britain's decrepit democracy. A good constitution does not guarantee a good country - America's fine words are not matched by good governance. But without a new constitution Britain will be unable to shed the baggage of the ages that hold us back and keep us still the barbarian outpost of Europe. <B>Related stories - news</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - comment</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - background</B><BR>
<BR><BR><BR>  <BR>  <B>Talk about it</B><BR>  <B>Interactive</B><BR>  <BR>    <B>Useful links</B><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>","Tony Martin should never have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Punishing the Norfolk farmer in this way is an outrage. It offends any sane person's instincts about the meaning of justice. On the spectrum of heinous murders it places Martin at the same point as the Yorkshire Ripper, which is plainly unacceptable. All murderers do not weigh the same in the scales of human wickedness, yet we discover that they are equal before the law. Something very wrong is happening to a man who went too far, with a terrible result, in defending himself and his property. It is obvious, therefore, that politicians should be heard from. They have a duty to say what they would do not only for Martin but for others in similar situations. William Hague had a go at doing that yesterday. Very naturally there has been an outcry, and you don't have to be a Daily Mail reader to experience the indignation that produces it. But one does need to take a little care. Ends and means bear some examination. The very same political instincts that drive Mr Hague to lash out in all directions are the ones that sent Martin to jail for life. Politicians, especially Tory politicians, are accomplices before the fact of the outrage that has now occurred.  For Martin got his life sentence because the judge had no option but to impose it. Ever since the abolition of capital punishment, life has been mandatory for murder. This was the political sweetener that got rid of the gallows, a necessary reassurance to the public at that revolutionary penal moment.  But as the gallows receded, the weakness of the mandatory life sentence became clearer, precisely for the reason that it fails to distinguish between the Ripper and the farmer. By lumping all murders together, it reduces recognition of what is truly heinous, and nullifies the grades of stigma between a desperate act of domestic violence and contract murders by a professional killer.  Over the years, there has been a build-up of studies and reports with detailed argument showing that life should be a maximum and not a mandatory sentence for murder. It would not only be fairer but more effective. The Butler committee said so in 1975, the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1978, the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group in 1986, a House of Lords select committee in 1989. All lord chief justices in living memory have thought that a judge was no less qualified to exercise discretion in murder cases than in others, and to determine a fixed sentence appropriate to the case - retaining life only for the very worst.  If this collective wisdom had been followed, Tony Martin would now be serving a proper and not a repugnant sentence for murder. But the wisdom was spurned by politicians. Although it acquired critical mass in the Tory years, no home secretary would listen to it. David Waddington said removing mandatory life would ""greatly damage public confidence"". Kenneth Baker said that all murder, whatever the circumstances, was more abhorrent than any other crime. Douglas Hurd, an aspirant reformer, said it was impossible to get away from the politics of it. None of them paid attention to their colleague, Lord Chancellor Hailsham, who scorned the mandatory life rule and what he called the ""hairy heel of populism"" that made it apparently untouchable.   The Martin case could be used as a unique moment to turn the hairy heel to advantage. Isn't it the best proof yet available of how mandatory life sentences can offend popular instincts? Couldn't the thorny issues of what is appropriate self-defence and what is reasonable force be dealt with, after the jury has spoken, precisely by the judicial discretion that the mandatory sentence takes away? If, as the tabloids and the Tories scream, a better balance must be struck between wicked criminals and overheated householders with a gun to hand, isn't reform of the blanket life sentence by far the most sensible way to do it?   Not to William Hague. Nor to Jack Straw - though abolishing mandatory life is another penal reform Labour once favoured but now rejects. Instead Hague finds the conventional populist appeal irresistible, and overlooks the penal failures it incessantly produced during the Thatcher-Howard years. In 1996, after all, Michael Howard produced mandatory minimum three-year sentences for persistent domestic burglars, which didn't do much good to Tony Martin. A decade of answering what Hague now righteously calls ""an explosion of anger among millions of law abiding people"" with explosions of anger by ranting politicians had limited success in crime-reduction, and still less in restoring to society a hard sense of the difference between right and wrong.  There are many reasons for that failure: moral decline, godless materialism, social neglect, personal indifference, a duty-free society. For vigilante-ism to be written into law, the remedy Hague comes close to proposing, is insupportable, but people must be able, within the law, to defend themselves proportionately to the threat they face. Martin had an illegal weapon, and committed a shocking crime. The issue is the context, especially the legal context, in which this should henceforth be dealt with. There are sharply contrasting possibilities.  The politicians' way is to pass sweeping laws of ever greater crudity. These are what have put Tony Martin in jail for life, and Hague   wants more of them. They reject individual justice, in favour of grand statements that brush aside particulars. They may catch some serious criminals and send them down for a long time, but people of minor as well as major evil are caught in a penal regime which, more and more over the past decade, has promoted political over judicial decision-making. Life sentences, with discretion over the real time served given to the home secretary, are a burgeoning phenomenon of the British system, now extending well beyond murder. They undermine the notion of justice as a juridical not a political commodity, applying to people not to categories, addressing real lives and not tabloid furies.  The judges' way is different. The judge uses his judgment in all the circum- stances. He can look at Tony Martin and see he's not one of the Krays. Restoring his power to discriminate between one murderer and another would restore justice without imperilling social order in any way. Judges can be as hard as politicians, but aren't locked into a system that guarantees injustice. Actually, they will get their power back. As the Bulger case showed, political intervention in sentencing is beginning to seep away, because it violates the European human rights convention. This will retrieve some sanity. But not before the Martin case has sent politicians raging in the wrong direction.  <A"
1,"For loyal followers of Prince Charles's career, Mark Bolland's statement only confirmed something that became evident years ago, even before Jonathan Dimbleby's biography and television documentary introduced us to the suffering, misunderstood outsider who is our future king. As long ago as 1982, in one of my favourite Prince Charles speeches (in which he lectured the BMA on the benefits of healing), our embryonic dissident anticipated disapproval with a short digression about the role of the intellectual outcast, reminding the doctors of the persecution of the 16th-century physician, Paracelsus: ""He is probably remembered more for his fight against orthodoxy than for his achievements in the medical field. As a result of his unorthodox approach to medicine in his time, he was equated with the damnable Dr Faustus.""Such, the doctors gathered, was Charles's estimation of his own, heretical role. ""Perhaps,"" he told them, ""we just have to accept it is God's will that the unorthodox individual is doomed to years of frustration, ridicule and failure in order to act out his role in the scheme of things, until his day arrives and man-kind is ready to receive his message ...""Later, he appears to have extended this analysis to include the obstacles to popularity faced (though now, mercifully overcome) by his mistress; certainly he could be heard telling her in the Camillagate tape, ""You suffer all these indignities and tortures and calumnies."" By this time, it seems, the prince had come to feel that his sufferings so far surpassed the occasional comparison with Dr Faustus as to approach the trauma of contemporary political dissidents.Bolland's evidence, together with the extracts from the Chinese Takeaway diary, also suggest that, since styling himself a medico-mystical sort of seer, doomed to suffer the mockery of the ignorant for possessing insights whose truth would only be revealed long after his death (when they'd all be sorry), Prince Charles has developed into a roving, proactive campaigner for human rights, more along the lines of a one-man Amnesty International. And a campaigner, incidentally, who knows what it is to be spied on, followed, and publicly denounced in his struggle to win freedom of speech for the hereditary monarchy.This is the unafraid, outspoken dissident who refused to dine with President Jiang Zemin, out of solidarity for the Dalai Lama, and determined that this deliberate snub should be advertised in the press, where the Chinese delegation would read it - and either fume with frustrated social ambition, or renounce their claim to Tibet.And this is the outspoken dissident who is also a close ally and companion of the rulers of Saudi Arabia, where, as he is presumably aware, many of the liberties he craves for the oppressed Chinese are routinely denied to subjects of the Saud dynasty. Possibly, he prefers the Arab rulers' noble, hawk-carrying look to that of the yellow-tinged Chinese ""waxworks"" in their ill-fitting suits. Or it could be a question of artistic affinity. In 2001 Charles and Prince Khalid al-Faisal held a joint exhibition of their paintings; watercolour prince reaching out to oil-painting prince, across the human rights divide. Unless it is the very different feel of human rights violations, when they are imposed by a hereditary monarch who has been educated at an English public school. If so, this would explain Charles's trip to Bhutan, a few years ago, where the torture and ethnic cleansing of Nepalese speakers did not prevent him enjoying hours in the company of the absolute monarch, King Wangchuck.What manner of dissident, then, does Prince Charles aspire to be? He travels too much to have a lot in common with Aung San Suu Kyi, and while his zeal for writing letters betrays some affinity with the late Mary Whitehouse, the astonishing range of his known interventions (one senses the existence of many more, of which we remain unaware) - medicine, China, history teaching, architecture, GM foods, Shakespeare, the compensation culture, religion, farming, hunting, cancer care, nano-technology, mutton, political correctness gone mad - makes him more reminiscent, surely, of Gandhi, whose unorthodoxies also extended beyond revolutionary political thinking to embrace spirituality, morality, dietary restrictions, and dress.True, Gandhi is indelibly associated with non-violence and sexual restraint, while the Prince has been known to throw books and wrench washbasins off walls, but in their shared sense of destiny, their search for the truth, ambitions for their country, and strict rules about what to eat for breakfast, the two might be spiritual brothers, each filled with a profound sense of mission to do what is right. ""You have to stand against the whole world although you may have to stand alone,"" Gandhi said. ""You have to stare in the face the whole world although the world may look at you with blood-shot eyes. Do not fear. Trust the little voice residing within your heart."" Or, as it might be, sitting on your throne.It could be, of course, that when he inherits, the Prince plans at once to abandon controversy, emulating instead his stoical mother, who this week received at the palace - with her habitual lack of complaint - a reception for expatriate Australians including Clive James, Germaine Greer, and her old tormentor, Rolf Harris. But given the prince's existing commitment to saying the unsayable on any subject from grey goo to the power of coffee enemas, the acquisition of a throne seems more likely to inspire still greater flights of unfettered self-expression. At liberty to snub or flatter any political leader he chooses, King Charles III will be free to invite the entire Saudi royal family to hunt in St James's Park, to commission Quinlan Terry to beautify both the interior and facade of Buckingham Palace with ornamental pineapples, and - once a week! - to introduce prime ministers as yet unborn to the mysteries of integrated medicine, before reading to them, for hours at a time, from Shakespeare's Henry V or the King James Bible. There will no mummy to glare at him, no daddy to mock him, and more importantly, no interfering little Bollands where there should be only pleasing and agreeable favourites. No one will dare implore him to avoid controversy and ludicrous contradictions (such as helicopter travel and lectures on global warming). Mankind, in short, will be ready to receive his message. He will be our first absolute dissident.","B> Why have we read so little about David Blunkett in recent days? </B><BR> Rightly or wrongly, many newspapers have taken the view that Blunkett and his latest crime-busting initiative are of less immediate interest to their readers than the scandal which now threatens to engulf the royal family - for another week, at least.  <B> What scandal is that? </B> <BR>To summarise, one which depicts many members of the royal family, both nuclear and extended, as callous, feuding, screwed-up and, more interestingly, as potential perverters of the course of justice. Their servants, warring cliques of voracious, sometimes vicious sycophants who hail from an impressively wide range of the sexual spectrum, are also no better than they should be.   <B> Says who? </B><BR> Everyone, really. Paul Burrell, the butler, who was generally acclaimed, before he became the country's most reviled tittle-tattler, as ""the man Diana called her rock"", insists that the Spencers, who wanted to ""crush the rock"", are grasping hypocrites. His - possibly former - friend, Rosa Monckton, added that they had cheated Diana's godchildren out of their inheritance. Meanwhile, his own enemies, who include a former (male) Australian lover and the divorced gay comedian, Michael Barrymore, insist that the butler - who is married, with two children - is himself untrustworthy, having airbrushed a strenuous-sounding gay past from his CV.   <B> Is homosexuality compulsory for royal servants? </B><BR> On the contrary. In the Kensington closets the princess's cast-off clothes competed for space with happily married fathers of two.   <B> What has the royal yacht Britannia got to do with it? </B><BR> According to some uncharitable reports, Burrell was aboard during an incident involving a number of crew members, royal staff and a quantity of gay pornography. It was after this that the queen reportedly advised him that he might find himself a wife.   <B> And how is that remotely relevant to the truth or otherwise of Burrel's disclosures? </B> <BR>Beats me.   <B> Worse things happen at sea, don't they? </B> <BR>And on land too. This weekend George Smith, a former colleague of the butler (divorced, two children) joined in the general unburdening, confiding to the Mail on Sunday that he was the victim of a homosexual rape, allegedly enacted by a trusted royal servant (married, two children) of Prince Charles (divorced, two children). Snaking out of these accusations and counter accusations is another rumour of a sexual encounter said to be so compromising that it could jeopardise the future of the royal family. Then again, they were saying that 10 years ago, after the Camilla tape, but even the Italians no longer call Charles Tamponcino.   <B> How did it start? </B> <BR>With a police raid in January 2001. Officers led by the top vertigo-sufferer, Maxine de Brunner, knocked up Burrell at dawn, reportedly demanding to know the whereabouts of ""the crown jewels"".   <B> Was there any evidence Burrell had profited from theft? </B> <BR>The police, unaware of his work as a media etiquette expert, believed his earnings were dishonestly acquired.    <B> How could they be so stupid? </B><BR> Or determined. We must surmise, like the queen, that there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge.   <B> When were the crown jewels moved to Runcorn? </B><BR> Don't be obtuse. It can't have escaped even Guardian readers that the ""crown jewels"" we are talking about here are the contents of an initialled box in which Diana had hidden a variety of potentially incriminating treasures, including letters from Prince Philip calling her a ""trollop"", ex-lover James Hewitt's signet ring and a tape she had recorded (apparently, after plying him with drink), of one servant recalling his alleged rape by another. This box, which seems to have been almost as magically accommodating as Pandora's, may also have contained video diaries of the princess making more unflattering accusations about her in-laws.  <B> Who filmed her? </B><BR> Possibly Martin Bashir, who served the Princesss for a while in a junior-rock-like capacity. This apparently ended after he vouchsafed, somewhat incautiously, to Burrell, that he would ""like to give her one"".  <B> Regina v Burrell: </B><BR> When Burrell appeared at the high court, charged with the theft of 342 comically disparate objects, the judge, Mrs Justice Rafferty, did her utmost to safeguard the reputation of Regina and Co by censoring documents in court, but the case immediately offered treasurable, if pitiable glimpses of the sort of relationship Princess Diana had enjoyed with her family. Her brother, hero of the funeral, who has made the dead Diana into a successful tourist attraction, had previously refused her use of a house on his land, fearing invasion of his privacy. There might have been more, but the case against Burrell collapsed just before he was due to give evidence, Regina having suddenly recalled a conversation with Burrell, in which he had told her he would remove papers for safe-keeping.  <B> Why didn't she intervene earlier? </B><BR> Odd, isn't it? Perhaps there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge.  <B> And the Spencers? </B><BR> One possible explanation for both the royals and the Spencers's carelessness in allowing that gossip-seeking missile, Burrell the chance to detonate in court, was that all the parties involved were engaged, in what, thanks to the concluding scene of Quentin Tarantino's film, Reservoir Dogs, we recognise as a Mexican Standoff. Both the royals and the Spencers, presumably aware of his gay past, may have hoped that Burrell's own sense of self-preservation would deter him from revealing unpalatable truths about them. But it didn't, and all have now had their reputations battered.   <B> Why? </B><BR> Partly because Burrell, who may not, after all, be terribly bright, failed to grasp that discretion (though less cathartic than a £300,000 deal with the Mirror) would be both safer and more lucrative than confession. Partly because it was too late. As well as the revelations about the Spencers offered in open court, a signed legal statement by Burrell written to prove his rock-like status with the princess, had already been leaked to the press, disclosing that his extensive duties included smuggling her lovers, such as Dr Hasnat Khan, in and out of the palace, as well as buying pornography for her son and conveying her donations to prostitutes at Paddington Station.  <B> What very discreet prostitutes. </B> <BR>Absolutely. At a time when even royal servants seem to have forgotten their sacred duty of silence, how reassuring to find that in some professions at least, there is still some regard for decency and discretion. They are an example to us all.  <B> Who was Dr Armani? </B><BR> This mystery American, who used often to interrupt Hasnat Khan as he laboured over an open heart, turns out to be have been the Princess of Wales, using one of her amusing aliases. It was another trick of the fun-loving princess's to tease the public by buying pregnancy tests in Boots. Burrell further disclosed that ""Dr Armani"" once went out to see Khan wearing only her jewellery and a fur coat. He did not disclose whether it was the same evening that Diana threw an unwanted fur coat out of her car-window, aiming it at another of those immensely discreet beggar-women who inhabit the streets of London, but we must hope not. As Bagehot says, it is not good to let daylight in on magic. Especially on a chilly evening. At home, the adaptable Burrell would also prepare easily regurgitated food such as custard and rice pudding for his mistress. Khan appears to have preferred Kentucky Fried Chicken, so much so that Burrell would often find him hiding - vainly, for Diana was nothing if not persistent - in the Colonel's Fulham outlet.   <B> Is that what rocks do? </B><BR> There seems to be no precise job description. In court, Frances Shand Kydd claimed that her daughter had a quite a collection of rocks - so many, you gathered, that if she had only scattered a few hardy alpines between them and placed them on a south-facing terrace, they might have taken a prize at the Chelsea Flower Show. Since then, a positive avalanche of self-styled rocks has suggested that if Burrell was principal boulder, he was surrounded by some very prominent pebbles.  <B> Still, hardly a constitutional crisis. </B><BR> If you believe Tony Blair. But Burrell also confirmed that there was, indeed, a ""rape tape"" in existence, ditto a victim, and possibly evidence of a palace cover-up. Not to mention a perpetrator.  <B> Charges presumably nullified by the butler's own economy with the truth? </B><BR> Not necessarily. His principal challenger is Michael Barrymore, who claimed, ""Paul Burrell seduced me as Diana lay dead.""  <B> Every seduction since September 1 1997 has taken place with Diana lying dead. </B><BR> True, and it should be remembered that Barrymore, whose own reputation has yet to recover from the mysterious death of a young man in his swimming pool, is not generally renowned for the peerless quality of his testimony. His ex-wife, recording her suffering in a new book, recalled ""He was out of his head on drugs at Di's funeral.""  <B> What part did Daniella Westbrook play in all this? </B><BR> Due to some tabloid oversight, there are still a few celebrity names missing from What the Butler Saw, but this is sure to have been corrected by the end of the week.  <B> Why are some newspapers suddenly so interested an obscure royal servant called Michael Fawcett? </B><BR> Apparently because of concerns over his role in selling unwanted gifts received by the Prince of Wales. ""Fawcett the Fence"", as he is reportedly refered to by some colleagues, appears in a much used photograph of the Prince of Wales taken while shooting at Sandringham.  <B> Do people really still wear trousers like that? </B><BR> Apparently.  <B> This doesn't quite explain the intensity of their interest in him does it? </B><BR> Possibly not.  <B> Does any of this actually matter? </B><BR> There are three schools of thought.  <B> 1 The long view. </B><BR> Endorsed by none other than royal biographer, Ben Pimlott, who has dismissed the whole thing as ""boring, frankly"", this school thinks we should all grow up. The Butler-fest only tells us something we already knew: we are abjectly in thrall to celebrity gossip. As for constitutional significance: how, the long-viewers say, can this little of bit palace unpleasantness possibly compare with the sexual and fiscal vagaries of Charles II, the trials of Queen Caroline, the deeply felt hostility towards that goody goody, Queen Victoria? Besides, if you want a royal family, why complain that they're not like decent ordinary folk? Plotting, bossing and showing-off is what they are for.  <B> 2 The short view. </B><BR> Endorsed by almost everyone else, this school holds it to be self-evident that the whole Burrell affair, having multiplied our knowledge of the private life of the royal family by about 1,000 times in two weeks, is necessarily fascinating. And where are the tapes?  <B> 3 The exalted view. </B><BR> Goes ""I'm not interested in the individuals, so much as the institution. If only we could put all this infantilising, prurient rubbish behind us, and engage in a really exciting debate about what a detailed constitution for a republic might look like ...Did she really go out in fur coat with nothing under it?""  <B> When was that glorious jubilee? </B><BR> June 5 was the day of the flypast. Remember? Many republicans and doubters, among them Ros Wynne Jones of the Mirror, accepted that, whatever you might say about them, the royal family truly is for ever. ""My republican dream was shattered"", wrote Ros. Watching the flypast, she thought, the queen must have realised ""that the celebrations were not just for the last 50 years but for the next 50, during which her family were now guaranteed to remain at the heart of public life"". Only a few months later, it looks as if Ros's arithmetic might have been a bit out. ""It is not Paul Burrell whose reputation is seriously under attack"", the Mirror wrote yesterday, ""but that of the Royal Family and their advisors"". Maybe it was the sight of the planes, rather than the royals, that misted up our eyes.  <B> So how about another flypast? </B><BR> Assuming that the queen, Charles, and Philip were actually on board the planes, it might just work. But best wait, perhaps, until Princess Anne has appeared in court to answer for Eglantyne Jebb, her devil dog, to save her having to catch up later.   <B> Are there any winners? </B><BR> Kentucky Fried Chicken? After all, if top heart surgeons eat it, it can't be all that bad.   <B> And the biggest losers? </B><BR> Last week, by common consent, it was the man whose sense of duty drove him to hold Prince Charles's specimen bottle. Only now is it dawning that according to the arcane, below-stairs rituals of the royal household, such a task might be considered a privilege. So it's the bottle I feel for. And those poor little princes."
0,"For loyal followers of Prince Charles's career, Mark Bolland's statement only confirmed something that became evident years ago, even before Jonathan Dimbleby's biography and television documentary introduced us to the suffering, misunderstood outsider who is our future king. As long ago as 1982, in one of my favourite Prince Charles speeches (in which he lectured the BMA on the benefits of healing), our embryonic dissident anticipated disapproval with a short digression about the role of the intellectual outcast, reminding the doctors of the persecution of the 16th-century physician, Paracelsus: ""He is probably remembered more for his fight against orthodoxy than for his achievements in the medical field. As a result of his unorthodox approach to medicine in his time, he was equated with the damnable Dr Faustus.""Such, the doctors gathered, was Charles's estimation of his own, heretical role. ""Perhaps,"" he told them, ""we just have to accept it is God's will that the unorthodox individual is doomed to years of frustration, ridicule and failure in order to act out his role in the scheme of things, until his day arrives and man-kind is ready to receive his message ...""Later, he appears to have extended this analysis to include the obstacles to popularity faced (though now, mercifully overcome) by his mistress; certainly he could be heard telling her in the Camillagate tape, ""You suffer all these indignities and tortures and calumnies."" By this time, it seems, the prince had come to feel that his sufferings so far surpassed the occasional comparison with Dr Faustus as to approach the trauma of contemporary political dissidents.Bolland's evidence, together with the extracts from the Chinese Takeaway diary, also suggest that, since styling himself a medico-mystical sort of seer, doomed to suffer the mockery of the ignorant for possessing insights whose truth would only be revealed long after his death (when they'd all be sorry), Prince Charles has developed into a roving, proactive campaigner for human rights, more along the lines of a one-man Amnesty International. And a campaigner, incidentally, who knows what it is to be spied on, followed, and publicly denounced in his struggle to win freedom of speech for the hereditary monarchy.This is the unafraid, outspoken dissident who refused to dine with President Jiang Zemin, out of solidarity for the Dalai Lama, and determined that this deliberate snub should be advertised in the press, where the Chinese delegation would read it - and either fume with frustrated social ambition, or renounce their claim to Tibet.And this is the outspoken dissident who is also a close ally and companion of the rulers of Saudi Arabia, where, as he is presumably aware, many of the liberties he craves for the oppressed Chinese are routinely denied to subjects of the Saud dynasty. Possibly, he prefers the Arab rulers' noble, hawk-carrying look to that of the yellow-tinged Chinese ""waxworks"" in their ill-fitting suits. Or it could be a question of artistic affinity. In 2001 Charles and Prince Khalid al-Faisal held a joint exhibition of their paintings; watercolour prince reaching out to oil-painting prince, across the human rights divide. Unless it is the very different feel of human rights violations, when they are imposed by a hereditary monarch who has been educated at an English public school. If so, this would explain Charles's trip to Bhutan, a few years ago, where the torture and ethnic cleansing of Nepalese speakers did not prevent him enjoying hours in the company of the absolute monarch, King Wangchuck.What manner of dissident, then, does Prince Charles aspire to be? He travels too much to have a lot in common with Aung San Suu Kyi, and while his zeal for writing letters betrays some affinity with the late Mary Whitehouse, the astonishing range of his known interventions (one senses the existence of many more, of which we remain unaware) - medicine, China, history teaching, architecture, GM foods, Shakespeare, the compensation culture, religion, farming, hunting, cancer care, nano-technology, mutton, political correctness gone mad - makes him more reminiscent, surely, of Gandhi, whose unorthodoxies also extended beyond revolutionary political thinking to embrace spirituality, morality, dietary restrictions, and dress.True, Gandhi is indelibly associated with non-violence and sexual restraint, while the Prince has been known to throw books and wrench washbasins off walls, but in their shared sense of destiny, their search for the truth, ambitions for their country, and strict rules about what to eat for breakfast, the two might be spiritual brothers, each filled with a profound sense of mission to do what is right. ""You have to stand against the whole world although you may have to stand alone,"" Gandhi said. ""You have to stare in the face the whole world although the world may look at you with blood-shot eyes. Do not fear. Trust the little voice residing within your heart."" Or, as it might be, sitting on your throne.It could be, of course, that when he inherits, the Prince plans at once to abandon controversy, emulating instead his stoical mother, who this week received at the palace - with her habitual lack of complaint - a reception for expatriate Australians including Clive James, Germaine Greer, and her old tormentor, Rolf Harris. But given the prince's existing commitment to saying the unsayable on any subject from grey goo to the power of coffee enemas, the acquisition of a throne seems more likely to inspire still greater flights of unfettered self-expression. At liberty to snub or flatter any political leader he chooses, King Charles III will be free to invite the entire Saudi royal family to hunt in St James's Park, to commission Quinlan Terry to beautify both the interior and facade of Buckingham Palace with ornamental pineapples, and - once a week! - to introduce prime ministers as yet unborn to the mysteries of integrated medicine, before reading to them, for hours at a time, from Shakespeare's Henry V or the King James Bible. There will no mummy to glare at him, no daddy to mock him, and more importantly, no interfering little Bollands where there should be only pleasing and agreeable favourites. No one will dare implore him to avoid controversy and ludicrous contradictions (such as helicopter travel and lectures on global warming). Mankind, in short, will be ready to receive his message. He will be our first absolute dissident.","William Hague had a dose of it yesterday, just as Tony Blair had before him. Neither of them would have been surprised: after all, it has become the quasi-divine right of party leaders to be swamped in the ovations and adulations of their party conference. But one man will have no such luck. David Trimble will not be forced to adopt a pose of shy modesty, halting the rolling applause of delegates when he faces the Ulster Unionist conference tomorrow. On the contrary, he will face an audience at least half of which is plotting his downfall - scheduled for a special meeting of the party's ruling council at the end of the month. The plotters are the likes of William Thompson, one of Trimble's MPs who yesterday offered this comradely assessment of his leader's position: ""He is on the skids and cannot survive.""  Thompson and friends want Trimble to pull out of Northern Ireland's fledgling administration, thereby collapsing the institution. As the secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, warned yesterday, that's a fast track to putting 1998's Good Friday agreement in the deep freeze if not the morgue. The plotters' motives are a mix of conviction - they reckon the agreement has brought unionists too little and republicans too much - and self-interest: after the hardliners of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists snatched the UUP stronghold of South Antrim in a byelection last month, they fear for their own political skins.  So Trimble has no shortage of reasons for walking away from the peace process: he wants to keep his job. Nor would he lack arguments. He could say the South Antrim result shows his community has lost faith in the accord. He could point to the early release of terrorist prisoners and the proposed name change of the Royal Ulster Constabulary as proof of how much unionists have been asked to give - and the lack of progress on decommissioning as proof of how little they have won in return. He could cite the loyalist civil war and yesterday's bomb alert on the Belfast-Dublin railway line, almost certainly the work of dissident republicans, as evidence that the peace process has brought plenty of process - but all too little peace.   For all that, he should not walk away from the peace table. First, he should remember that, when the unionist people had a chance to vote on the Good Friday agreement, they voted yes. That moral mandate remains - and with it a moral obligation not to destroy the accord. Only a no vote in a new referendum can remove that duty.  Second, he has a powerful response to those who say the agreement has brought unionists nothing. Trimble   can boast - indeed should have spent two years boasting - that, thanks to the deal he negotiated, unionists have won enormous gains. For the first time, republicanism has accepted the partition of Ireland, confirmed by Sinn Fein's presence in the Belfast executive and assembly. What's more the Irish Republic has given up its historic claim to the north, rewording its constitution accordingly. No unionist leader ever won such a prize before.  But if these advances seem abstract, Trimble should ask unionists to look around. Yes, there is still violence - from the fratricidal feuding on the Shankill Road to the enduring menace of the Real IRA - but the once all-pervasive threat from the provisionals has been quieted. The IRA has made as clear as it can its resignation from warfare, opening up its once top-secret arsenals to outside inspection - unimaginable a decade ago. More concrete still, unionists can see the change the peace process has made - with foreign investment flowing in and business at last allowed to flourish.  If none of that prevails,   Trimble should ask the nay-sayers what they would do in his place. Do they really think that ending self-rule in Northern Ireland would make decommissioning more likely - that if unionists say no, then republicans will say yes? What logic is it that makes the rejectionists believe they can refuse every compromise - keep the RUC as it is and share no power with nationalists -yet still expect the other side to keep giving? Mandelson is right: unless both sides give and take, there can be no accord.  That means nationalist flexibility on policing and republican movement on decommissioning, but it also requires a reciprocal approach from unionism. For peace processes have their own dynamic: if one side refuses to budge then the other does, too. The result is not always a return to the status quo ante, but something worse - a lurch back into all-out confrontation. If they doubt it, unionists need only look at that other stalled peace process -now spilling blood in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.  Those seeking the removal of David Trimble, unionism's most accomplished peacemaker, should think on that. The absence of peace is not a vacuum - it is war."
1,"In its latest bulletin from the frontiers of mental health research, the Daily Mail reports that Prince Charles seems to be, tragically, losing his tenuous hold on sanity, smashing china and losing his temper. ""So just what is wrong with the Prince of Wales,"" probed Richard Kay. Well, it's pretty obvious isn't it? He's gone mad. Or worse. ""Friends ... are increasingly concerned about his wellbeing."" Which sounds as if the prince has joined Les Dennis, Winona Ryder, Michael Barrymore and Jeffrey Archer, all of whom have been reported, at various times, to be on ""suicide watch"". If only it were so easy! In jail, where the term originated, suicidal inmates can be checked every hour or more, through a handy peephole. But distressed celebrities are scattered all over the place, often behind closed doors, and quite impossible for their carers in the press to keep tabs on. The safest solution, surely, would be for Lord Rothermere or one of his competitors to establish a sort of celebrity Bedlam adjacent to their newsrooms into which these tragic individuals could be committed for their own good. With the stars monitored 24 hours a day by staff reporters and media mental health experts such as Raj Persaud, we could rest assured that everything was being done to stand between our favourite celebrities and their besetting problems with depression and alcoholism, shop-lifting and overweight and - perhaps saddest of all - crockery.","In further sensational, never previously broadcast interviews, Princess Diana describes events which will astonish the public and cast yet further doubts on her husband's fitness to rule. The recordings were made by her voice coach, Peter Pension-Scheme, whose teaching methods included immortalising the Princess on compromising video tapes, which were left with him for safe-keeping. In one tape, he is heard encouraging her to discuss her troubled marriage: ""You must have been desperate for a real, red-blooded man, given that your everyday life was a desperate vortex of disappointment, bulimia and unbearable sexual frustration."" ""Yeah,"" Diana says. Pension-Scheme: ""Your husband wasn't really meeting your needs?""  The Princess laughs. ""Twice a year, birthdays and Christmas - and that was cancelled if either of them fell on the 13th of the month. Typical Libra."" Pension-Scheme asks: ""So you were forced to seek intimacy elsewhere?"" ""And how,"" Diana says, rolling her eyes. ""Couldn't get enough - until we were found out. Then it was curtains."" Although she does not mention any names, it is understood that she is referring to John Major, the former Tory prime minister.  Pension-Scheme: ""He's said to be a very well endowed man."" Diana giggles again. ""Shall we say I thought he was just drop dead gorgeous. I don't find it easy to discuss - but I used to fantasise about running away from all this, finding a little bungalow somewhere, and spending the rest of my life taking care of him - but it wasn't meant to be.""   Diana's intimate friendship with Mr Major is understood to have continued until he was thrown out of office in 1997. Asked if she thinks his electoral defeat had anything to do with MI5, Diana lowers her voice. ""With a little help from You Know Who. I didn't know anything about it until Labour had been in for three weeks. Charles just came in and told me they'd won. By a landslide. Typical."" Minutes later she had to put on her public face and go shopping. ""I was devastated. Threw both of us down the stairs. Total and utter stitch up. But there was no way of proving it.""  The outgoing Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, has ordered an investigation into claims of voting irregularities in the 1997 election.  Before she was due to make an important speech, Mr Pension-Scheme would urge Diana to focus on the most hurtful aspects of life with her husband, then imagine herself performing a seductive victory dance with Wayne Sleep. She says she was devastated to discover, during her engagement, that Charles snored. ""Too late to change my mind. Completely shattering. He said he wasn't going to be the first Prince of Wales not to snore. Utterly typical.""  Pension-Scheme: ""Anything really disgusting? On a totally confidential basis, obviously."" Diana pauses. ""The worst thing - never told a soul, just too dangerous - is the devil worshipping thing. Right from the start of our marriage, I'd hear these terrifying howls at Highgrove. Spine chilling. Charles used to say it was owls."" Refusing to accept this explanation, a frightened Diana contacted one of her clairvoyants, Evelina Chequebook. ""Evelina came down and said the place was emitting more high-potency evil than anywhere she'd ever experienced. Totally toxic. Did my head in. Told me I absolutely had to get the boys out of there, before they were sucked into it. Can you believe it?""  Mr Pension-Scheme asks what happened. ""Went to see the Top Lady, as I call her,"" Diana says. ""Said, I happen know for a fact that Charles and Camilla and the Van Cutsems are devil-worshipping in the quinsy garden."" But the Queen refused to intervene.""Just said, 'Oh   Charles is utterly insane. Always has been. Always will be.' I said, 'Insanity! I see mental instability of such magnitude in my role that you would never understand.' And that was it. Nada.""  The outgoing Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, has ordered an investigation into claims that a satanic cult is operating from Highgrove.  In another sensational confession, Diana says she discovered the location of Lord Lucan. Invited by Peter Pension-Scheme to share any empowering but deeply private experiences which might extend her vocal range, the Princess reveals that she has the power to track down missing people and objects. ""People who have passed on, they tell me stuff. Tracked Charles down once, with his Lady. Behind his faith shed. Boy, were they surprised. And an earring. And Elvis came through once, saying Lucan's not really dead at all. Got me so upset.""  ""Where is he now?"" Pension-Scheme interjects. ""What's the exact address?""  ""He's living under a false identity in -"" here the Princess checks herself. ""I can't tell you. Too risky. And he begged me not to expose him. Knows what he did was wrong, but he's trying to rebuild his life. Absolutely begged. I said OK. Left it to fate. I know what goes around comes around."" Asked if she has told anyone else about her psychic powers, Diana tells Mr Pension-Scheme that he's the first. ""I know I can trust you.""  On the basis of new evidence, Sir John Stevens has ordered a re-investigation of Lord Lucan's disappearance. <B>Who is the 'melons' man? </B> <BR>  Even as one sympathises with the women MPs who, as a new report alleges, have endured unforgiveable insults from male colleagues, their reluctance to disclose which individuals offered them £10,000 for sex (reported by Oona King), or shouted ""melons"" (Barbara Follett), or ""literally"" pinned them to a wall by the neck (unnamed woman MP), or expressed a desire to ""roger"" a nearby woman (reported by Jackie Ballard), is quite mystifying. Who are these men? If they are still in parliament, should they not be named, and if guilty, subjected to public emasculation without anaesthetic? Or at any rate, invited to step down. Not only is it wrong to protect these primitives, the steady drone of unresolved complaint, if it persists for much longer, might give people the unfortunate impression that many women MPs are disproportionately preoccupied with their own specialness and personal grievances. One is still grumbling about the ""public school atmosphere"". Yet another says she ""dreads"" PM's questions. Can nothing be done to help them? Some effective collective action might liberate female MPs and civilise rogue males, at the same time as encouraging women who regularly face worse treatment, in far harder circumstances, all over the country.  Unless one explanation for this apparent passivity is that many of the more lurid offences reported this week actually occurred years ago, long before the breast-feeding reforms and the changes in Commons hours and culture which now make the woman MP's lot the envy of many full-time workers with four weeks annual holiday. Although, as Dawn Primarolo suggested, it can still be difficult for women MPs to escape from work in order to watch their children play in rugby or football matches. I wonder if they have considered doing so during important parliamentary debates.   A debate, for example, like the one about David Blunkett's outrageous and ignorant proposal to restrict freedom of speech where it relates to religion. You couldn't help but notice, on Tuesday afternoon, that this long, non-boorish discussion did not feature a single contribution from a woman backbencher. Two female junior ministers spoke in defence of censorship. Perhaps there were some important matches on.    <B>Ridicule us too, please </B><BR>  Jackie Rowley, communications director for Charles Kennedy, emails to ask why the Lib Dem    leader's card did not feature in a piece, published earlier this week, about politicians' Christmas cards. ""Did you fail to mention the Kennedy card because it was too normal (and in aid of a constituency charity)?"" she asks. I see that lack of space is no excuse for ignoring Mr Kennedy's almost unimproveable Christmas card (in aid of the Highland Hospice in Inverness), which depicts a croft in the foreground and, behind it, the sunlit eminence of Glencoe, partially obscured by a line of horizontal cloud. I am conscious that there may be other cards which ought to be described in the Guardian. If so, do let me know."

Funerals are difficult. Too basic, and they seem depressing. Too fussy, and they risk vulgarity. One remembers the apocryphal send-off for Woody Allen's grandfather, featuring a buffet table laden with 'a replica of the deceased in potato salad'. Last week, Chatsworth offered its idealised tableau of a British demise. A hearse bearing Andrew Cavendish, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, wound through parkland lined by ribbons of servants in black serge and starched white aprons. The spectacle summarised how the rich die, and how they live. Never, outside a Conrad Black dinner party, have so many below-stairs staff been gathered together. The scene could have been a flashback to the margarine-advert England of Stanley Baldwin, except that Chatsworth's 600 employees are closer to the cast of a club reps docusoap than to old retainers. Most work for the tourist trade, running playgrounds or supplying internet customers with 'Duke's hampers' (price £499, plus £7.95 delivery).  In 1799, the Duke's forebear was the fourth wealthiest man in Britain. Since then, the aristocracy, lacking the wit to invent unopenable milk cartons or flatpack tables, has slithered down the international rich lists. The modern toff has had to compress Adam Smith's three categories of landowner, businessman and labourer into one multi-purpose model. That is why the current Earl of Sandwich is stuffing tuna wraps and why the departing Duke of Devonshire was winged to his rest by short-order chefs from Jean-Pierre's Chatsworth bar.  These days, only tycoons and footballers exist like Bourbon kings. A £700 million lawsuit issued by Hollinger against Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, alleges that the Blacks' excesses included billing the firm for 'household staff, including chefs, senior butlers, butlers, under-butlers, chauffeurs and footmen.' The Blacks' invention of an Almanack de Gotha of the buttling classes intrigued the media less, however, than Lady Amiel-Black's tip to a Bergdorf Goodman store doorman.  It can't have been her creativity that rankled, since many journalists are more inventive with expenses claims. The fascination of the Blacks is, instead, their cocktail of grandeur and frugality, the rich people's traits that others most love to deride. The Duke of Devonshire, a humble man, gave to good causes in the noblesse oblige tradition of the 19th-century landowner, while Hollinger, so its lawsuit claims, paid or promised $250,000 to charities on behalf of Amiel-Black.  The rich are often stingy. Queen Mary was a kleptomaniac who helped herself to knick-knacks from other people's houses, while Ingvar Kamprad, the Ikea founder and the wealthiest man in the world, drives an ancient Volvo. Tycoons have tended, too, towards madness, partly because they can pay others to sustain their worst delusions. Hence the Mormon army employed by the dying Howard Hughes to swat any germ-bearing fly entering the airspaces near the sealed room where he lay watching Ice Station Zebra on a video loop.  Though often selfish and sometimes unhinged, the rich have seldom seemed so dislikeable as now. Maybe plutocrats have to try harder to impress. When anyone with a semi in the right bit of inner London is a millionaire, only dollar billionaires feel truly wealthy. And when the middle classes, too upper crust to dust, hire two million servants of their own, the oligarchy needs better status symbols. In the US, the co-founder of Microsoft has just arrived at a New Orleans conference in the world's largest private yacht. Paul Allen's acquisition has a deck the size of Old Trafford, a submarine in the hold and a fuel tank that takes $250,000 to fill. Think Barbara Amiel's charity budget in unleaded diesel.   Lower down the food chain of plutocracy, fat cats are thriving. Luc Vandevelde, of M&amp;S, received a £450,000 annual package for failing to beguile women with polyester suits and this spring's toeless tights. Vandevelde, though sacked, has so many other lucrative boardroom roles that he will barely make it through M&amp;S's five-items-only checkout.  Ken Clarke told me, when he was Chancellor, that he wished business leaders 'would show a decent level of restraint'. His departure from the Tory script was aimed at proto-fat cats such as Cedric Brown, who was paid like one of Lord Black's Shake'n'Vac army in comparison with today's CEOs. Ten years down the line, optimists dare to think that, if Gordon Brown gets to be Prime Minister, he will tax the rich an extra 1 per cent. That wish may be forlorn. So far, the Chancellor's tax and benefit policy has helped the worst-off and lifted 700,000 children out of poverty. But 3.6m others remain poor, and the income gap is being prised apart by a failure to redistribute wealth.  Reluctance to make the rich pay their share is partly down to the awe in which government holds new money. From the Beckhams to a record influx of foreign billionaires, high-rollers are lionised. The moderately wealthy don't complain, partly because a rentier lifestyle, once for the coked-up sons of earls, is now an aspiration for those with a Fulham postcode and a trust fund for the children. Poorer people are not, by instinct, jealous. And even if they were, militancy was neutered long ago by Thatcher.  Helping the rich is part of the national culture, just as buying the Big Issue, or giving money to beggars, is not. Those on average incomes tend to be embarrassed by the impoverished, while   cheerfully subsidising affluent dependents, such as the royal family. It would be wrong to think that Prince Charles is scaling down the monarchy's extravagance in his current visit to Mount Athos, a remote religious community he uses as a spiritual Champneys. The austere regime is leavened by the prince's habit of arriving, often on a yacht owned by the Latsis dynasty, with 30 suitcases, one police bodyguard, one folding bed, one satellite telephone and several coolboxes of Palace delicacies to replace the monks' inedible bean stew.  Supporting the royals has always been justified, however shakily, by the argument that they work for the public good. New plutocrats do not. With exceptions, such as the Sainsburys, they shirk the philanthropy of their American counterparts, from Rockefeller and Carnegie onwards. Unlike Edwardian aristocrats, they rarely feel compelled, by God, guilt or public duty, to plough an unnecessary penny back into the public domain.  Orwell's moneyed and ruling classes have impacted into one. Nancy Mitford's U and non-U categories are only for snobs with chilblains and defective heating systems. This is a society that disdains rank and prejudice, and which has just been promised a brand new equality commission to uphold high standards. And still, old hierarchies linger.  A hearse goes by, and few scoff at the battalions of retainers that watch it pass, or mock the self-reverence of the rich. Instead, there is a reflex twitch of nostalgia for feudal England. Maybe everyone is suffering from Trollope overload. Or perhaps the revamped squirarchy, custodian of art and purveyor of damson jam online, looks suddenly less alarming than new potentates."

Meanwhile, his own enemies, who include a former (male) Australian lover and the divorced gay comedian, Michael Barrymore, insist that the butler - who is married, with two children - is himself untrustworthy, having airbrushed a strenuous-sounding gay past from his CV.   <B> Is homosexuality compulsory for royal servants? </B><BR> On the contrary. In the Kensington closets the princess's cast-off clothes competed for space with happily married fathers of two.   <B> What has the royal yacht Britannia got to do with it? </B><BR> According to some uncharitable reports, Burrell was aboard during an incident involving a number of crew members, royal staff and a quantity of gay pornography. It was after this that the queen reportedly advised him that he might find himself a wife.   <B> And how is that remotely relevant to the truth or otherwise of Burrel's disclosures? </B> <BR>Beats me.   <B> Worse things happen at sea, don't they? </B> <BR>And on land too. This weekend George Smith, a former colleague of the butler (divorced, two children) joined in the general unburdening, confiding to the Mail on Sunday that he was the victim of a homosexual rape, allegedly enacted by a trusted royal servant (married, two children) of Prince Charles (divorced, two children). Snaking out of these accusations and counter accusations is another rumour of a sexual encounter said to be so compromising that it could jeopardise the future of the royal family. Then again, they were saying that 10 years ago, after the Camilla tape, but even the Italians no longer call Charles Tamponcino.   <B> How did it start? </B> <BR>With a police raid in January 2001. Officers led by the top vertigo-sufferer, Maxine de Brunner, knocked up Burrell at dawn, reportedly demanding to know the whereabouts of ""the crown jewels"".   <B> Was there any evidence Burrell had profited from theft? </B> <BR>The police, unaware of his work as a media etiquette expert, believed his earnings were dishonestly acquired.    <B> How could they be so stupid? </B><BR> Or determined. We must surmise, like the queen, that there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge.   <B> When were the crown jewels moved to Runcorn? </B><BR> Don't be obtuse. It can't have escaped even Guardian readers that the ""crown jewels"" we are talking about here are the contents of an initialled box in which Diana had hidden a variety of potentially incriminating treasures, including letters from Prince Philip calling her a ""trollop"", ex-lover James Hewitt's signet ring and a tape she had recorded (apparently, after plying him with drink), of one servant recalling his alleged rape by another. This box, which seems to have been almost as magically accommodating as Pandora's, may also have contained video diaries of the princess making more unflattering accusations about her in-laws.  <B> Who filmed her? </B><BR> Possibly Martin Bashir, who served the Princesss for a while in a junior-rock-like capacity. This apparently ended after he vouchsafed, somewhat incautiously, to Burrell, that he would ""like to give her one"".  <B> Regina v Burrell: </B><BR> When Burrell appeared at the high court, charged with the theft of 342 comically disparate objects, the judge, Mrs Justice Rafferty, did her utmost to safeguard the reputation of Regina and Co by censoring documents in court, but the case immediately offered treasurable, if pitiable glimpses of the sort of relationship Princess Diana had enjoyed with her family. Her brother, hero of the funeral, who has made the dead Diana into a successful tourist attraction, had previously refused her use of a house on his land, fearing invasion of his privacy. There might have been more, but the case against Burrell collapsed just before he was due to give evidence, Regina having suddenly recalled a conversation with Burrell, in which he had told her he would remove papers for safe-keeping.  <B> Why didn't she intervene earlier? </B><BR> Odd, isn't it? Perhaps there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge.  <B> And the Spencers? </B><BR> One possible explanation for both the royals and the Spencers's carelessness in allowing that gossip-seeking missile, Burrell the chance to detonate in court, was that all the parties involved were engaged, in what, thanks to the concluding scene of Quentin Tarantino's film, Reservoir Dogs, we recognise as a Mexican Standoff. Both the royals and the Spencers, presumably aware of his gay past, may have hoped that Burrell's own sense of self-preservation would deter him from revealing unpalatable truths about them. But it didn't, and all have now had their reputations battered.   <B> Why? </B><BR> Partly because Burrell, who may not, after all, be terribly bright, failed to grasp that discretion (though less cathartic than a £300,000 deal with the Mirror) would be both safer and more lucrative than confession. Partly because it was too late. As well as the revelations about the Spencers offered in open court, a signed legal statement by Burrell written to prove his rock-like status with the princess, had already been leaked to the press, disclosing that his extensive duties included smuggling her lovers, such as Dr Hasnat Khan, in and out of the palace, as well as buying pornography for her son and conveying her donations to prostitutes at Paddington Station.  <B> What very discreet prostitutes. </B> <BR>Absolutely. At a time when even royal servants seem to have forgotten their sacred duty of silence, how reassuring to find that in some professions at least, there is still some regard for decency and discretion. They are an example to us all.  <B> Who was Dr Armani? </B><BR> This mystery American, who used often to interrupt Hasnat Khan as he laboured over an open heart, turns out to be have been the Princess of Wales, using one of her amusing aliases. It was another trick of the fun-loving princess's to tease the public by buying pregnancy tests in Boots. Burrell further disclosed that ""Dr Armani"" once went out to see Khan wearing only her jewellery and a fur coat. He did not disclose whether it was the same evening that Diana threw an unwanted fur coat out of her car-window, aiming it at another of those immensely discreet beggar-women who inhabit the streets of London, but we must hope not. As Bagehot says, it is not good to let daylight in on magic. Especially on a chilly evening. At home, the adaptable Burrell would also prepare easily regurgitated food such as custard and rice pudding for his mistress. Khan appears to have preferred Kentucky Fried Chicken, so much so that Burrell would often find him hiding - vainly, for Diana was nothing if not persistent - in the Colonel's Fulham outlet.   <B> Is that what rocks do? </B><BR> There seems to be no precise job description. In court, Frances Shand Kydd claimed that her daughter had a quite a collection of rocks - so many, you gathered, that if she had only scattered a few hardy alpines between them and placed them on a south-facing terrace, they might have taken a prize at the Chelsea Flower Show. Since then, a positive avalanche of self-styled rocks has suggested that if Burrell was principal boulder, he was surrounded by some very prominent pebbles.  <B> Still, hardly a constitutional crisis. </B><BR> If you believe Tony Blair. But Burrell also confirmed that there was, indeed, a ""rape tape"" in existence, ditto a victim, and possibly evidence of a palace cover-up. Not to mention a perpetrator.  <B> Charges presumably nullified by the butler's own economy with the truth? </B><BR> Not necessarily. His principal challenger is Michael Barrymore, who claimed, ""Paul Burrell seduced me as Diana lay dead.""  <B> Every seduction since September 1 1997 has taken place with Diana lying dead. </B><BR> True, and it should be remembered that Barrymore, whose own reputation has yet to recover from the mysterious death of a young man in his swimming pool, is not generally renowned for the peerless quality of his testimony. His ex-wife, recording her suffering in a new book, recalled ""He was out of his head on drugs at Di's funeral.""  <B> What part did Daniella Westbrook play in all this? </B><BR> Due to some tabloid oversight, there are still a few celebrity names missing from What the Butler Saw, but this is sure to have been corrected by the end of the week.  <B> Why are some newspapers suddenly so interested an obscure royal servant called Michael Fawcett? </B><BR> Apparently because of concerns over his role in selling unwanted gifts received by the Prince of Wales. ""Fawcett the Fence"", as he is reportedly refered to by some colleagues, appears in a much used photograph of the Prince of Wales taken while shooting at Sandringham.  <B> Do people really still wear trousers like that? </B><BR> Apparently.  <B> This doesn't quite explain the intensity of their interest in him does it? </B><BR> Possibly not.  <B> Does any of this actually matter? </B><BR> There are three schools of thought.  <B> 1 The long view. </B><BR> Endorsed by none other than royal biographer, Ben Pimlott, who has dismissed the whole thing as ""boring, frankly"", this school thinks we should all grow up. The Butler-fest only tells us something we already knew: we are abjectly in thrall to celebrity gossip. As for constitutional significance: how, the long-viewers say, can this little of bit palace unpleasantness possibly compare with the sexual and fiscal vagaries of Charles II, the trials of Queen Caroline, the deeply felt hostility towards that goody goody, Queen Victoria? Besides, if you want a royal family, why complain that they're not like decent ordinary folk? Plotting, bossing and showing-off is what they are for.  <B> 2 The short view. </B><BR> Endorsed by almost everyone else, this school holds it to be self-evident that the whole Burrell affair, having multiplied our knowledge of the private life of the royal family by about 1,000 times in two weeks, is necessarily fascinating. And where are the tapes?  <B> 3 The exalted view. </B><BR> Goes ""I'm not interested in the individuals, so much as the institution. If only we could put all this infantilising, prurient rubbish behind us, and engage in a really exciting debate about what a detailed constitution for a republic might look like ...Did she really go out in fur coat with nothing under it?""  <B> When was that glorious jubilee? </B><BR> June 5 was the day of the flypast. Remember? Many republicans and doubters, among them Ros Wynne Jones of the Mirror, accepted that, whatever you might say about them, the royal family truly is for ever. ""My republican dream was shattered"", wrote Ros. Watching the flypast, she thought, the queen must have realised ""that the celebrations were not just for the last 50 years but for the next 50, during which her family were now guaranteed to remain at the heart of public life"". Only a few months later, it looks as if Ros's arithmetic might have been a bit out. ""It is not Paul Burrell whose reputation is seriously under attack"", the Mirror wrote yesterday, ""but that of the Royal Family and their advisors"". Maybe it was the sight of the planes, rather than the royals, that misted up our eyes.  <B> So how about another flypast? </B><BR> Assuming that the queen, Charles, and Philip were actually on board the planes, it might just work. But best wait, perhaps, until Princess Anne has appeared in court to answer for Eglantyne Jebb, her devil dog, to save her having to catch up later.   <B> Are there any winners? </B><BR> Kentucky Fried Chicken? After all, if top heart surgeons eat it, it can't be all that bad.   <B> And the biggest losers? </B><BR> Last week, by common consent, it was the man whose sense of duty drove him to hold Prince Charles's specimen bottle. Only now is it dawning that according to the arcane, below-stairs rituals of the royal household, such a task might be considered a privilege. So it's the bottle I feel for. And those poor little princes.","In Blandings Castle and Elsewhere, PG Wodehouse recorded the sterling response of Beach, the butler, on discovering Lord Emsworth's son in a drawing room with a sack of rats in his hand. ""With a murmured apology, he secured the sack and started to withdraw. It was not strictly his duty to carry rats, but a good butler is always ready to give and take. Only so can the amenities of a large country house be preserved."" Anyone who has marvelled, in recent days, at the duties routinely performed by Paul Burrell in his days of butling for the Prince and Princess of Wales may find that the Wodehouse passage has lost some of its old impact. They may feel that in comparison with the demands on Burrell's give and take, Beach's was barely tested. For a man, like Burrell, who might, at any time, be ordered to retrieve one of Diana's unwilling lovers from his hiding place in a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet, or have a book thrown at him by Prince Charles as a punishment for second-rate lying, or be despatched to Paddington to stand proxy for the Princess as the saviour of deserving prostitutes, or be sent out by his mistress to buy pornography for her teenage son, the efficient disposal of a sack of rats would probably have presented a nice break from routine. For Burrell's unfortunate colleague, the valet who had to hold Prince Charles's hospital specimen pot while the royal membrum virile pissed into it, rat-securing could only have offered a glimpse of a better, more beautiful life. Of the many unanswered questions currently stacking-up, Sherlock Holmes-fashion, in the wake of the Burrell trial, the most fascinating is not, surely, the issue of why the Queen dallied so long before springing Burrell from the witness box, nor why our senior police investigators are so spectacularly thick, nor what possessed Burrell to remove boxes of old pop CDs, as well as letters, from proximity to those beastly shredding Spencers, but the far more intriguing subject of the Windsors' execrable treatment of their servants. How have they got away with it for so long?  Naturally, confidentiality agreements and the official secrets act have been helpful to the feudal tradition. Had it not been for Burrell's trial, Prince Charles must have felt quite confident that no one would find out that fibbing to his wife formed part of the Highgrove butler's job description. Wendy Berry, who wrote an engrossing account of her servitude at Highgrove (and one which was rather kinder, though otherwise consistent with the subsequently published recollections of Ken Wharfe, the detective, and Patrick Jephson, Diana's secretary) had to flee to America after Prince Charles took out an injunction on her book, one which remains in place, ensuring that no part of it can be quoted. But even with this legal deterrent to gossip, it is remarkable how little, until now, has been disclosed by their servants about the preposterous expectations and demands of members of the royal family.  Most people will have waited until the Burrell trial to discover that Prince Charles is notorious not only for temper tantrums but for the ludicrous and time-wasting requirement, like a child who cannot leave the house without her comfort blanket, that his personal arrangements, even in hospital, should replicate those at Highgrove. Thanks to Burrell, we now know that for the heir to the throne, there can be no disruption without a van-load of transitional objects. Also that this ardent believer in the dignity of mankind prefers, when at home, to recreate the social arrangements of Altman's satire, Gosford Park - a film, incidentally, which Charles has screened for guests at Sandringham: quality in the comfy chairs, servants in the hard ones at the back. Perhaps they were lucky. The Queen, by Burrell's account, prefers the lower orders to stand in her presence, even when, as in his own, notorious case, their encounter lasts for three hours.  As for these bullied butlers and dressers, valets and housemaids, only proximity to power - and, of course, the free accommodation - can explain why so many are content to indulge their masters, remaining mutely loyal, infinitely discreet. For Burrell, Diana's intimacy and trust must have compensated for the dignity he forfeited when she appointed him Rock of the Bedchamber, a sort of gentleman-procurer responsible for delivering her lovers, stowed in a car boot, in and out of Kensington Palace. Similarly, his sovereign's abrupt recollection of their chat - ""the Queen came through for me"" - seems instantly to have made up for her two years of forgetfulness. Those who now condemn Burrell for telling his story should perhaps marvel instead at his forbearance during the many years of being pelted with books by the heir apparent and besieged by out-of-hours calls from the moody princess while unwanted presents from colonial visitors stoked the Highgrove bonfires. Moreover, even as they add to the gaiety of nations, the Burrell confessions may effect some improvement in palace working conditions. Next time some troublesome Helot has him reaching for the nearest, book-shaped missile, the Prince of Wales may want to think twice, and send for a rat sack instead."
0,"B> Why have we read so little about David Blunkett in recent days? </B><BR> Rightly or wrongly, many newspapers have taken the view that Blunkett and his latest crime-busting initiative are of less immediate interest to their readers than the scandal which now threatens to engulf the royal family - for another week, at least.  <B> What scandal is that? </B> <BR>To summarise, one which depicts many members of the royal family, both nuclear and extended, as callous, feuding, screwed-up and, more interestingly, as potential perverters of the course of justice.

And those poor little princes.","William Hague had a dose of it yesterday, just as Tony Blair had before him. Neither of them would have been surprised: after all, it has become the quasi-divine right of party leaders to be swamped in the ovations and adulations of their party conference. But one man will have no such luck. David Trimble will not be forced to adopt a pose of shy modesty, halting the rolling applause of delegates when he faces the Ulster Unionist conference tomorrow. On the contrary, he will face an audience at least half of which is plotting his downfall - scheduled for a special meeting of the party's ruling council at the end of the month. The plotters are the likes of William Thompson, one of Trimble's MPs who yesterday offered this comradely assessment of his leader's position: ""He is on the skids and cannot survive.""  Thompson and friends want Trimble to pull out of Northern Ireland's fledgling administration, thereby collapsing the institution. As the secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, warned yesterday, that's a fast track to putting 1998's Good Friday agreement in the deep freeze if not the morgue. The plotters' motives are a mix of conviction - they reckon the agreement has brought unionists too little and republicans too much - and self-interest: after the hardliners of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists snatched the UUP stronghold of South Antrim in a byelection last month, they fear for their own political skins.  So Trimble has no shortage of reasons for walking away from the peace process: he wants to keep his job. Nor would he lack arguments. He could say the South Antrim result shows his community has lost faith in the accord. He could point to the early release of terrorist prisoners and the proposed name change of the Royal Ulster Constabulary as proof of how much unionists have been asked to give - and the lack of progress on decommissioning as proof of how little they have won in return. He could cite the loyalist civil war and yesterday's bomb alert on the Belfast-Dublin railway line, almost certainly the work of dissident republicans, as evidence that the peace process has brought plenty of process - but all too little peace.   For all that, he should not walk away from the peace table. First, he should remember that, when the unionist people had a chance to vote on the Good Friday agreement, they voted yes. That moral mandate remains - and with it a moral obligation not to destroy the accord. Only a no vote in a new referendum can remove that duty.  Second, he has a powerful response to those who say the agreement has brought unionists nothing. Trimble   can boast - indeed should have spent two years boasting - that, thanks to the deal he negotiated, unionists have won enormous gains. For the first time, republicanism has accepted the partition of Ireland, confirmed by Sinn Fein's presence in the Belfast executive and assembly. What's more the Irish Republic has given up its historic claim to the north, rewording its constitution accordingly. No unionist leader ever won such a prize before.  But if these advances seem abstract, Trimble should ask unionists to look around. Yes, there is still violence - from the fratricidal feuding on the Shankill Road to the enduring menace of the Real IRA - but the once all-pervasive threat from the provisionals has been quieted. The IRA has made as clear as it can its resignation from warfare, opening up its once top-secret arsenals to outside inspection - unimaginable a decade ago. More concrete still, unionists can see the change the peace process has made - with foreign investment flowing in and business at last allowed to flourish.  If none of that prevails,   Trimble should ask the nay-sayers what they would do in his place. Do they really think that ending self-rule in Northern Ireland would make decommissioning more likely - that if unionists say no, then republicans will say yes? What logic is it that makes the rejectionists believe they can refuse every compromise - keep the RUC as it is and share no power with nationalists -yet still expect the other side to keep giving? Mandelson is right: unless both sides give and take, there can be no accord.  That means nationalist flexibility on policing and republican movement on decommissioning, but it also requires a reciprocal approach from unionism. For peace processes have their own dynamic: if one side refuses to budge then the other does, too. The result is not always a return to the status quo ante, but something worse - a lurch back into all-out confrontation. If they doubt it, unionists need only look at that other stalled peace process -now spilling blood in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.  Those seeking the removal of David Trimble, unionism's most accomplished peacemaker, should think on that. The absence of peace is not a vacuum - it is war."

Anyone who has marvelled, in recent days, at the duties routinely performed by Paul Burrell in his days of butling for the Prince and Princess of Wales may find that the Wodehouse passage has lost some of its old impact. They may feel that in comparison with the demands on Burrell's give and take, Beach's was barely tested. For a man, like Burrell, who might, at any time, be ordered to retrieve one of Diana's unwilling lovers from his hiding place in a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet, or have a book thrown at him by Prince Charles as a punishment for second-rate lying, or be despatched to Paddington to stand proxy for the Princess as the saviour of deserving prostitutes, or be sent out by his mistress to buy pornography for her teenage son, the efficient disposal of a sack of rats would probably have presented a nice break from routine. For Burrell's unfortunate colleague, the valet who had to hold Prince Charles's hospital specimen pot while the royal membrum virile pissed into it, rat-securing could only have offered a glimpse of a better, more beautiful life. Of the many unanswered questions currently stacking-up, Sherlock Holmes-fashion, in the wake of the Burrell trial, the most fascinating is not, surely, the issue of why the Queen dallied so long before springing Burrell from the witness box, nor why our senior police investigators are so spectacularly thick, nor what possessed Burrell to remove boxes of old pop CDs, as well as letters, from proximity to those beastly shredding Spencers, but the far more intriguing subject of the Windsors' execrable treatment of their servants. How have they got away with it for so long?  Naturally, confidentiality agreements and the official secrets act have been helpful to the feudal tradition. Had it not been for Burrell's trial, Prince Charles must have felt quite confident that no one would find out that fibbing to his wife formed part of the Highgrove butler's job description. Wendy Berry, who wrote an engrossing account of her servitude at Highgrove (and one which was rather kinder, though otherwise consistent with the subsequently published recollections of Ken Wharfe, the detective, and Patrick Jephson, Diana's secretary) had to flee to America after Prince Charles took out an injunction on her book, one which remains in place, ensuring that no part of it can be quoted. But even with this legal deterrent to gossip, it is remarkable how little, until now, has been disclosed by their servants about the preposterous expectations and demands of members of the royal family.  Most people will have waited until the Burrell trial to discover that Prince Charles is notorious not only for temper tantrums but for the ludicrous and time-wasting requirement, like a child who cannot leave the house without her comfort blanket, that his personal arrangements, even in hospital, should replicate those at Highgrove. Thanks to Burrell, we now know that for the heir to the throne, there can be no disruption without a van-load of transitional objects. Also that this ardent believer in the dignity of mankind prefers, when at home, to recreate the social arrangements of Altman's satire, Gosford Park - a film, incidentally, which Charles has screened for guests at Sandringham: quality in the comfy chairs, servants in the hard ones at the back. Perhaps they were lucky. The Queen, by Burrell's account, prefers the lower orders to stand in her presence, even when, as in his own, notorious case, their encounter lasts for three hours.  As for these bullied butlers and dressers, valets and housemaids, only proximity to power - and, of course, the free accommodation - can explain why so many are content to indulge their masters, remaining mutely loyal, infinitely discreet. For Burrell, Diana's intimacy and trust must have compensated for the dignity he forfeited when she appointed him Rock of the Bedchamber, a sort of gentleman-procurer responsible for delivering her lovers, stowed in a car boot, in and out of Kensington Palace. Similarly, his sovereign's abrupt recollection of their chat - ""the Queen came through for me"" - seems instantly to have made up for her two years of forgetfulness. Those who now condemn Burrell for telling his story should perhaps marvel instead at his forbearance during the many years of being pelted with books by the heir apparent and besieged by out-of-hours calls from the moody princess while unwanted presents from colonial visitors stoked the Highgrove bonfires. Moreover, even as they add to the gaiety of nations, the Burrell confessions may effect some improvement in palace working conditions. Next time some troublesome Helot has him reaching for the nearest, book-shaped missile, the Prince of Wales may want to think twice, and send for a rat sack instead.","For loyal followers of Prince Charles's career, Mark Bolland's statement only confirmed something that became evident years ago, even before Jonathan Dimbleby's biography and television documentary introduced us to the suffering, misunderstood outsider who is our future king. As long ago as 1982, in one of my favourite Prince Charles speeches (in which he lectured the BMA on the benefits of healing), our embryonic dissident anticipated disapproval with a short digression about the role of the intellectual outcast, reminding the doctors of the persecution of the 16th-century physician, Paracelsus: ""He is probably remembered more for his fight against orthodoxy than for his achievements in the medical field. As a result of his unorthodox approach to medicine in his time, he was equated with the damnable Dr Faustus.""Such, the doctors gathered, was Charles's estimation of his own, heretical role. ""Perhaps,"" he told them, ""we just have to accept it is God's will that the unorthodox individual is doomed to years of frustration, ridicule and failure in order to act out his role in the scheme of things, until his day arrives and man-kind is ready to receive his message ...""Later, he appears to have extended this analysis to include the obstacles to popularity faced (though now, mercifully overcome) by his mistress; certainly he could be heard telling her in the Camillagate tape, ""You suffer all these indignities and tortures and calumnies."" By this time, it seems, the prince had come to feel that his sufferings so far surpassed the occasional comparison with Dr Faustus as to approach the trauma of contemporary political dissidents.Bolland's evidence, together with the extracts from the Chinese Takeaway diary, also suggest that, since styling himself a medico-mystical sort of seer, doomed to suffer the mockery of the ignorant for possessing insights whose truth would only be revealed long after his death (when they'd all be sorry), Prince Charles has developed into a roving, proactive campaigner for human rights, more along the lines of a one-man Amnesty International. And a campaigner, incidentally, who knows what it is to be spied on, followed, and publicly denounced in his struggle to win freedom of speech for the hereditary monarchy.This is the unafraid, outspoken dissident who refused to dine with President Jiang Zemin, out of solidarity for the Dalai Lama, and determined that this deliberate snub should be advertised in the press, where the Chinese delegation would read it - and either fume with frustrated social ambition, or renounce their claim to Tibet.And this is the outspoken dissident who is also a close ally and companion of the rulers of Saudi Arabia, where, as he is presumably aware, many of the liberties he craves for the oppressed Chinese are routinely denied to subjects of the Saud dynasty. Possibly, he prefers the Arab rulers' noble, hawk-carrying look to that of the yellow-tinged Chinese ""waxworks"" in their ill-fitting suits. Or it could be a question of artistic affinity. In 2001 Charles and Prince Khalid al-Faisal held a joint exhibition of their paintings; watercolour prince reaching out to oil-painting prince, across the human rights divide. Unless it is the very different feel of human rights violations, when they are imposed by a hereditary monarch who has been educated at an English public school. If so, this would explain Charles's trip to Bhutan, a few years ago, where the torture and ethnic cleansing of Nepalese speakers did not prevent him enjoying hours in the company of the absolute monarch, King Wangchuck.What manner of dissident, then, does Prince Charles aspire to be? He travels too much to have a lot in common with Aung San Suu Kyi, and while his zeal for writing letters betrays some affinity with the late Mary Whitehouse, the astonishing range of his known interventions (one senses the existence of many more, of which we remain unaware) - medicine, China, history teaching, architecture, GM foods, Shakespeare, the compensation culture, religion, farming, hunting, cancer care, nano-technology, mutton, political correctness gone mad - makes him more reminiscent, surely, of Gandhi, whose unorthodoxies also extended beyond revolutionary political thinking to embrace spirituality, morality, dietary restrictions, and dress.True, Gandhi is indelibly associated with non-violence and sexual restraint, while the Prince has been known to throw books and wrench washbasins off walls, but in their shared sense of destiny, their search for the truth, ambitions for their country, and strict rules about what to eat for breakfast, the two might be spiritual brothers, each filled with a profound sense of mission to do what is right. ""You have to stand against the whole world although you may have to stand alone,"" Gandhi said. ""You have to stare in the face the whole world although the world may look at you with blood-shot eyes. Do not fear. Trust the little voice residing within your heart."" Or, as it might be, sitting on your throne.It could be, of course, that when he inherits, the Prince plans at once to abandon controversy, emulating instead his stoical mother, who this week received at the palace - with her habitual lack of complaint - a reception for expatriate Australians including Clive James, Germaine Greer, and her old tormentor, Rolf Harris. But given the prince's existing commitment to saying the unsayable on any subject from grey goo to the power of coffee enemas, the acquisition of a throne seems more likely to inspire still greater flights of unfettered self-expression. At liberty to snub or flatter any political leader he chooses, King Charles III will be free to invite the entire Saudi royal family to hunt in St James's Park, to commission Quinlan Terry to beautify both the interior and facade of Buckingham Palace with ornamental pineapples, and - once a week! - to introduce prime ministers as yet unborn to the mysteries of integrated medicine, before reading to them, for hours at a time, from Shakespeare's Henry V or the King James Bible. There will no mummy to glare at him, no daddy to mock him, and more importantly, no interfering little Bollands where there should be only pleasing and agreeable favourites. No one will dare implore him to avoid controversy and ludicrous contradictions (such as helicopter travel and lectures on global warming). Mankind, in short, will be ready to receive his message. He will be our first absolute dissident."

These prayers are said in many churches (who'd have thought?), included Diana until 1996 (who knew?) and now mention only the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles. The palace responded that there were no plans to include the Duchess of Cornwall by name, though she was included ""by implication, because churchgoers pray in general to the royal family"" (who knew that?).It's a perfectly defensible decision by the Queen. The marriage between Charles and Camilla has any number of features that aren't particularly reputable - its genesis, for instance. Churchgoers may well object to praying for an adulteress (though they seem to be OK about praying for an adulterer). Some people would probably be upset at the insult to Diana's memory. Blah, blah and blah. They're all good reasons, but it's just not very Christian, is it?As we've seen from the myriad ambiguities of the pomp and semi-pomp surrounding this couple's union, there are no fixed rules where divorcees are concerned any more. The wife of the future king is not necessarily the future queen. The civil-ceremony nuptials of the future head of the church didn't, as it turned out, diminish his fitness for that job. The Queen can refuse to attend the ceremony, but still hold the reception.For all the dark foreboding while the pair were still just - gulp - lovers, none of this turned out to be any more far-reaching or constitutional than the kvetching of any other family about who pays for the bridesmaids' dresses. If the Queen wanted to have Camilla in the state prayers, there isn't a Diana-lover in all of England who could stop her. As it turns out, she'd rather not. Camilla has suffered so many snubs from this quirky woman she must be feeling pretty stoic, but it does make you wonder. Is a parish church the best place to vent a not-very-Christian decision, based on not-quite-forgiveness? Can't she just snub Camilla by inviting her to a cocktail party, but not to the dinner afterwards?This family doesn't just thrive on, it owes everything to, the delicately unasked question: how does it feel to be head of state with no political muscle? Does anyone get a shiver of embarrassment about being head of the church while having no obvious spiritual obligations? Is it a little bit weird to be bankrolled for foreign trips while pursuing your own business interests?Most of this refers to Prince Charles, I now realise, but doesn't a metaphorical plinth seem a bit jerry-built when, after you've been held aloft by the taxpayer, you start sniffing out tax loopholes as fervently as a cash-in-hand plasterer? More pertinent to the young princes, how would even a very intelligent youngster square an attempt to present a ""modern"" face with the fact that his very position is an anachronism?If the Queen thinks Camilla is too unsuitable a spouse to be named as such, why did she sanction the wedding? Ah, but she didn't - she just, you know, kind of did. That's this family all over. They don't want anything clarified. They treat contradictions like herpes - insoluble, unfortunate, but for God's sake don't mention them and, besides, didn't we all have fun getting into this mess?I had this argument once with someone who said tolerating ambiguity was the sign of a civilised society. It shut me up for a bit. But here, as in so many cases, ambiguity is just another word for bilge. Tolerating bilge is the sign of a lazy society. They're skating along on the carapace of our sloth, this family. I'm sure that's not what the divine right of kings was supposed to be about."
1,"In further sensational, never previously broadcast interviews, Princess Diana describes events which will astonish the public and cast yet further doubts on her husband's fitness to rule. The recordings were made by her voice coach, Peter Pension-Scheme, whose teaching methods included immortalising the Princess on compromising video tapes, which were left with him for safe-keeping. In one tape, he is heard encouraging her to discuss her troubled marriage: ""You must have been desperate for a real, red-blooded man, given that your everyday life was a desperate vortex of disappointment, bulimia and unbearable sexual frustration."" ""Yeah,"" Diana says. Pension-Scheme: ""Your husband wasn't really meeting your needs?""  The Princess laughs. ""Twice a year, birthdays and Christmas - and that was cancelled if either of them fell on the 13th of the month. Typical Libra."" Pension-Scheme asks: ""So you were forced to seek intimacy elsewhere?"" ""And how,"" Diana says, rolling her eyes. ""Couldn't get enough - until we were found out. Then it was curtains."" Although she does not mention any names, it is understood that she is referring to John Major, the former Tory prime minister.  Pension-Scheme: ""He's said to be a very well endowed man."" Diana giggles again. ""Shall we say I thought he was just drop dead gorgeous. I don't find it easy to discuss - but I used to fantasise about running away from all this, finding a little bungalow somewhere, and spending the rest of my life taking care of him - but it wasn't meant to be.""   Diana's intimate friendship with Mr Major is understood to have continued until he was thrown out of office in 1997. Asked if she thinks his electoral defeat had anything to do with MI5, Diana lowers her voice. ""With a little help from You Know Who. I didn't know anything about it until Labour had been in for three weeks. Charles just came in and told me they'd won. By a landslide. Typical."" Minutes later she had to put on her public face and go shopping. ""I was devastated. Threw both of us down the stairs. Total and utter stitch up. But there was no way of proving it.""  The outgoing Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, has ordered an investigation into claims of voting irregularities in the 1997 election.  Before she was due to make an important speech, Mr Pension-Scheme would urge Diana to focus on the most hurtful aspects of life with her husband, then imagine herself performing a seductive victory dance with Wayne Sleep. She says she was devastated to discover, during her engagement, that Charles snored. ""Too late to change my mind. Completely shattering. He said he wasn't going to be the first Prince of Wales not to snore. Utterly typical.""  Pension-Scheme: ""Anything really disgusting? On a totally confidential basis, obviously."" Diana pauses. ""The worst thing - never told a soul, just too dangerous - is the devil worshipping thing. Right from the start of our marriage, I'd hear these terrifying howls at Highgrove. Spine chilling. Charles used to say it was owls."" Refusing to accept this explanation, a frightened Diana contacted one of her clairvoyants, Evelina Chequebook. ""Evelina came down and said the place was emitting more high-potency evil than anywhere she'd ever experienced. Totally toxic. Did my head in. Told me I absolutely had to get the boys out of there, before they were sucked into it. Can you believe it?""  Mr Pension-Scheme asks what happened. ""Went to see the Top Lady, as I call her,"" Diana says. ""Said, I happen know for a fact that Charles and Camilla and the Van Cutsems are devil-worshipping in the quinsy garden."" But the Queen refused to intervene.""Just said, 'Oh   Charles is utterly insane. Always has been. Always will be.' I said, 'Insanity! I see mental instability of such magnitude in my role that you would never understand.' And that was it. Nada.""  The outgoing Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, has ordered an investigation into claims that a satanic cult is operating from Highgrove.  In another sensational confession, Diana says she discovered the location of Lord Lucan. Invited by Peter Pension-Scheme to share any empowering but deeply private experiences which might extend her vocal range, the Princess reveals that she has the power to track down missing people and objects. ""People who have passed on, they tell me stuff. Tracked Charles down once, with his Lady. Behind his faith shed. Boy, were they surprised. And an earring. And Elvis came through once, saying Lucan's not really dead at all. Got me so upset.""  ""Where is he now?"" Pension-Scheme interjects. ""What's the exact address?""  ""He's living under a false identity in -"" here the Princess checks herself. ""I can't tell you. Too risky. And he begged me not to expose him. Knows what he did was wrong, but he's trying to rebuild his life. Absolutely begged. I said OK. Left it to fate. I know what goes around comes around."" Asked if she has told anyone else about her psychic powers, Diana tells Mr Pension-Scheme that he's the first. ""I know I can trust you.""  On the basis of new evidence, Sir John Stevens has ordered a re-investigation of Lord Lucan's disappearance. <B>Who is the 'melons' man? </B> <BR>  Even as one sympathises with the women MPs who, as a new report alleges, have endured unforgiveable insults from male colleagues, their reluctance to disclose which individuals offered them £10,000 for sex (reported by Oona King), or shouted ""melons"" (Barbara Follett), or ""literally"" pinned them to a wall by the neck (unnamed woman MP), or expressed a desire to ""roger"" a nearby woman (reported by Jackie Ballard), is quite mystifying. Who are these men? If they are still in parliament, should they not be named, and if guilty, subjected to public emasculation without anaesthetic? Or at any rate, invited to step down. Not only is it wrong to protect these primitives, the steady drone of unresolved complaint, if it persists for much longer, might give people the unfortunate impression that many women MPs are disproportionately preoccupied with their own specialness and personal grievances. One is still grumbling about the ""public school atmosphere"". Yet another says she ""dreads"" PM's questions. Can nothing be done to help them? Some effective collective action might liberate female MPs and civilise rogue males, at the same time as encouraging women who regularly face worse treatment, in far harder circumstances, all over the country.  Unless one explanation for this apparent passivity is that many of the more lurid offences reported this week actually occurred years ago, long before the breast-feeding reforms and the changes in Commons hours and culture which now make the woman MP's lot the envy of many full-time workers with four weeks annual holiday. Although, as Dawn Primarolo suggested, it can still be difficult for women MPs to escape from work in order to watch their children play in rugby or football matches. I wonder if they have considered doing so during important parliamentary debates.   A debate, for example, like the one about David Blunkett's outrageous and ignorant proposal to restrict freedom of speech where it relates to religion. You couldn't help but notice, on Tuesday afternoon, that this long, non-boorish discussion did not feature a single contribution from a woman backbencher. Two female junior ministers spoke in defence of censorship. Perhaps there were some important matches on.    <B>Ridicule us too, please </B><BR>  Jackie Rowley, communications director for Charles Kennedy, emails to ask why the Lib Dem    leader's card did not feature in a piece, published earlier this week, about politicians' Christmas cards. ""Did you fail to mention the Kennedy card because it was too normal (and in aid of a constituency charity)?"" she asks. I see that lack of space is no excuse for ignoring Mr Kennedy's almost unimproveable Christmas card (in aid of the Highland Hospice in Inverness), which depicts a croft in the foreground and, behind it, the sunlit eminence of Glencoe, partially obscured by a line of horizontal cloud. I am conscious that there may be other cards which ought to be described in the Guardian. If so, do let me know.","In Blandings Castle and Elsewhere, PG Wodehouse recorded the sterling response of Beach, the butler, on discovering Lord Emsworth's son in a drawing room with a sack of rats in his hand.

Before she was due to make an important speech, Mr Pension-Scheme would urge Diana to focus on the most hurtful aspects of life with her husband, then imagine herself performing a seductive victory dance with Wayne Sleep. She says she was devastated to discover, during her engagement, that Charles snored. ""Too late to change my mind. Completely shattering. He said he wasn't going to be the first Prince of Wales not to snore. Utterly typical.""  Pension-Scheme: ""Anything really disgusting? On a totally confidential basis, obviously."" Diana pauses. ""The worst thing - never told a soul, just too dangerous - is the devil worshipping thing. Right from the start of our marriage, I'd hear these terrifying howls at Highgrove. Spine chilling. Charles used to say it was owls."" Refusing to accept this explanation, a frightened Diana contacted one of her clairvoyants, Evelina Chequebook. ""Evelina came down and said the place was emitting more high-potency evil than anywhere she'd ever experienced. Totally toxic. Did my head in. Told me I absolutely had to get the boys out of there, before they were sucked into it. Can you believe it?""  Mr Pension-Scheme asks what happened. ""Went to see the Top Lady, as I call her,"" Diana says. ""Said, I happen know for a fact that Charles and Camilla and the Van Cutsems are devil-worshipping in the quinsy garden."" But the Queen refused to intervene.""Just said, 'Oh   Charles is utterly insane. Always has been. Always will be.' I said, 'Insanity! I see mental instability of such magnitude in my role that you would never understand.' And that was it. Nada.""  The outgoing Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, has ordered an investigation into claims that a satanic cult is operating from Highgrove.  In another sensational confession, Diana says she discovered the location of Lord Lucan. Invited by Peter Pension-Scheme to share any empowering but deeply private experiences which might extend her vocal range, the Princess reveals that she has the power to track down missing people and objects. ""People who have passed on, they tell me stuff. Tracked Charles down once, with his Lady. Behind his faith shed. Boy, were they surprised. And an earring. And Elvis came through once, saying Lucan's not really dead at all. Got me so upset.""  ""Where is he now?"" Pension-Scheme interjects. ""What's the exact address?""  ""He's living under a false identity in -"" here the Princess checks herself. ""I can't tell you. Too risky. And he begged me not to expose him. Knows what he did was wrong, but he's trying to rebuild his life. Absolutely begged. I said OK. Left it to fate. I know what goes around comes around."" Asked if she has told anyone else about her psychic powers, Diana tells Mr Pension-Scheme that he's the first. ""I know I can trust you.""  On the basis of new evidence, Sir John Stevens has ordered a re-investigation of Lord Lucan's disappearance. <B>Who is the 'melons' man? </B> <BR>  Even as one sympathises with the women MPs who, as a new report alleges, have endured unforgiveable insults from male colleagues, their reluctance to disclose which individuals offered them £10,000 for sex (reported by Oona King), or shouted ""melons"" (Barbara Follett), or ""literally"" pinned them to a wall by the neck (unnamed woman MP), or expressed a desire to ""roger"" a nearby woman (reported by Jackie Ballard), is quite mystifying. Who are these men? If they are still in parliament, should they not be named, and if guilty, subjected to public emasculation without anaesthetic? Or at any rate, invited to step down. Not only is it wrong to protect these primitives, the steady drone of unresolved complaint, if it persists for much longer, might give people the unfortunate impression that many women MPs are disproportionately preoccupied with their own specialness and personal grievances. One is still grumbling about the ""public school atmosphere"". Yet another says she ""dreads"" PM's questions. Can nothing be done to help them? Some effective collective action might liberate female MPs and civilise rogue males, at the same time as encouraging women who regularly face worse treatment, in far harder circumstances, all over the country.  Unless one explanation for this apparent passivity is that many of the more lurid offences reported this week actually occurred years ago, long before the breast-feeding reforms and the changes in Commons hours and culture which now make the woman MP's lot the envy of many full-time workers with four weeks annual holiday. Although, as Dawn Primarolo suggested, it can still be difficult for women MPs to escape from work in order to watch their children play in rugby or football matches. I wonder if they have considered doing so during important parliamentary debates.   A debate, for example, like the one about David Blunkett's outrageous and ignorant proposal to restrict freedom of speech where it relates to religion. You couldn't help but notice, on Tuesday afternoon, that this long, non-boorish discussion did not feature a single contribution from a woman backbencher. Two female junior ministers spoke in defence of censorship. Perhaps there were some important matches on.    <B>Ridicule us too, please </B><BR>  Jackie Rowley, communications director for Charles Kennedy, emails to ask why the Lib Dem    leader's card did not feature in a piece, published earlier this week, about politicians' Christmas cards. ""Did you fail to mention the Kennedy card because it was too normal (and in aid of a constituency charity)?"" she asks. I see that lack of space is no excuse for ignoring Mr Kennedy's almost unimproveable Christmas card (in aid of the Highland Hospice in Inverness), which depicts a croft in the foreground and, behind it, the sunlit eminence of Glencoe, partially obscured by a line of horizontal cloud. I am conscious that there may be other cards which ought to be described in the Guardian. If so, do let me know.","B> The following correction appeared in the Observer's For the Record column, Sunday May 23 2004</B><BR><BR>'A bit rich, but no class' (Comment, below) said 'they shirk the philanthropy of their American counterparts, from Rockefeller and Carnegie onwards', Andrew Carnegie was actually a Scotsman, born in Dunfermline, Fife.

Funerals are difficult. Too basic, and they seem depressing. Too fussy, and they risk vulgarity. One remembers the apocryphal send-off for Woody Allen's grandfather, featuring a buffet table laden with 'a replica of the deceased in potato salad'. Last week, Chatsworth offered its idealised tableau of a British demise. A hearse bearing Andrew Cavendish, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, wound through parkland lined by ribbons of servants in black serge and starched white aprons. The spectacle summarised how the rich die, and how they live. Never, outside a Conrad Black dinner party, have so many below-stairs staff been gathered together. The scene could have been a flashback to the margarine-advert England of Stanley Baldwin, except that Chatsworth's 600 employees are closer to the cast of a club reps docusoap than to old retainers. Most work for the tourist trade, running playgrounds or supplying internet customers with 'Duke's hampers' (price £499, plus £7.95 delivery).  In 1799, the Duke's forebear was the fourth wealthiest man in Britain. Since then, the aristocracy, lacking the wit to invent unopenable milk cartons or flatpack tables, has slithered down the international rich lists. The modern toff has had to compress Adam Smith's three categories of landowner, businessman and labourer into one multi-purpose model. That is why the current Earl of Sandwich is stuffing tuna wraps and why the departing Duke of Devonshire was winged to his rest by short-order chefs from Jean-Pierre's Chatsworth bar.  These days, only tycoons and footballers exist like Bourbon kings. A £700 million lawsuit issued by Hollinger against Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, alleges that the Blacks' excesses included billing the firm for 'household staff, including chefs, senior butlers, butlers, under-butlers, chauffeurs and footmen.' The Blacks' invention of an Almanack de Gotha of the buttling classes intrigued the media less, however, than Lady Amiel-Black's tip to a Bergdorf Goodman store doorman.  It can't have been her creativity that rankled, since many journalists are more inventive with expenses claims. The fascination of the Blacks is, instead, their cocktail of grandeur and frugality, the rich people's traits that others most love to deride. The Duke of Devonshire, a humble man, gave to good causes in the noblesse oblige tradition of the 19th-century landowner, while Hollinger, so its lawsuit claims, paid or promised $250,000 to charities on behalf of Amiel-Black.  The rich are often stingy. Queen Mary was a kleptomaniac who helped herself to knick-knacks from other people's houses, while Ingvar Kamprad, the Ikea founder and the wealthiest man in the world, drives an ancient Volvo. Tycoons have tended, too, towards madness, partly because they can pay others to sustain their worst delusions. Hence the Mormon army employed by the dying Howard Hughes to swat any germ-bearing fly entering the airspaces near the sealed room where he lay watching Ice Station Zebra on a video loop.  Though often selfish and sometimes unhinged, the rich have seldom seemed so dislikeable as now. Maybe plutocrats have to try harder to impress. When anyone with a semi in the right bit of inner London is a millionaire, only dollar billionaires feel truly wealthy. And when the middle classes, too upper crust to dust, hire two million servants of their own, the oligarchy needs better status symbols. In the US, the co-founder of Microsoft has just arrived at a New Orleans conference in the world's largest private yacht. Paul Allen's acquisition has a deck the size of Old Trafford, a submarine in the hold and a fuel tank that takes $250,000 to fill. Think Barbara Amiel's charity budget in unleaded diesel.   Lower down the food chain of plutocracy, fat cats are thriving. Luc Vandevelde, of M&amp;S, received a £450,000 annual package for failing to beguile women with polyester suits and this spring's toeless tights. Vandevelde, though sacked, has so many other lucrative boardroom roles that he will barely make it through M&amp;S's five-items-only checkout.  Ken Clarke told me, when he was Chancellor, that he wished business leaders 'would show a decent level of restraint'. His departure from the Tory script was aimed at proto-fat cats such as Cedric Brown, who was paid like one of Lord Black's Shake'n'Vac army in comparison with today's CEOs. Ten years down the line, optimists dare to think that, if Gordon Brown gets to be Prime Minister, he will tax the rich an extra 1 per cent. That wish may be forlorn. So far, the Chancellor's tax and benefit policy has helped the worst-off and lifted 700,000 children out of poverty. But 3.6m others remain poor, and the income gap is being prised apart by a failure to redistribute wealth.  Reluctance to make the rich pay their share is partly down to the awe in which government holds new money. From the Beckhams to a record influx of foreign billionaires, high-rollers are lionised. The moderately wealthy don't complain, partly because a rentier lifestyle, once for the coked-up sons of earls, is now an aspiration for those with a Fulham postcode and a trust fund for the children. Poorer people are not, by instinct, jealous. And even if they were, militancy was neutered long ago by Thatcher.  Helping the rich is part of the national culture, just as buying the Big Issue, or giving money to beggars, is not. Those on average incomes tend to be embarrassed by the impoverished, while   cheerfully subsidising affluent dependents, such as the royal family. It would be wrong to think that Prince Charles is scaling down the monarchy's extravagance in his current visit to Mount Athos, a remote religious community he uses as a spiritual Champneys. The austere regime is leavened by the prince's habit of arriving, often on a yacht owned by the Latsis dynasty, with 30 suitcases, one police bodyguard, one folding bed, one satellite telephone and several coolboxes of Palace delicacies to replace the monks' inedible bean stew.  Supporting the royals has always been justified, however shakily, by the argument that they work for the public good. New plutocrats do not. With exceptions, such as the Sainsburys, they shirk the philanthropy of their American counterparts, from Rockefeller and Carnegie onwards. Unlike Edwardian aristocrats, they rarely feel compelled, by God, guilt or public duty, to plough an unnecessary penny back into the public domain.  Orwell's moneyed and ruling classes have impacted into one. Nancy Mitford's U and non-U categories are only for snobs with chilblains and defective heating systems. This is a society that disdains rank and prejudice, and which has just been promised a brand new equality commission to uphold high standards. And still, old hierarchies linger.  A hearse goes by, and few scoff at the battalions of retainers that watch it pass, or mock the self-reverence of the rich. Instead, there is a reflex twitch of nostalgia for feudal England. Maybe everyone is suffering from Trollope overload. Or perhaps the revamped squirarchy, custodian of art and purveyor of damson jam online, looks suddenly less alarming than new potentates."
1,"Nobody, of course, can go back to the beginning. That is an Irish legend lost among the bogs and mists of futility. But, as the chimera called ""peace"" slips and slides again, it is at least worth going back to the beginning of these Troubles (more modern than ancient). What did the British government think then? We know, because the 30-year rule opens the closed cabinet doors of 1969. Home secretary James Callaghan told his colleagues that: ""There is a good deal of corroboration for the view that the Catholics have acted in self-defence, and little evidence to support the view of the Northern Irish government that the IRA are mainly responsible."" Big Jim's officials reported widespread unionist gerrymandering, favouritism and seedy control over local authority housing. ""There are legitimate grievances and it is entirely legitimate that they should be ventilated by demonstration.""  Callaghan himself told the new Northern Irish prime minister that ""he must not rely on British military support in maintaining repressive policies"". Harold Wilson's private secretary reported bleakly that ""our main trouble is from the Protestants"". Defence secretary Healey blamed the RUC for the ""indiscriminate use of firearms, tear gas etc"" and the head of the British army described a police force ""which is behind the times, poorly led and administered, with a sadly inefficient special branch.""   In sum, as it seemed to the men and women gathered around the long table in Downing Street, this was a no-win game which the unionists, the triumphalists of the Orange Order, had started by their mindless choice of sectarian repression over liberal democracy. And now, yet again, the poor old mainland Brits were being summoned to sort things out in blood, sweat and tears.  You don't need to agree in detail with those ministers and witnesses of 30 years ago to see the point. Agreement about anything in Northern Ireland's past is probably an unattainable golal. But the cabinet minutes do paint a grisly picture of frustration and helpessness. They tell us, as troubled times returned, where an impotent government far away laid the (mostly private, teeth-grinding) blame. British imperialism? Wilson's team, even then, wished Belfast could be deemed independent and told to push off.  For once, too, the recent past has relevance to the present. It reminds us, as the IRA hangs on to its guns and another ""process"" of reconciliation threatens to go belly up - perhaps for many years - that it takes two to make a peace. It reminds us that nothing can really begin afresh without continuing compromise, exercised day after day until it becomes normality.  A few weeks ago one truce ended. Eta, the zealots of Basque nationalism, returned to blowing up cars in crowded streets and killing people. And some thing else returned to Spain, the squares of Madrid and Pamplona. Crowds a million-strong walked arm in arm, expressing their disgust, horror and defiance. The Spanish people made their voices heard and, in so doing, immediately isolated the tiny straggle of terrorists. It won't end their campaign, to be sure: but it does create a political context which puts the greatest pressure on them. The people, massed, have that power.  I wonder, though, where the people of Northern Ireland have gone through these few glum weeks of slithering failure. I wonder (extrapolating) what the rest of the people of Britain think, if they care. For it is the people who have gone missing again, ruled themselves out of this eqation.   They were there once, with their candlelit vigils and their funeral marches as the killings echoed on. Many gallant individuals began movements then and still persevere. But where is the great shout of anger? Where are streets filled end to end with crowds who put peace first? Where is the pressure, the blessed pressure, for change?   Gerry Adams was talking the other day about ""the undefeated army"" of the IRA. It wasn't a popular line, one promptly rubbished by all the usual suspects. But it is also a clinically accurate description. The IRA was not defeated, any more than the British army and the RUC were defeated. Neither side was winning or losing: the struggle was just going on, for decade after decade, without point or possible outcome. If it is now renewed, as it may well eventually be, the years ahead will only be filled with more pointless violence. The IRA cannot win; but nor - as those who confront them admit under their breath - can the security forces. There is no easy fix of internment. There is no possibility of totally isolating the terrorists where a sectarian divide still yawns. No solution: just more of the same. You might as well say the Russian army has settled the Chechen problem by flattening Grozny. Dream on!  So where are the people in their own hour of need? There is no doubt how they feel or what they want, passively. They continue, for the most part, to vote along traditional lines. They haven't transplanted the old heart of Northern Irish politics.  They have accepted the reluctances of the Aremy Council with resignation and more depressingly, done little to disrupt activist distrust of the unionist Council which now, apparently, will circumscribe David Trimble's room for manoeuvre still more chokingly. They have, in sum, left hope to others they   decline to influence directly. Too harsh? Certainly in individual terms (see the tortured exhaustion of Seamus Mallon) but a collective judgment remains more problematical. If both Councils now feel the wind of outrage at their backs, then anything yet remains possible. But if there is no such manifest fury, then that in itself will deliver an awful truth.  Exit Mo, enter Mandy; exit, one day, Tony, enter who-can-say? The heirs of Wilson and Callaghan over the water will keep toiling on, biting their lips, hiding their real feelings because words out of place invoke inevitable furies. But peace, real peace, has to be craved for on the ground, sought as the highest prize. Peace isn't about symbols - a few machine guns or tons of Semtex given up in a hollow show of ""disarmament"" in Kosovo mode. New guns can always be bought, new obstacles found among the fudged clauses of diplomacy. Peace is determination to live together come what may. Peace isn't a minefield of ifs and buts - and sitting back while the vested interests carry on conniving. Peace has to be worked for.  A million Spaniards realise that. They walk for a purpose. It is a bleak thing to say, but there will be no lasting peace for Ireland until more millions throng the streets of Belfast and Dublin (and yes, Manchester and Birmingham too). This, 30 years on with nothing to show, is our challenge and our responsibility. And one day we shall have to acknowledge that by taking the prize for ourselves.","After the perils of Pauline, the triumphs of Trimble. And with yet another bound, our unlikely hero is free, until the next time. The peace process is saved: mainland Britain switches its attention over to England against Brazil: Peter Mandelson prepares to concentrate on the next election campaign. A crisis averted becomes inside page news for yesterday's papers. This is politics as usual, which disguises the fact that there is nothing usual about Northern Irish politics. What, for instance, would any normal party leader do if his deputy drifted off to Taiwan for the vital days of decision-forming? What would Blair do to Prescott? He would drop big John into oblivion from a great height, not greet him home and fete him as some mighty prophet. Yet John Taylor, preened with self-importance, is hailed merely because he agrees to support his boss.  You don't have to be loyal to be a loyalist. Jeffrey Donaldson and the rejectionists, playing to a bizarre audience of 860 grandees, won't give up. Paisley's DUP will probably stalk away from the reconvened assembly and rail outside the walls. Even without the IRA's dumps of mystic verbiage, words put beyond use where Cyril Ramaphosa keeps his dictionary, the scope for trouble remains almost infinite.  It is painfully easy, amid such confusion, just to recite the word ""process"" as some kind of mantra and to forget what it means. Pause,   though. What is this peace process? It is a formula for reconciliation and quiet on the streets. It puts London and Dublin in a settled context. It persuades once mortal enemies to sit side by side as ministerial colleagues, deciding about jobs and schools and hospitals. By this transference of power, too, it seeks to make Ulster politics real at last, freed from a time warp of rhetoric and opposition posturings: the most necessary devolution of the lot.  But here there are other connections. Real politics also means winning and losing elections. It means change to the pulse of democracy - the eventual boot for Blair, the rise of the pensioner's friend. It involves ebb and flow.  We know that already from the matching devolutions of the last three years. Alun Michael has ebbed for ever. Donald Dewar may soon be gone with the flow. If you give voters assemblies and executives to elect, the voters become sovereign. You may make it difficult for them by installing the drag anchors of proportional representation: Scotland and Wales have those. They're stuck, by design, with coalition administrations.  They, though, can change the weighting of those coalitions and the faces who front them. One fine day, there'll be a Scots Nat chief minister in Edinburgh. One predictable day, Labour will be cut out of the Cardiff action. The question for Belfast, the hole in the heart of this process, is where the reality of politics bites there.   Let's assume that the assembly is back in business, stronger than before because of the worsting of Donaldson and the guarantees of the IRA. Trimble and his other (useful) deputy, Seamus Mallon, resume work: Martin McGuinness is more interested in A level results than Armalite stocks.  That, crucially, is the first base camp of reconciliation. Everybody who stood for election and still wants to play has a guaranteed part of the action. Badmouthing the British government doesn't stop the leaks in school roofs or improve ambulance response times. The focus inevitably shifts to practical policies and their delivery. Who cares about the Battle of the Boyne when there are jobs wanted now?  Getting there: got that. You could tell, even from the first few weeks of assembly life, how power and accountability can alter perspectives. (It's the old Yasser Arafat test: make him responsible for clean tap water and electrical supplies and he is seen in a different light.) The practical politicisation of politicians is the underpinning of peace.  But how, thereafter, does Northern Ireland move on the next camp, to the stage   where leaking school roofs or job losses bring electoral retribution? The difficulty with the Good Friday agreement is that it doesn't know: it never envisages a Bad Saturday. Our old chum d'Hondt, with his mathematical system to share out the fruits of proportional representation, operates relentlessly.  The assembly, monitored by equality commissioners, has inclusion engraved on its founding statutes. If you're one of the chosen 108, you have a stake: you have to register as a nationalist or a unionist or something other and your vote matters, by parallel consent or weighted majority, in the choice of every committee, every chairman, every minister.   It seems an odd question to put, but where is the opposition in such a controlled, infinitely balanced arena? Answer: except for Paisley, stomping on the lawn outside, there won't be an opposition that matters. The big boys within the walls are yoked together for all Good Fridays.  We ought to be clear that that fix, however essential it currently seems, is also a terrible snare. It freezes the religious divides and histories in another time warp. It makes party labels the key to power and seals them in their own little boxes. It purposely delays the moment when the Unionists or Sinn Fein or the SDLP will look out from their own sectarian audiences and begin to match their policies to the orientations of London or of Dublin. In short, to practise the real politics   which can free Northern Ireland from its infernal cocoon.  I want to see Sinn Fein's policy bag emptied on to the floor for wider inspection so that I can see how its old collection of sub-Marxist nostrums is changing (just as the ANC in South Africa has changed). I want to hear about hospital waiting lists and bobbies on the beat. I want to see David Trimble and Gerry Adams locked in debate about gay rights. I want a relevance which doesn't end at the ferry terminal. I would even (ye gods!) love a good row over the euro.  The latest wobbly triumph of Trimble is a million miles from such mundane joys. It is still locked in its own, claustrophobic cage, still absorbed with the symbolism of flags and guns fallen silent but not destroyed: the whether, not the how. In mainland Britain, we have handed in all our guns, because that is the law. In Belfast, the legacy of Dunblane doesn't count. The debate remains wholly internalised.  Devolution, within the United Kingdom, means finding a different kind of balance. It means finding a matching political system that fits. It means the political ability to talk about the same things in the same tone of voice and to exact the same kind of electoral punishment in failure. That is the only real culmination of what we glibly call the ""peace process"". A new rhythm and new beginning which one distant day may be called normality.  <BR>Peter Preston"

That's the sense that screams from the positions taken by either side. Both are gripped by what they see as matters of inalienable substance: the substance of arms, of lifelong passion, of sanctified conviction, of justified mistrust, above all the substance of history. Could any two men on the face of the planet be deeper dug in behind impermeable rocks of actuality? But when you look at it, what their argument most seems is unreal. Consider Mr Trimble and his party. They have already come a long way. They wanted the Good Friday deal, and their leader has taken some risks to keep it alive. They know, also, that the IRA will never give up all its weapons. They knew that all along. It is one of the givens they have learned to tolerate, as they contemplate sitting alongside former killers and torturers on the Northern Ireland executive.  They well understand, even if Sinn Fein-IRA were to hand over some weapons now, and make a pledge on decommissioning later, that arms will remain. The possibility of re-starting hostilities will be there, moving out from arms dumps whose location the IRA has presumably mapped with greater exactness than it did the murder-graves of 20 years ago.  Knowing this, the Ulster Unionists none the less sat down with Sinn Fein-IRA, and talked about a future that, as everyone silently understood, encompassed it. They did this because they believed the process would assist the outcome, saying, in effect, that politics should be allowed to take over, and that this experience in itself would begin to render the arms redundant. This was the point of Good Friday. With the growth of politics, battle would finally cease.  Yet, having swallowed all that, which required an impressive if long-delayed magnanimity on the Unionists' part, they are now balking. They can't make the final stride. They refuse to let the executive start functioning unless this is preceded by some tiny sign from the other side. The camel is digested, but the gnat sticks immovably in the throat.  Republicans too, however, are masters of the artificial point. By offering this tiny sign, they would lose nothing. The scenario which the Unionists have privately conceded acknowledges that some weaponry would always, in the real world, remain. Certainly a great deal of it would still be there next week and next month if, this week, the IRA were to meet Mr Blair's deadline and launch a decommissioning process. For all that is asked of them, to keep momentum going, is a token, in effect a nullity, a symbolic act: a gesture of entirely artificial importance.  Yet they cannot do it. And people humour them in the not-doing of it. They established some time ago, especially among mainland opinion that is anywhere close to the government, that they could not be expected to do it. History entirely ruled it out. Those of us who wrote in the opposite sense - said that some little gesture of symbolic disarming was a sine qua non which Unionists were entitled to rely on - were given lectures about our regrettable insensitivity and our woeful lack of realism.  Sinn Fein-IRA has, like the Unionists, come quite far. It accepted the consent principle, protecting the democratic rights of the Ulster majority. It complied with the impulse in Dublin to redefine the constitutional objective of a united Ireland. It embarked on a process which implicitly conceded that its departed heroes had fought and died in a struggle that could no longer be won by military means.  But Mr Adams too, like Mr Trimble, goes to the wire quite willing, it would seem, to jeopardise all this by his resistance to a very small point. Actually, of the two, Sinn Fein's sabotage, if this is what it proves to be, is the more culpable. It has seized more, while offering less. It has got many of its killers out of prison early, but is not prepared even to urge that decommissioning should happen. While insisting on its separateness from the IRA, it will not expend so much as a single word telling the IRA what it thinks it should do.  Sinn Fein, in other words, will take hardly any risks. We assume that Mr Adams is desperate for Good Friday to survive, but he exhibits no equivalent public urgency. While goading Mr Trimble to take one more risk, he affects to believe that for his part it is not within his power to take the one everyone wants him to, because he continues to shelter behind the claim - the insulting fiction - that he carries no influence with the IRA. Judged by where it now stands, the negotiation has been one-sided in the concessions made, while sustaining the ridiculous pretence that any party close to a paramilitary group could not bring about sufficient decommissioning to allow the peace process to continue and the institutions to start work  All the same, the points at issue remain definable by that word: artificial. Taking the process as a whole, their reality does not accord in any way with the scale of the prize that is otherwise available. Both sides have expended great effort, alongside the British and Irish governments, to achieve a change that has eluded these islands for 30 years - to name but the most recent fragment of time. It would now take only a small shift by either or both of them to enable the larger deal to make a measure of progress.  It is tempting to say this has to come from Sinn Fein. For while it is certainly easier to say what Mr Trimble should do - to tell him, with lofty disregard for his viability as leader of a functioning party, to move ahead without any decommissioning gesture from the other side -Sinn Fein's recalcitrance has been the more unyielding, and therefore the more culpably calamitous for the project its leaders want to see succeed.  What is more striking than the fault to be found in one side or the other, however, is the failure they share: their absence of perspective in the end-game. Must the gnats have another accursed victory? This is what today and tomorrow will have to be about. A venture that has seen, from all sides, a fair amount of largeness - reluctant and chippy and unadmitted, but also large - is in danger of collapsing round points that are not, in the broad scheme of things already accomplished, either large or real. Perhaps this is a definition of the Irish problem. But that is what seemed so close to being re-defined."
1,"There is hard news and soft news, according to the sainted John Humphrys. (He likes the hard stuff; his BBC employers have gone soft at Six). But you can split categories of news every which way - including, as Mo Mowlam might add, real news; the news where reality bites. Consider: I'm sitting a few weeks ago with a very senior copper discussing the aftermath of the Jill Dando murder. Where did the hit man buy his gun? Surely Jack Straw's dynamic ban on gun ownership has made the whole firearms scene much tighter?  Not really, says top cop reflectively. He can rattle out a long list of pubs where anyone with a wad of fivers can pick up a pistol in 30 minutes flat. Laws don't get in the way of trade. The Straw package may make life tougher for deranged amateurs: fewer guns in legal circulation mean fewer fumbling fingers on triggers. But don't, for a second, suppose that the professionally determined are much incommoded. There's a sharp bang a couple of streets away as I leave. A dodgy exhaust - or a touring Yardie?  In other words, if you want a gun and know where to look for it, the underworld is your oyster. Parliament can pass laws till kingdom come - but, for the drug runners, bank robbers and terrorists, life and death continue as though nothing had happened. And if that's true in the east end of London or Manchester Moss Side, it must be even truer in Belfast (where the Straw law, remember, doesn't run anyway).  Did anyone seriously suppose that the Good Friday agreement would lead to complete disarmament along the back alleys and side roads of Northern Ireland? Did David Trimble suppose that the IRA would turn in every last armalite and stash of grenades? Did Gerry Adams suppose that the UVF and the rest wouldn't forget to turn in the hardware under the floorboards?  Of course not. They 're talking symbolism, not reality. See how, across Europe, the Kosovo Liberation Army claims to have met its own disarmament obligations. Nobody believes that - and the murder of Serbs continues unabated. Kosovo, in any case, is a vast dump of weaponry left behind: enough to keep the black markets of the west stocked for years.  Even if the IRA, in some unimaginable circumstance, turned in every last gun tomorrow, it could be up and shooting again in three months. The reality of peace isn't turning revolvers into ploughshares: it is, slowly, painfully, ensuring that fingers slide away from the triggers.  But unreality, alas, is so much easier to play with; the mouthings of unreality glide so much less painfully from political lips. And one unreality feeds on another. Thus the unreality of a symbolic start to disarmament (which wasn't in the agreement to begin with) leads, over stretching time, to a deliberative pause in which our secretary of state is required to deem the ceasefire firm or illusory. Mo Mowlam does what she was always going to do, what she had no option but to do. She deems the process battered but fundamentally intact.  The IRA have not taken up guns again against the army or the police or the leaders of unionism. There has been no return to sectarian killing. The gangs and the protection racketeers are still operating with some brutality. But no Good Friday words on paper ever could or ever will do much about that - just as no words of Straw, transmuted by parliamentary draftsmen, could stop Dando's murderer going to a pub he'd heard about from the friend of a friend. The essential, basic peace remains.  Again: everybody intimately involved knows this. David Trimble, first minister designate of Northern Ireland, knows it. Even the suddenly omnipresent Jeffrey Donaldson, Ulster Unionist MP, knows it. The roars of outrage and threats of legal action, the prating calls for Mo Mowlam's head, are ritualistic and synthetic. They are either a way for weak men of moderate goodwill to hang on to power in the hope that better times will come - or a thinly disguised attempt to wreck the agreement and shelve every vestige of what process remains by men who never wanted peace on these terms in the first place.  The real news is that divide and that debate: not the flummery of fury. And the real issue behind it needs to be put still more starkly - in a way that even John Humphrys might quail over.  Back to my truth-telling top cop. Can we (I once asked him, in the darker days before Good Friday) ever defeat the IRA? Can our army ever bring peace at the point of a gun? Is there a military answer of enforcement and internment and massive policing which is the alternative to accommodation and compromise?  Straight questions: straight answer. No, there isn't an alternative. Good intelligence can abate the violence for a while, but it can't stop it.  There is no law and order solution here (any more than a large army billeted in Kosovo can prevent ethnic cleansings or simple gangsterism). The alternative to the way things are is a return to the way things were.  Two years ago, both sides implicitly recognised that. Nobody was winning and nobody losing. The conflict was just pottering bloodily on, in increasing futility. So there was a halt (perhaps, says my wise copper, only the first of several as the lessons are gradually learned). But time, in the passing, is another enemy here. Men with guns and politicians with restive constituencies forget. They load back the unreality. George Mitchell becomes a strolling player, not a saviour. The words of hope become ever more strained, the deadlines ever more malleable.  The devil of the situation, though, is that the truth of our impotence in all its bleakness can never be voiced openly by those who understand. Neither Tony Blair nor Mo Mowlam can admit the inability of the state apparatus they control to impose a solution - and the Conservatives have all too swiftly forgotten what they learned through 18 bitter years.  The ordinary people of Northern Ireland are left darkling among the posturers and the bigots. The ordinary voters of the rest of the UK are given no chance to tell the minority over the water what they think should be done.  Real news? Real news gives you the real options and the real assessments - and confronts you with the real decisions. Real news gags on the surface show and shrugs off facile connections to four frightened lads in Dungannon. Real news deals in the fundamentals of life and death. Harder than hard, truer than truer. But there isn't, it seems, much of it around - at Six or any other spot on the clock.","Nobody, of course, can go back to the beginning. That is an Irish legend lost among the bogs and mists of futility. But, as the chimera called ""peace"" slips and slides again, it is at least worth going back to the beginning of these Troubles (more modern than ancient). What did the British government think then? We know, because the 30-year rule opens the closed cabinet doors of 1969. Home secretary James Callaghan told his colleagues that: ""There is a good deal of corroboration for the view that the Catholics have acted in self-defence, and little evidence to support the view of the Northern Irish government that the IRA are mainly responsible."" Big Jim's officials reported widespread unionist gerrymandering, favouritism and seedy control over local authority housing. ""There are legitimate grievances and it is entirely legitimate that they should be ventilated by demonstration.""  Callaghan himself told the new Northern Irish prime minister that ""he must not rely on British military support in maintaining repressive policies"". Harold Wilson's private secretary reported bleakly that ""our main trouble is from the Protestants"". Defence secretary Healey blamed the RUC for the ""indiscriminate use of firearms, tear gas etc"" and the head of the British army described a police force ""which is behind the times, poorly led and administered, with a sadly inefficient special branch.""   In sum, as it seemed to the men and women gathered around the long table in Downing Street, this was a no-win game which the unionists, the triumphalists of the Orange Order, had started by their mindless choice of sectarian repression over liberal democracy. And now, yet again, the poor old mainland Brits were being summoned to sort things out in blood, sweat and tears.  You don't need to agree in detail with those ministers and witnesses of 30 years ago to see the point. Agreement about anything in Northern Ireland's past is probably an unattainable golal. But the cabinet minutes do paint a grisly picture of frustration and helpessness. They tell us, as troubled times returned, where an impotent government far away laid the (mostly private, teeth-grinding) blame. British imperialism? Wilson's team, even then, wished Belfast could be deemed independent and told to push off.  For once, too, the recent past has relevance to the present. It reminds us, as the IRA hangs on to its guns and another ""process"" of reconciliation threatens to go belly up - perhaps for many years - that it takes two to make a peace. It reminds us that nothing can really begin afresh without continuing compromise, exercised day after day until it becomes normality.  A few weeks ago one truce ended. Eta, the zealots of Basque nationalism, returned to blowing up cars in crowded streets and killing people. And some thing else returned to Spain, the squares of Madrid and Pamplona. Crowds a million-strong walked arm in arm, expressing their disgust, horror and defiance. The Spanish people made their voices heard and, in so doing, immediately isolated the tiny straggle of terrorists. It won't end their campaign, to be sure: but it does create a political context which puts the greatest pressure on them. The people, massed, have that power.  I wonder, though, where the people of Northern Ireland have gone through these few glum weeks of slithering failure. I wonder (extrapolating) what the rest of the people of Britain think, if they care. For it is the people who have gone missing again, ruled themselves out of this eqation.   They were there once, with their candlelit vigils and their funeral marches as the killings echoed on. Many gallant individuals began movements then and still persevere. But where is the great shout of anger? Where are streets filled end to end with crowds who put peace first? Where is the pressure, the blessed pressure, for change?   Gerry Adams was talking the other day about ""the undefeated army"" of the IRA. It wasn't a popular line, one promptly rubbished by all the usual suspects. But it is also a clinically accurate description. The IRA was not defeated, any more than the British army and the RUC were defeated. Neither side was winning or losing: the struggle was just going on, for decade after decade, without point or possible outcome. If it is now renewed, as it may well eventually be, the years ahead will only be filled with more pointless violence. The IRA cannot win; but nor - as those who confront them admit under their breath - can the security forces. There is no easy fix of internment. There is no possibility of totally isolating the terrorists where a sectarian divide still yawns. No solution: just more of the same. You might as well say the Russian army has settled the Chechen problem by flattening Grozny. Dream on!  So where are the people in their own hour of need? There is no doubt how they feel or what they want, passively. They continue, for the most part, to vote along traditional lines. They haven't transplanted the old heart of Northern Irish politics.  They have accepted the reluctances of the Aremy Council with resignation and more depressingly, done little to disrupt activist distrust of the unionist Council which now, apparently, will circumscribe David Trimble's room for manoeuvre still more chokingly. They have, in sum, left hope to others they   decline to influence directly. Too harsh? Certainly in individual terms (see the tortured exhaustion of Seamus Mallon) but a collective judgment remains more problematical. If both Councils now feel the wind of outrage at their backs, then anything yet remains possible. But if there is no such manifest fury, then that in itself will deliver an awful truth.  Exit Mo, enter Mandy; exit, one day, Tony, enter who-can-say? The heirs of Wilson and Callaghan over the water will keep toiling on, biting their lips, hiding their real feelings because words out of place invoke inevitable furies. But peace, real peace, has to be craved for on the ground, sought as the highest prize. Peace isn't about symbols - a few machine guns or tons of Semtex given up in a hollow show of ""disarmament"" in Kosovo mode. New guns can always be bought, new obstacles found among the fudged clauses of diplomacy. Peace is determination to live together come what may. Peace isn't a minefield of ifs and buts - and sitting back while the vested interests carry on conniving. Peace has to be worked for.  A million Spaniards realise that. They walk for a purpose. It is a bleak thing to say, but there will be no lasting peace for Ireland until more millions throng the streets of Belfast and Dublin (and yes, Manchester and Birmingham too). This, 30 years on with nothing to show, is our challenge and our responsibility. And one day we shall have to acknowledge that by taking the prize for ourselves."

Funerals are difficult. Too basic, and they seem depressing. Too fussy, and they risk vulgarity. One remembers the apocryphal send-off for Woody Allen's grandfather, featuring a buffet table laden with 'a replica of the deceased in potato salad'. Last week, Chatsworth offered its idealised tableau of a British demise. A hearse bearing Andrew Cavendish, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, wound through parkland lined by ribbons of servants in black serge and starched white aprons. The spectacle summarised how the rich die, and how they live. Never, outside a Conrad Black dinner party, have so many below-stairs staff been gathered together. The scene could have been a flashback to the margarine-advert England of Stanley Baldwin, except that Chatsworth's 600 employees are closer to the cast of a club reps docusoap than to old retainers. Most work for the tourist trade, running playgrounds or supplying internet customers with 'Duke's hampers' (price £499, plus £7.95 delivery).  In 1799, the Duke's forebear was the fourth wealthiest man in Britain. Since then, the aristocracy, lacking the wit to invent unopenable milk cartons or flatpack tables, has slithered down the international rich lists. The modern toff has had to compress Adam Smith's three categories of landowner, businessman and labourer into one multi-purpose model. That is why the current Earl of Sandwich is stuffing tuna wraps and why the departing Duke of Devonshire was winged to his rest by short-order chefs from Jean-Pierre's Chatsworth bar.  These days, only tycoons and footballers exist like Bourbon kings. A £700 million lawsuit issued by Hollinger against Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, alleges that the Blacks' excesses included billing the firm for 'household staff, including chefs, senior butlers, butlers, under-butlers, chauffeurs and footmen.' The Blacks' invention of an Almanack de Gotha of the buttling classes intrigued the media less, however, than Lady Amiel-Black's tip to a Bergdorf Goodman store doorman.  It can't have been her creativity that rankled, since many journalists are more inventive with expenses claims. The fascination of the Blacks is, instead, their cocktail of grandeur and frugality, the rich people's traits that others most love to deride. The Duke of Devonshire, a humble man, gave to good causes in the noblesse oblige tradition of the 19th-century landowner, while Hollinger, so its lawsuit claims, paid or promised $250,000 to charities on behalf of Amiel-Black.  The rich are often stingy. Queen Mary was a kleptomaniac who helped herself to knick-knacks from other people's houses, while Ingvar Kamprad, the Ikea founder and the wealthiest man in the world, drives an ancient Volvo. Tycoons have tended, too, towards madness, partly because they can pay others to sustain their worst delusions. Hence the Mormon army employed by the dying Howard Hughes to swat any germ-bearing fly entering the airspaces near the sealed room where he lay watching Ice Station Zebra on a video loop.  Though often selfish and sometimes unhinged, the rich have seldom seemed so dislikeable as now. Maybe plutocrats have to try harder to impress. When anyone with a semi in the right bit of inner London is a millionaire, only dollar billionaires feel truly wealthy. And when the middle classes, too upper crust to dust, hire two million servants of their own, the oligarchy needs better status symbols. In the US, the co-founder of Microsoft has just arrived at a New Orleans conference in the world's largest private yacht. Paul Allen's acquisition has a deck the size of Old Trafford, a submarine in the hold and a fuel tank that takes $250,000 to fill. Think Barbara Amiel's charity budget in unleaded diesel.   Lower down the food chain of plutocracy, fat cats are thriving. Luc Vandevelde, of M&amp;S, received a £450,000 annual package for failing to beguile women with polyester suits and this spring's toeless tights. Vandevelde, though sacked, has so many other lucrative boardroom roles that he will barely make it through M&amp;S's five-items-only checkout.  Ken Clarke told me, when he was Chancellor, that he wished business leaders 'would show a decent level of restraint'. His departure from the Tory script was aimed at proto-fat cats such as Cedric Brown, who was paid like one of Lord Black's Shake'n'Vac army in comparison with today's CEOs. Ten years down the line, optimists dare to think that, if Gordon Brown gets to be Prime Minister, he will tax the rich an extra 1 per cent. That wish may be forlorn. So far, the Chancellor's tax and benefit policy has helped the worst-off and lifted 700,000 children out of poverty. But 3.6m others remain poor, and the income gap is being prised apart by a failure to redistribute wealth.  Reluctance to make the rich pay their share is partly down to the awe in which government holds new money. From the Beckhams to a record influx of foreign billionaires, high-rollers are lionised. The moderately wealthy don't complain, partly because a rentier lifestyle, once for the coked-up sons of earls, is now an aspiration for those with a Fulham postcode and a trust fund for the children. Poorer people are not, by instinct, jealous. And even if they were, militancy was neutered long ago by Thatcher.  Helping the rich is part of the national culture, just as buying the Big Issue, or giving money to beggars, is not. Those on average incomes tend to be embarrassed by the impoverished, while   cheerfully subsidising affluent dependents, such as the royal family. It would be wrong to think that Prince Charles is scaling down the monarchy's extravagance in his current visit to Mount Athos, a remote religious community he uses as a spiritual Champneys. The austere regime is leavened by the prince's habit of arriving, often on a yacht owned by the Latsis dynasty, with 30 suitcases, one police bodyguard, one folding bed, one satellite telephone and several coolboxes of Palace delicacies to replace the monks' inedible bean stew.  Supporting the royals has always been justified, however shakily, by the argument that they work for the public good. New plutocrats do not. With exceptions, such as the Sainsburys, they shirk the philanthropy of their American counterparts, from Rockefeller and Carnegie onwards. Unlike Edwardian aristocrats, they rarely feel compelled, by God, guilt or public duty, to plough an unnecessary penny back into the public domain.  Orwell's moneyed and ruling classes have impacted into one. Nancy Mitford's U and non-U categories are only for snobs with chilblains and defective heating systems. This is a society that disdains rank and prejudice, and which has just been promised a brand new equality commission to uphold high standards. And still, old hierarchies linger.  A hearse goes by, and few scoff at the battalions of retainers that watch it pass, or mock the self-reverence of the rich. Instead, there is a reflex twitch of nostalgia for feudal England. Maybe everyone is suffering from Trollope overload. Or perhaps the revamped squirarchy, custodian of art and purveyor of damson jam online, looks suddenly less alarming than new potentates."
1,"Think of life as a twoway Mirror. On the one side, as we shall discover this week, stands the erstwhile editor of the Daily Eponymous, keeping a beady-eyed diary for rapid sale and Fleet Street serialisation. Piers Morgan dubs Cherie Blair ""breathtakingly capricious and vindictive"" (she's not much turned on by Piers) - if not ""in the grip of personality disorder"" (make that totally turned off ). But equally, Mr Morgan tells Daily Mail readers, Tony Blair himself is ""inherently charming, nice, polite and well mannered"". Apparently, Piers used to give the PM the benefit of his experience, man-to-man. ""She causes you so much trouble,"" he'd say. He fears that the true victim of this political marriage is T Blair himself, ""because ultimately it's the Blair brand that's damaged"". Well, you can certainly draw some broken-brand conclusions from Labour's latest internal pollings. There, the leader's personal popularity with married women voters is down by six points. He's in almost as much bother as the Prince of Wales, whom only 31% of us now want to be king (when YouGov comes calling). Step, though, to the other side of the mirror. Look out rather than in, for the difference is instructive. What do Mr and Mrs Blair feel when they stare at the menacing world beyond? Pressure, of course: transient editors preparing to make a quick buck, rivals spreading poison, enemies stoking up every lecture tour or house purchase or personal friendship into some crisis of judgment. And careers - like the prospect of becoming a judge - going down the pan, flushed onward by so much detritus. For once, though, put all the usual arguments about future privacy to one side and concentrate on what remains - fixed here, today. The fact is that the Blairs are still firmly together, whatever the pressures; and that nice, polite, charming Tony seems as committed as ever. In short, this is a strong relationship toiled for and staunchly defended on both sides. Is that quite the message as currently conveyed? What about Blair the sophist, the acolyte of Bush, the betrayer of the faith, the quasi-president, the actor and smooth PR merchant? All or some of that may be true. But if marital wobbles at the top matter, then this look through the mirror tells us something useful, something most of us can relate to. Score one for commitment. Score one for not backing away when problems mount. And so we step inside the walls of Windsor. ""All my life, people have been telling me what to do, and I'm tired of it,"" Prince Charles wails to Gavin Hewitt in a new book. ""My private life has become an industry. People are making money out of it."" (Just so: that's what books are for.) ""I thought the British people were supposed to be compassionate. I don't see much sign of it.""   Typical whingeing from an over-privileged anachronism who betrayed a nation's sweetheart and still wants it all? Perhaps. But, one more time, look outward through that two-way mirror. If you do, you may conclude that there has never been anything but public grief for Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles through three decades of disappointment and tumult. The palace, in its uttermost reaches, recoiled at the first liaison. They found the heir to the throne a wholly unsuitable virgin bride and propelled him to the altar: one wedding, two victims. They did nothing to help any sliver of that marriage succeed. They were chill and manipulative throughout - and the prince was weak. But he has been strong about Camilla, when it would have been so easy to slide away. This is another enduring partnership, because it has endured so much. Now it must endure the careless coldness of a mother and father who don't grasp what ordinary human relationships are about and the publicity-grabbing cavortions of assorted priests fresh from the latest C of E disaster. Now compassion, in the family or the nation, is off the menu. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today, in the YouGov court of public opinion. Which is where, for a second, we should also pause. Most of us, if we're honest, know that staunchness and love walk side by side. We know there's a quality there, a branding that doesn't fade. And, if we value one quality in a cacophony without much compassion, then it's good to look through the mirror and see it still intact. Not the whole of the story, to be sure: but some of it. For intrusion, you see, has its uses.","Your starter for 10, Herr von Ribbentrop...How, one fine day, will the house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (UK division) come to dust? How will our royals reach the end of their line? It's a perennial question for historians, politicians, spooks. The trouble is that the answer keeps changing. After 1936 - the closest shave so far - you'd have said that Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson could do the job double-handed. There was the British establishment, flat on its back. There (an enterprising Guardian investigation now reveals) was the FBI, sure that Wallis Simpson had become a Nazi spy, prone to whisper sweet somethings in Von Ribbentrop's ear. Treachery and sex, primed to explode. Could any republican have asked for more?  Yet, even then, even in that extremity, it didn't happen. Baldwin greased the slipway, Churchill wafted the dubious duo off to the Bahamas. J Edgar Hoover declined to leak his suspicions to the press. Had Hoover, as usual, got his plots in a twist? Probably, Mrs bin Simpson. The main thing about the duke and duchess wasn't their duplicity, but their invincible stupidity. They went off to Germany together to study ""low-cost housing"". They had tea with Hitler in Berchtesgaden. They joked with Goering about the map in his library which somehow didn't include Austria. ""Ho, ho,"" said the field-marshal, jowls shaking with mirth, ""I needed a new map, and since Austria will soon join Germany - voluntarily of course - it seemed more economical to anticipate the event."" And the duchess, in her own memoirs, wrote all of this rancid stuff down.  Never underestimate the dogged strength of royal stability pacts. They paper over every imbecility. They distract and move on. They give the institution of monarchy a resilience which stretches far beyond rationality.  No, the Windsors will not easily go this way. But, since all dynasties depart at some time, the question remains: how will they go? Here the winds of changing opinion blow.  There will not, as constitutional reformers such as Charter 88 once fondly believed, come a decisive moment when a government of the left decides to cleanse our body politic of its flummeries. The case for cleaning away the dung of deference is as strong as it ever was; but the force is not with it. You can publish pamphlets till kingdom come - but, in practice, the kingdom won't be moved.  Nor, frankly, will personality disorders of the kind which surrounded the death of Diana bring the monarchy down. We've seen what happens in the wake of such PR disasters: a new team of spin doctors is recruited, a new PR pitch smoothly developed. There's no natural close to such a recycling process. Pay the right man the right money and you can survive indefinitely.  In fact, it now emerges, the true threat to continuance lies elsewhere - in the vociferous advice of those who claim to be the royal family's greatest friends and defenders. Take, for instance, the Daily Mail, puffed with triumphalism after the Queen Mother's funeral and a golden party of a jubilee - and cheerfully duffing up this paper for trying to rain on such parades. Well, fair enough ... but then the Mail leads the charge against Princess Pushy and her £69-a-week Kensington Palace apartment. Pushy and Bushy, a new pair of royals on the make to revile. It's a scandal. MPs begin sounding off, the pressure grows.   This isn't a Guardian campaign, though. It's a Mail campaign. The damage, however, could hardly be greater. Love and affection for HM, as commodiously chronicled at the start of June, turns swiftly to carping about the greed and arrogance of her family. She who was strong after 50 years is made to seem weak again. But what is the charge here, what's the offence? Of family looking after family, of more fortunate and moneyed Windsors taking care of the weaker brothers and sisters? It seems a slightly bizarre crusade from the ultimate newspaper of self-help and family values.  The thesis, expounded a few days ago when the keeper of the privy purse - formerly of KPMG and not, praise heaven, Arthur Andersen - published his household accounts, is that you can keep the palace show on the road if you deliver good accounting value. Wine bills down from £135,000 to £97,000 year on year. (Out with the fine Bordeaux, in with South African merlot.) Helicopters down from £2m to £1.9m. Crockery and cutlery down from £16,000 to £11,000 - but stationery up from £14,000 to £22,000. And so on, in close detail. What you lose on the fire insurance premiums you try to make up on flowers, photocopying and second-class postage. Now, if they could only stop washing the sheets so often!  The headline calculation from this exercise - the figure that puts the squeeze on Pushy's £69 - is that keeping our royals in the manner accustomed costs every Joe Citizen 58p a year. Good value as long as you can keep selling surplus carriages and keep staff wages down by paying them in minor gongs rather than money.  But step back for a second and ask that bigger question again. If this is the kind of majesty we want, why not crown the comptroller and auditor general instead? The jubilee wasn't a success because we counted every sparkler; it was a success because we spent loads and loads of cash. Our monarchs don't travel EasyJet; they cost nearly £4m a year buzzing around.  Royal household wisdom. The Windsors are conspicuous consumers. That is their way and our way with them. Holding their contract cleaning bills up to the light won't save them - to the contrary. Down the pan and round the bend with Tesco's own label Harpic substitute? Salvation isn't value for money. Salvation is living and playing rich, salvation is looking down, not adding up - as even Mrs Simpson was bright enough the understand."
0,"Think of life as a twoway Mirror. On the one side, as we shall discover this week, stands the erstwhile editor of the Daily Eponymous, keeping a beady-eyed diary for rapid sale and Fleet Street serialisation. Piers Morgan dubs Cherie Blair ""breathtakingly capricious and vindictive"" (she's not much turned on by Piers) - if not ""in the grip of personality disorder"" (make that totally turned off ). But equally, Mr Morgan tells Daily Mail readers, Tony Blair himself is ""inherently charming, nice, polite and well mannered"". Apparently, Piers used to give the PM the benefit of his experience, man-to-man. ""She causes you so much trouble,"" he'd say. He fears that the true victim of this political marriage is T Blair himself, ""because ultimately it's the Blair brand that's damaged"". Well, you can certainly draw some broken-brand conclusions from Labour's latest internal pollings. There, the leader's personal popularity with married women voters is down by six points. He's in almost as much bother as the Prince of Wales, whom only 31% of us now want to be king (when YouGov comes calling). Step, though, to the other side of the mirror. Look out rather than in, for the difference is instructive. What do Mr and Mrs Blair feel when they stare at the menacing world beyond? Pressure, of course: transient editors preparing to make a quick buck, rivals spreading poison, enemies stoking up every lecture tour or house purchase or personal friendship into some crisis of judgment. And careers - like the prospect of becoming a judge - going down the pan, flushed onward by so much detritus. For once, though, put all the usual arguments about future privacy to one side and concentrate on what remains - fixed here, today. The fact is that the Blairs are still firmly together, whatever the pressures; and that nice, polite, charming Tony seems as committed as ever. In short, this is a strong relationship toiled for and staunchly defended on both sides. Is that quite the message as currently conveyed? What about Blair the sophist, the acolyte of Bush, the betrayer of the faith, the quasi-president, the actor and smooth PR merchant? All or some of that may be true. But if marital wobbles at the top matter, then this look through the mirror tells us something useful, something most of us can relate to. Score one for commitment. Score one for not backing away when problems mount. And so we step inside the walls of Windsor.

For intrusion, you see, has its uses.","In its latest bulletin from the frontiers of mental health research, the Daily Mail reports that Prince Charles seems to be, tragically, losing his tenuous hold on sanity, smashing china and losing his temper. ""So just what is wrong with the Prince of Wales,"" probed Richard Kay. Well, it's pretty obvious isn't it? He's gone mad. Or worse. ""Friends ... are increasingly concerned about his wellbeing."" Which sounds as if the prince has joined Les Dennis, Winona Ryder, Michael Barrymore and Jeffrey Archer, all of whom have been reported, at various times, to be on ""suicide watch"". If only it were so easy! In jail, where the term originated, suicidal inmates can be checked every hour or more, through a handy peephole. But distressed celebrities are scattered all over the place, often behind closed doors, and quite impossible for their carers in the press to keep tabs on. The safest solution, surely, would be for Lord Rothermere or one of his competitors to establish a sort of celebrity Bedlam adjacent to their newsrooms into which these tragic individuals could be committed for their own good. With the stars monitored 24 hours a day by staff reporters and media mental health experts such as Raj Persaud, we could rest assured that everything was being done to stand between our favourite celebrities and their besetting problems with depression and alcoholism, shop-lifting and overweight and - perhaps saddest of all - crockery."
1,"After the perils of Pauline, the triumphs of Trimble. And with yet another bound, our unlikely hero is free, until the next time. The peace process is saved: mainland Britain switches its attention over to England against Brazil: Peter Mandelson prepares to concentrate on the next election campaign. A crisis averted becomes inside page news for yesterday's papers. This is politics as usual, which disguises the fact that there is nothing usual about Northern Irish politics. What, for instance, would any normal party leader do if his deputy drifted off to Taiwan for the vital days of decision-forming? What would Blair do to Prescott? He would drop big John into oblivion from a great height, not greet him home and fete him as some mighty prophet. Yet John Taylor, preened with self-importance, is hailed merely because he agrees to support his boss.  You don't have to be loyal to be a loyalist. Jeffrey Donaldson and the rejectionists, playing to a bizarre audience of 860 grandees, won't give up. Paisley's DUP will probably stalk away from the reconvened assembly and rail outside the walls. Even without the IRA's dumps of mystic verbiage, words put beyond use where Cyril Ramaphosa keeps his dictionary, the scope for trouble remains almost infinite.  It is painfully easy, amid such confusion, just to recite the word ""process"" as some kind of mantra and to forget what it means. Pause,   though. What is this peace process? It is a formula for reconciliation and quiet on the streets. It puts London and Dublin in a settled context. It persuades once mortal enemies to sit side by side as ministerial colleagues, deciding about jobs and schools and hospitals. By this transference of power, too, it seeks to make Ulster politics real at last, freed from a time warp of rhetoric and opposition posturings: the most necessary devolution of the lot.  But here there are other connections. Real politics also means winning and losing elections. It means change to the pulse of democracy - the eventual boot for Blair, the rise of the pensioner's friend. It involves ebb and flow.  We know that already from the matching devolutions of the last three years. Alun Michael has ebbed for ever. Donald Dewar may soon be gone with the flow. If you give voters assemblies and executives to elect, the voters become sovereign. You may make it difficult for them by installing the drag anchors of proportional representation: Scotland and Wales have those. They're stuck, by design, with coalition administrations.  They, though, can change the weighting of those coalitions and the faces who front them. One fine day, there'll be a Scots Nat chief minister in Edinburgh. One predictable day, Labour will be cut out of the Cardiff action. The question for Belfast, the hole in the heart of this process, is where the reality of politics bites there.   Let's assume that the assembly is back in business, stronger than before because of the worsting of Donaldson and the guarantees of the IRA. Trimble and his other (useful) deputy, Seamus Mallon, resume work: Martin McGuinness is more interested in A level results than Armalite stocks.  That, crucially, is the first base camp of reconciliation. Everybody who stood for election and still wants to play has a guaranteed part of the action. Badmouthing the British government doesn't stop the leaks in school roofs or improve ambulance response times. The focus inevitably shifts to practical policies and their delivery. Who cares about the Battle of the Boyne when there are jobs wanted now?  Getting there: got that. You could tell, even from the first few weeks of assembly life, how power and accountability can alter perspectives. (It's the old Yasser Arafat test: make him responsible for clean tap water and electrical supplies and he is seen in a different light.) The practical politicisation of politicians is the underpinning of peace.  But how, thereafter, does Northern Ireland move on the next camp, to the stage   where leaking school roofs or job losses bring electoral retribution? The difficulty with the Good Friday agreement is that it doesn't know: it never envisages a Bad Saturday. Our old chum d'Hondt, with his mathematical system to share out the fruits of proportional representation, operates relentlessly.  The assembly, monitored by equality commissioners, has inclusion engraved on its founding statutes. If you're one of the chosen 108, you have a stake: you have to register as a nationalist or a unionist or something other and your vote matters, by parallel consent or weighted majority, in the choice of every committee, every chairman, every minister.   It seems an odd question to put, but where is the opposition in such a controlled, infinitely balanced arena? Answer: except for Paisley, stomping on the lawn outside, there won't be an opposition that matters. The big boys within the walls are yoked together for all Good Fridays.  We ought to be clear that that fix, however essential it currently seems, is also a terrible snare. It freezes the religious divides and histories in another time warp. It makes party labels the key to power and seals them in their own little boxes. It purposely delays the moment when the Unionists or Sinn Fein or the SDLP will look out from their own sectarian audiences and begin to match their policies to the orientations of London or of Dublin. In short, to practise the real politics   which can free Northern Ireland from its infernal cocoon.  I want to see Sinn Fein's policy bag emptied on to the floor for wider inspection so that I can see how its old collection of sub-Marxist nostrums is changing (just as the ANC in South Africa has changed). I want to hear about hospital waiting lists and bobbies on the beat. I want to see David Trimble and Gerry Adams locked in debate about gay rights. I want a relevance which doesn't end at the ferry terminal. I would even (ye gods!) love a good row over the euro.  The latest wobbly triumph of Trimble is a million miles from such mundane joys. It is still locked in its own, claustrophobic cage, still absorbed with the symbolism of flags and guns fallen silent but not destroyed: the whether, not the how. In mainland Britain, we have handed in all our guns, because that is the law. In Belfast, the legacy of Dunblane doesn't count. The debate remains wholly internalised.  Devolution, within the United Kingdom, means finding a different kind of balance. It means finding a matching political system that fits. It means the political ability to talk about the same things in the same tone of voice and to exact the same kind of electoral punishment in failure. That is the only real culmination of what we glibly call the ""peace process"".

A new rhythm and new beginning which one distant day may be called normality.  <BR>Peter Preston","We're losing the art of public interaction. The spaces - from a public park to a forum for public exchange - where social debate and contemplation can take place are eroding before our eyes. Two very disparate and under-reported initiatives were launched last week, both rooted in this concern - precursors perhaps of the beginning of civil society's fight back. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) delivered its manifesto for better public spaces, saying that a combination of powerful private interests, aggressive litigiousness and timidity by public authorities were together undermining public space.  Suffolk County Council's infamous decision to outlaw hanging baskets from some lampposts in Bury St Edmunds is the most graphic example of the general trend. Fear that the baskets might fall and hurt someone, sparking an expensive compensation claim, had forced the county council to act. Nor is it an idle fear. Manchester City Council's budget for compensation claims now exceeds its budget for repairing pavements - also, ironically, the source of many claims for compensation.  All around the country, according to Cabe, boating lakes, markets, adventure playgrounds, and public parks are under growing threat because they are deemed too risky in the face of claims for compensation from some aggrieved injured litigant or that they are too expensive to protect from the ambitions of private developers - and there is too little protest about the wider cost to us of access being reduced or even phased out altogether.  Yet there is a wealth of evidence that being able to stroll in a park and breathe good air prolongs life expectancy; that having somewhere to play reduces kids' obesity; that having wide pavements and well-lit bus stops reduces crime. It is worth paying to have park keepers, finding funds to pay compensation and imposing the planning controls to protect public space. Such things enhance our lives. By refusing to pay for our public sphere we collude in undermining it.  The Royal Society of Arts is worried that our well-being is under equal pressure from another source. We are losing the capacity to engage in anything other than private conversation about private passions; even public debate is increasingly about our private loves, hates and emotions - and when public debate is about something public, say the European constitution, or even the decline in public space, it is conducted in a way designed not to illuminate or inform.  There is certainly no dialogue; it is two sides duelling, holding their views with unshakeable and unchanging conviction, giving no quarter and spinning every fact with a vengeance, with the   public cast as onlookers to a gladiatorial spectacle. Their role is to enjoy the sparks rather than learn or modify their opinions in the light of the evidence.  The RSA's response is to launch a national series of coffee-house debates based on the coffee-house out of which it was born 250 years ago.  It wants to recreate the capacity to be engaged in public affairs, and that means, believes Britain's most venerable think-tank, that we need to acquire again the art of thinking aloud about public issues in an environment where you are not pounced on for making a mistake, not toeing the party line or excoriated for saying something illogical.  Creative conversation, when it happens, is intoxicating; interlocuters inspire and fire new thoughts in each other. Let us hope that we all know this sensation; but nobody would say good conversation characterises our current public realm. The Royal Society wants us to talk in today's coffee-houses - 500 Starbucks - and email them the results of our conversations.  I welcome both initiatives. We are locked in a vicious circle, in which declining public space begets the very excessive individualism that feeds self-interested litigiousness and the bear-baiting, take-no-prisoners attitude towards public debate.  What drives the compensation culture is the decline in people's sense of belonging to a wider public culture. This fuels a disproportionate sense of personal injury - along with the prospect of some easy money.  Equally, media interviews where the interviewer sets out to entrap and draw blood do nothing to enlarge public understanding - but that is because the listener and viewer collude in seeing the Minister, MP or official in the same way as the media. That is, not as legitimate representatives of a public realm that can only be sustained in the last resort if we respect it; rather, as somebody we want to see discomfited or commit a gaffe. Public life has become a kind of soap opera in which issues are less important than the private foibles, wobbles and passions of the actors in the drama.  Charles Kennedy's sweating or Michael Portillo's gay experiences are one part of this - the other is extraordinary over-exaggeration. There are 12 weeks to stop a European superstate; MMR vaccine causes autism; the Six Nations rugby tournament is bankrupt as a sports spectacle. Choose your issue and you know what I mean.  Even as I write this I'm aware of the counter arguments; the public parks I know well seem in rude good health. And if some toffs are complaining about the vulgarity and prurience of the British media, it was ever thus. The greater truth is its vitality - and people have the wit to see through the hype. Public debate is always going to be edgy with debaters probing for any advantage they can; to imagine it should be conducted as some glorified seminar is to bay for the moon.  And why shouldn't we be interested in the personal dimensions of our public figures?  And yet I stick to my guns. There is a rise in the compensation culture and there is a degradation in how public argument is conducted. What connects them both is a diminishing sense of why what we hold in common is as important to our well-being as the freedom to pursue our self-interest and accent only the personal. And this disappearing collectivity is, for example, why the BBC is under assault; it is why, in a larger sense, we are so bad-tempered and ill at ease with ourselves.  But the desire for better co-exists with the same trends. Thus Cabe and the RSA last week. Thus the polls that simultaneously show huge support for the BBC even while it is denigrated. Thus the periodic interest in the idea of new newspapers (the latest is Stephen Glover's the  World) which are built on public interest and impartial news journalism.  Such tensions are a feature of the age. The idea of 'the public' is too weak. It is only if we recognise that and fight back to restore its place that we have any hope of reasserting the values that are, literally, good for us all.  I am on the side of those who want to fight back."
1,"Your starter for 10, Herr von Ribbentrop...How, one fine day, will the house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (UK division) come to dust? How will our royals reach the end of their line? It's a perennial question for historians, politicians, spooks. The trouble is that the answer keeps changing. After 1936 - the closest shave so far - you'd have said that Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson could do the job double-handed. There was the British establishment, flat on its back. There (an enterprising Guardian investigation now reveals) was the FBI, sure that Wallis Simpson had become a Nazi spy, prone to whisper sweet somethings in Von Ribbentrop's ear. Treachery and sex, primed to explode. Could any republican have asked for more?  Yet, even then, even in that extremity, it didn't happen. Baldwin greased the slipway, Churchill wafted the dubious duo off to the Bahamas. J Edgar Hoover declined to leak his suspicions to the press. Had Hoover, as usual, got his plots in a twist? Probably, Mrs bin Simpson. The main thing about the duke and duchess wasn't their duplicity, but their invincible stupidity. They went off to Germany together to study ""low-cost housing"". They had tea with Hitler in Berchtesgaden. They joked with Goering about the map in his library which somehow didn't include Austria. ""Ho, ho,"" said the field-marshal, jowls shaking with mirth, ""I needed a new map, and since Austria will soon join Germany - voluntarily of course - it seemed more economical to anticipate the event."" And the duchess, in her own memoirs, wrote all of this rancid stuff down.  Never underestimate the dogged strength of royal stability pacts. They paper over every imbecility. They distract and move on. They give the institution of monarchy a resilience which stretches far beyond rationality.  No, the Windsors will not easily go this way. But, since all dynasties depart at some time, the question remains: how will they go? Here the winds of changing opinion blow.  There will not, as constitutional reformers such as Charter 88 once fondly believed, come a decisive moment when a government of the left decides to cleanse our body politic of its flummeries. The case for cleaning away the dung of deference is as strong as it ever was; but the force is not with it. You can publish pamphlets till kingdom come - but, in practice, the kingdom won't be moved.  Nor, frankly, will personality disorders of the kind which surrounded the death of Diana bring the monarchy down. We've seen what happens in the wake of such PR disasters: a new team of spin doctors is recruited, a new PR pitch smoothly developed. There's no natural close to such a recycling process. Pay the right man the right money and you can survive indefinitely.  In fact, it now emerges, the true threat to continuance lies elsewhere - in the vociferous advice of those who claim to be the royal family's greatest friends and defenders. Take, for instance, the Daily Mail, puffed with triumphalism after the Queen Mother's funeral and a golden party of a jubilee - and cheerfully duffing up this paper for trying to rain on such parades. Well, fair enough ... but then the Mail leads the charge against Princess Pushy and her £69-a-week Kensington Palace apartment. Pushy and Bushy, a new pair of royals on the make to revile. It's a scandal. MPs begin sounding off, the pressure grows.   This isn't a Guardian campaign, though. It's a Mail campaign. The damage, however, could hardly be greater. Love and affection for HM, as commodiously chronicled at the start of June, turns swiftly to carping about the greed and arrogance of her family. She who was strong after 50 years is made to seem weak again. But what is the charge here, what's the offence? Of family looking after family, of more fortunate and moneyed Windsors taking care of the weaker brothers and sisters? It seems a slightly bizarre crusade from the ultimate newspaper of self-help and family values.  The thesis, expounded a few days ago when the keeper of the privy purse - formerly of KPMG and not, praise heaven, Arthur Andersen - published his household accounts, is that you can keep the palace show on the road if you deliver good accounting value. Wine bills down from £135,000 to £97,000 year on year. (Out with the fine Bordeaux, in with South African merlot.) Helicopters down from £2m to £1.9m. Crockery and cutlery down from £16,000 to £11,000 - but stationery up from £14,000 to £22,000. And so on, in close detail. What you lose on the fire insurance premiums you try to make up on flowers, photocopying and second-class postage. Now, if they could only stop washing the sheets so often!  The headline calculation from this exercise - the figure that puts the squeeze on Pushy's £69 - is that keeping our royals in the manner accustomed costs every Joe Citizen 58p a year. Good value as long as you can keep selling surplus carriages and keep staff wages down by paying them in minor gongs rather than money.  But step back for a second and ask that bigger question again. If this is the kind of majesty we want, why not crown the comptroller and auditor general instead? The jubilee wasn't a success because we counted every sparkler; it was a success because we spent loads and loads of cash. Our monarchs don't travel EasyJet; they cost nearly £4m a year buzzing around.  Royal household wisdom. The Windsors are conspicuous consumers. That is their way and our way with them. Holding their contract cleaning bills up to the light won't save them - to the contrary. Down the pan and round the bend with Tesco's own label Harpic substitute? Salvation isn't value for money. Salvation is living and playing rich, salvation is looking down, not adding up - as even Mrs Simpson was bright enough the understand.","Nobody, of course, can go back to the beginning. That is an Irish legend lost among the bogs and mists of futility. But, as the chimera called ""peace"" slips and slides again, it is at least worth going back to the beginning of these Troubles (more modern than ancient). What did the British government think then? We know, because the 30-year rule opens the closed cabinet doors of 1969. Home secretary James Callaghan told his colleagues that: ""There is a good deal of corroboration for the view that the Catholics have acted in self-defence, and little evidence to support the view of the Northern Irish government that the IRA are mainly responsible."" Big Jim's officials reported widespread unionist gerrymandering, favouritism and seedy control over local authority housing. ""There are legitimate grievances and it is entirely legitimate that they should be ventilated by demonstration.""  Callaghan himself told the new Northern Irish prime minister that ""he must not rely on British military support in maintaining repressive policies"". Harold Wilson's private secretary reported bleakly that ""our main trouble is from the Protestants"". Defence secretary Healey blamed the RUC for the ""indiscriminate use of firearms, tear gas etc"" and the head of the British army described a police force ""which is behind the times, poorly led and administered, with a sadly inefficient special branch.""   In sum, as it seemed to the men and women gathered around the long table in Downing Street, this was a no-win game which the unionists, the triumphalists of the Orange Order, had started by their mindless choice of sectarian repression over liberal democracy. And now, yet again, the poor old mainland Brits were being summoned to sort things out in blood, sweat and tears.  You don't need to agree in detail with those ministers and witnesses of 30 years ago to see the point. Agreement about anything in Northern Ireland's past is probably an unattainable golal. But the cabinet minutes do paint a grisly picture of frustration and helpessness. They tell us, as troubled times returned, where an impotent government far away laid the (mostly private, teeth-grinding) blame. British imperialism? Wilson's team, even then, wished Belfast could be deemed independent and told to push off.  For once, too, the recent past has relevance to the present. It reminds us, as the IRA hangs on to its guns and another ""process"" of reconciliation threatens to go belly up - perhaps for many years - that it takes two to make a peace. It reminds us that nothing can really begin afresh without continuing compromise, exercised day after day until it becomes normality.  A few weeks ago one truce ended. Eta, the zealots of Basque nationalism, returned to blowing up cars in crowded streets and killing people. And some thing else returned to Spain, the squares of Madrid and Pamplona. Crowds a million-strong walked arm in arm, expressing their disgust, horror and defiance. The Spanish people made their voices heard and, in so doing, immediately isolated the tiny straggle of terrorists. It won't end their campaign, to be sure: but it does create a political context which puts the greatest pressure on them. The people, massed, have that power.  I wonder, though, where the people of Northern Ireland have gone through these few glum weeks of slithering failure. I wonder (extrapolating) what the rest of the people of Britain think, if they care. For it is the people who have gone missing again, ruled themselves out of this eqation.   They were there once, with their candlelit vigils and their funeral marches as the killings echoed on. Many gallant individuals began movements then and still persevere. But where is the great shout of anger? Where are streets filled end to end with crowds who put peace first? Where is the pressure, the blessed pressure, for change?   Gerry Adams was talking the other day about ""the undefeated army"" of the IRA. It wasn't a popular line, one promptly rubbished by all the usual suspects. But it is also a clinically accurate description. The IRA was not defeated, any more than the British army and the RUC were defeated. Neither side was winning or losing: the struggle was just going on, for decade after decade, without point or possible outcome. If it is now renewed, as it may well eventually be, the years ahead will only be filled with more pointless violence. The IRA cannot win; but nor - as those who confront them admit under their breath - can the security forces. There is no easy fix of internment. There is no possibility of totally isolating the terrorists where a sectarian divide still yawns. No solution: just more of the same. You might as well say the Russian army has settled the Chechen problem by flattening Grozny. Dream on!  So where are the people in their own hour of need? There is no doubt how they feel or what they want, passively. They continue, for the most part, to vote along traditional lines. They haven't transplanted the old heart of Northern Irish politics.  They have accepted the reluctances of the Aremy Council with resignation and more depressingly, done little to disrupt activist distrust of the unionist Council which now, apparently, will circumscribe David Trimble's room for manoeuvre still more chokingly. They have, in sum, left hope to others they   decline to influence directly. Too harsh? Certainly in individual terms (see the tortured exhaustion of Seamus Mallon) but a collective judgment remains more problematical. If both Councils now feel the wind of outrage at their backs, then anything yet remains possible. But if there is no such manifest fury, then that in itself will deliver an awful truth.  Exit Mo, enter Mandy; exit, one day, Tony, enter who-can-say? The heirs of Wilson and Callaghan over the water will keep toiling on, biting their lips, hiding their real feelings because words out of place invoke inevitable furies. But peace, real peace, has to be craved for on the ground, sought as the highest prize. Peace isn't about symbols - a few machine guns or tons of Semtex given up in a hollow show of ""disarmament"" in Kosovo mode. New guns can always be bought, new obstacles found among the fudged clauses of diplomacy. Peace is determination to live together come what may. Peace isn't a minefield of ifs and buts - and sitting back while the vested interests carry on conniving. Peace has to be worked for.  A million Spaniards realise that. They walk for a purpose. It is a bleak thing to say, but there will be no lasting peace for Ireland until more millions throng the streets of Belfast and Dublin (and yes, Manchester and Birmingham too). This, 30 years on with nothing to show, is our challenge and our responsibility. And one day we shall have to acknowledge that by taking the prize for ourselves."

Houses were boarded up to change voting patterns, false certificates were used to evade arms embargoes and palms were greased to help secure foreign contracts. Conservative corruption left such a broad tideline that it isn't easy to say where the highwater mark was. But many would choose a story which resulted in the most humiliating legal verdict any recent British government has faced: the Pergau dam scandal. The Tory administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Malaysia, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Aid and Trade Provision.  If, somehow, you managed to miss this drama, don't worry. The whole intriguing tale is now being repeated by a government near you. The Labour administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, has misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Turkey, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Export Credit Guarantee Department.  There is, however, one critical difference. The primary purpose of the Pergau dam, like that of most major construction, was to provide lucrative work for large companies. The Ilisu dam in Turkey will certainly fulfil this function. Like Pergau, it will also provide some electricity, though not, of course, as much as forecast. But the main purposes of the Turkish government's project are quite different. The first is to hold Syria and Iraq to ransom by controlling the flow of the river Tigris. The second is to assist its ethnic cleansing programme.  Hasankeyf, an ancient city, is one of the most important archaeological sites on earth; contin- uously inhabited for 10,000 years, it bears the remains of nine distinct civilisations. The Kurds regard the city as their cultural heartland. Turkey sees it as an emblem of resistance. When Hasankeyf and surrounding settlements are drowned by the dam, some 20,000 Kurds will be forced from their homes and moved into model villages in which they can be monitored and controlled. Our government, which went to war in the spring to stop ethnic cleansing, is, in the winter, underwriting it.  It is not hard to see why. European leaders have just agreed that Turkey can join the union: one result will be valuable contracts for British companies if the government   can forge strong commercial links with the Turkish administration. British companies see the country's defence sector as a massive potential market.  The Labour government's involvement in the Ilisu dam may be the biggest corruption scandal in western Europe, but you could be forgiven for having missed it. The decision was, it seems, to have been announced on Christmas Eve, but when the Hamilton verdict broke, the government seized its chance. The headline on the press release it distributed indicated only that Stephen Byers, the secretary of state for trade and industry, had released reports about the dam. Only halfway down the press release was notice given that Mr Byers was ""minded to grant"" the project government backing. A story which should have been at the top of the bulletins was either missed or excluded altogether. The Labour government, in other words, has successfully hidden its own corruption behind a tale of Tory sleaze.  The reports on which the   government's decision is supposed to have been based provide a compelling case for taking precisely the opposite course. They show that most local people object to the dam, that no provisions have been made for adequate compensation, that the project has been attended by an information black-out, that it threatens fish species found only in the Tigris, and could poison the water downstream. The ""consultation"" and ""informed consent"" the reports insist must take place before the project goes ahead are a sick joke in a region in which dissent is ruthlessly crushed and people are imprisoned and tortured simply for speaking their own language. As the Kurdish Human Rights Project has documented, 19 villages in the area due to be flooded have already been evicted at gunpoint and destroyed. Instead of insisting that human rights are respected and the environment is defended, the British government is relying on assurances from the Turkish authorities, which are about as dependable as Neil Hamilton's memory.  Silenced by Turkey's repression, the Kurds are a half- forgotten, disposable people. Our government has wrapped them up and handed them over to big business. Christmas presents seldom come so generous."
1,"London was once again a city of migrants yesterday. For the second time in two weeks, the capital's streets were filled not with the usual cars and buses but thick, snaking columns of people on the move.These refugees from the city did not march with wagons piled high or bundles on their back, but with suitcases on wheels and mobile phones in their hands - just as they had a fortnight ago. Told that the London Underground had been closed, they were setting off on the long march back home.""Oh no, not again,"" was the first thought to pass through Isabelle Hans's mind. A charity worker, she found herself barred from her office just around the corner from Warren Street tube, the building hidden behind the blue and white plastic ribbons of a police cordon - just as it had been on July 7.Initial word suggested a macabre rerun of that fateful day: four explosions, three trains and a bus, one blast for each point of the compass around the centre of London.The pattern looked identical, so Londoners repeated their own behaviour, as if weary veterans of this new form of urban warfare.They texted their friends and family; they picked up snippets of news from portable radios or the internet; they cut short their working day and left offices in mid-afternoon for a journey on foot which they knew could take several hours.Even if the ritual was a repeat, the mood seemed different. Much was made of the stoicism of Londoners on July 7, an unruffled calm exhibited even by those who narrowly escaped the attacks. Yesterday, by all accounts, was not like that.Witnesses at the Oval station and elsewhere said that once they heard the sound of an explosion, or breathed in the acrid smell of smoke, passengers fell rapidly into a collective panic.There were reports of desperate stampedes as people rushed to get off trains and out of stations.One man at Warren Street station showed the television cameras a pile of sandals and flip-flops he had collected - abandoned by their owners as they ""ran for their lives"".Caitlin Jackson, 22, was at Leicester Square station as it was being evacuated.""I never saw people move as fast as that in my life. Everybody was quiet, it was all silent. But they had that panicked look on their faces.""Perhaps on July 7 the sheer surprise of the attacks numbed Londoners' reactions. The memory of July 7, the fear that they were about to experience an equally lethal rerun, seems to have had the opposite effect yesterday.The atmosphere lifted a bit once word spread that there were no fatalities. There was little of that July 7 tremble in the voice yesterday.""It's more fascination than panic,"" said David Sanderson, a business analyst at the Abbey bank, who had headed out in the lunch hour only to be shut out of his place of work. He joined the crowd behind police lines at Warren Street, waiting and watching.He was on the normally thronging thoroughfare of Tottenham Court Road, now quiet, filled with pedestrians and the occasional fire engine or police car. In common with several roads in the capital, what is usually a traffic-filled artery had become little more than a wide pedestrian path.But once the panic subsided, it was not the stubborn resilience of London cliche that was revealed. Instead there was frustration, irritation and a glimpse of the one thing terrorists crave most: fear and a glum recognition that maybe life cannot go on as normal.Dean Seddon, 23, had made the salesman's journey to London from St Helens - against his wife's wishes. ""She was going mad with me for coming,"" he said. At Charing Cross station he had been faced with a ""wave of people, saying 'Run! Run!'"" And now he thought his wife was right. Pulling his trolley-suitcase, hoping he could somehow get back to Merseyside, he had resolved not to come back to the capital ""for a while"" at least.Heidi Ashton, 20, had her three-year-old son asleep in a pushchair and had made up her mind too. No more buses or tubes for her, and certainly not for her child. Ms Jackson had just got off the phone after speaking to her parents, back in her native Canada. They had told her that enough was enough; it was time to come home.""Personally, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety; I'm pissed off,"" said Martina Leeven, 35, an officer with the Changing Faces charity. That morning, she had asked herself whether it was really safe to travel on the Underground. She had decided not. Pointing at her orange trainers, she told how she had, for the first time, done the hour's walk from Bethnal Green instead. ""I'm wondering, is this my life now?""She felt angry, not so much at the politicians or even the terrorists, but at ""the state of the world"".Her colleague, Michelle Bativala, agreed. The revelation that one of the July 7 bombers had been a primary school teacher had shaken her badly. ""Before you were looking for someone fanatical,"" she said. ""Now it could be anyone.""Ms Leeven said she had not seen anyone rushed or panicked, but rather ""walking around with a question mark on their faces."" It seemed to describe London itself: not quaking - yet - nor deluged with fresh grief. But etched with a giant question mark, wondering what tomorrow might bring.","The flames turning the night sky orange, the stench of burning flesh - no wonder the talk in the countryside is of apocalypse. ""We are on the threshold of Armageddon,"" warns the National Farmers Union man in Devon, girding himself for another night of slaughter, another bonfire of the carcasses. It is, to be sure, a medieval image, those piles of animal corpses being put to the flame - the pictures in the papers looking more like tapestries than photographs. And the panic is real. Farmers, already reeling after BSE and falling food prices, fear this could be the final blow. The Samaritans are on standby.  The rest of the nation stands back, heeding the warnings to keep its distance. To urban folk, this whole scene looks like one of those 1950s sci-fi tales - Quatermass or Day of the Triffids. Sealed-off farms, a deadly virus, government warnings to stay away: all that's needed now is for the army to move in. But townies have two other reactions to the foot and mouth epidemic sweeping Britain - reactions which could be as decisive for the farmers' fate as the virus itself. Neither will bring much comfort.  The first is confusion. Amid all the talk of European export bans, cancelled rugby matches and delayed general elections, plenty of people are still stuck on rather more basic questions. Like: what the hell is it? And: how might it affect me?  I've heard people shouting at the radio and TV, demanding answers to those questions. BSE they could understand: they knew cows went mad, visibly stumbling and slobbering in TV footage played over and over again, and that humans could contract a terrifying and lethal version of the disease.  Foot and mouth sounds so much simpler than bovine spongiform encephalopathy but my guess is that most non-rural folk remain baffled as to what it is. From the tone of the media coverage, and the end-of-the-world warnings from farmers, most Britons probably reckon F&amp;M is a killer disease which, once it touches a herd, rapidly wipes out the lot. As for humans, it's surely a death sentence to eat meat infected with the bug: your foot probably falls off and your mouth seizes up forever. Why else would government rules insist that infected animals be slaughtered instantly and the disease be eradicated so absolutely? It must be a merciless plague.  Not quite. If human beings eat meat infected with F&amp;M, they do not die; at most they might get the odd cold sore. As for animals, foot and mouth rarely kills them either. Some of the herd's sick or young are vulnerable, but for most a bout of F&amp;M means little more than blisters around the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves, an occasional spot of   lameness and a loss of appetite. The animal soon recovers and the whole thing lasts no more than two to three weeks.  So why all the fuss? The clue is in that last symptom: loss of appetite. For a sheep with F&amp;M stops gaining weight, an infected cow produces less milk. The animal does not suffer or die - it just becomes less productive, yielding a less juicy lamb chop or fewer pints of milk. In an industry that has become ultra-intensive - squeezing every last drop of value from a sheep, pig or cow - even this slight loss of productivity can make the difference between profit and loss. Put simply, foot and mouth is an economic disease.  A less-intensive brand of farming might take the old 19th-century attitude to F &amp;M: let it run. Back then, says agricultural historian Abigail Woods, who writes on the topic in today's Society section, ""no one took any notice of it at all, no one batted an eye-lid."" Today's consumers wouldn't notice the difference either.  But farmers can't just let foot and mouth come in, do its worst and blow away - even if that would be the most rational response. Foreign markets won't tolerate infected meat even if we would: the farmers' export trade would collapse. The law demands an extreme response too. A long outdated insistence that British meat be absolutely disease-free has led to the slaughter-on-sight policy, even when it is the emergency measures, not the virus itself, which really threatens farmers' livelihoods. The cure is worse than the disease.  Still, don't expect too much sympathy from the rest of us. For if this outbreak has triggered our incomprehension of modern farming, it has also exposed our indifference to its plight. Typical of the urban mood was Ken Livingstone's instant response, calling on the Countryside Alliance to cancel its planned march on London. With an unerring instinct for popular feeling, the mayor guessed at most Londoners' attitude to the farmers: keep out, and take your mucky boots and strange germs with you. The Alliance duly called the event off.  It's not hard to explain this urban chilliness toward the countryside. BSE was a turning point, breaking forever the cosy Farmer Giles myth of yore: suddenly Britons saw farms as giant agri-businesses, animal factories with profit the only motive. Never mind that many farmers didn't realise they were turning their livestock into cannibals: the trust was broken.  The countryside's war on the Labour government has not helped. Not because they don't have a good case: the depletion of rural bus services and post offices is real. What turns townies off is that country folk never marched on London about any of  those concerns: it was only when Labour moved against foxhunting that the countryside got organised. If the Alliance had been formed to save village schools, rather than the right to kill foxes, perhaps they would have enjoyed wider sympathy.  There's one more cause of the town's cold shoulder to the country and it's an irony. For it was Conservative governments - the farmers' party - who per suaded Britons that if an industry is uneconomic, then it must go, even if that destroys communities and their way of life. Pit villages made that plea in the 1980s but no one listened - least of all the farmers who kept voting Tory. Yet now they insist that Britain must subsidise their industry, even if we could import their product more cheaply from abroad. If that logic couldn't save the miners, why should it save them?  The farmers will argue that food is a special case. Britons, they reckon, remember the war - where we had to feed ourselves to stay alive. But few hold to that logic anymore: that's why Thatcherism didn't mind savaging our steel industry, even though we might need that one day to arm ourselves. No, it's a globalised world now; Britons won't mind filling their shopping trolleys from abroad. They do so already.   That sounds harsh and it is. It also lets us off the hook too easily. For if farmers have been driven to ever more intensive methods, it's partly to satisfy our demand for cheap food. As the novelist Jonathan Coe, whose What a Carve Up! skewered the food industry in the mid-90s, told me yesterday, ""absolute consumer choice"" comes at a terrible price - and it is the farmers now facing ruin who seem set to pay it.  So Frederick Forsyth can hint darkly in the Daily Mail that the foot and mouth virus was introduced deliberately, as a Labour plot against the countryside. But most Britons know better. They know that if farmers are reaping a bitter harvest now, they - and we - sowed much of it ourselves."
0,"London was once again a city of migrants yesterday. For the second time in two weeks, the capital's streets were filled not with the usual cars and buses but thick, snaking columns of people on the move.These refugees from the city did not march with wagons piled high or bundles on their back, but with suitcases on wheels and mobile phones in their hands - just as they had a fortnight ago. Told that the London Underground had been closed, they were setting off on the long march back home.""Oh no, not again,"" was the first thought to pass through Isabelle Hans's mind. A charity worker, she found herself barred from her office just around the corner from Warren Street tube, the building hidden behind the blue and white plastic ribbons of a police cordon - just as it had been on July 7.Initial word suggested a macabre rerun of that fateful day: four explosions, three trains and a bus, one blast for each point of the compass around the centre of London.The pattern looked identical, so Londoners repeated their own behaviour, as if weary veterans of this new form of urban warfare.They texted their friends and family; they picked up snippets of news from portable radios or the internet; they cut short their working day and left offices in mid-afternoon for a journey on foot which they knew could take several hours.Even if the ritual was a repeat, the mood seemed different. Much was made of the stoicism of Londoners on July 7, an unruffled calm exhibited even by those who narrowly escaped the attacks. Yesterday, by all accounts, was not like that.Witnesses at the Oval station and elsewhere said that once they heard the sound of an explosion, or breathed in the acrid smell of smoke, passengers fell rapidly into a collective panic.There were reports of desperate stampedes as people rushed to get off trains and out of stations.One man at Warren Street station showed the television cameras a pile of sandals and flip-flops he had collected - abandoned by their owners as they ""ran for their lives"".Caitlin Jackson, 22, was at Leicester Square station as it was being evacuated.""I never saw people move as fast as that in my life. Everybody was quiet, it was all silent. But they had that panicked look on their faces.""Perhaps on July 7 the sheer surprise of the attacks numbed Londoners' reactions. The memory of July 7, the fear that they were about to experience an equally lethal rerun, seems to have had the opposite effect yesterday.The atmosphere lifted a bit once word spread that there were no fatalities. There was little of that July 7 tremble in the voice yesterday.""It's more fascination than panic,"" said David Sanderson, a business analyst at the Abbey bank, who had headed out in the lunch hour only to be shut out of his place of work. He joined the crowd behind police lines at Warren Street, waiting and watching.He was on the normally thronging thoroughfare of Tottenham Court Road, now quiet, filled with pedestrians and the occasional fire engine or police car. In common with several roads in the capital, what is usually a traffic-filled artery had become little more than a wide pedestrian path.But once the panic subsided, it was not the stubborn resilience of London cliche that was revealed. Instead there was frustration, irritation and a glimpse of the one thing terrorists crave most: fear and a glum recognition that maybe life cannot go on as normal.Dean Seddon, 23, had made the salesman's journey to London from St Helens - against his wife's wishes. ""She was going mad with me for coming,"" he said. At Charing Cross station he had been faced with a ""wave of people, saying 'Run! Run!'"" And now he thought his wife was right. Pulling his trolley-suitcase, hoping he could somehow get back to Merseyside, he had resolved not to come back to the capital ""for a while"" at least.Heidi Ashton, 20, had her three-year-old son asleep in a pushchair and had made up her mind too. No more buses or tubes for her, and certainly not for her child. Ms Jackson had just got off the phone after speaking to her parents, back in her native Canada. They had told her that enough was enough; it was time to come home.""Personally, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety; I'm pissed off,"" said Martina Leeven, 35, an officer with the Changing Faces charity. That morning, she had asked herself whether it was really safe to travel on the Underground. She had decided not. Pointing at her orange trainers, she told how she had, for the first time, done the hour's walk from Bethnal Green instead. ""I'm wondering, is this my life now?""She felt angry, not so much at the politicians or even the terrorists, but at ""the state of the world"".Her colleague, Michelle Bativala, agreed. The revelation that one of the July 7 bombers had been a primary school teacher had shaken her badly. ""Before you were looking for someone fanatical,"" she said. ""Now it could be anyone.""Ms Leeven said she had not seen anyone rushed or panicked, but rather ""walking around with a question mark on their faces."" It seemed to describe London itself: not quaking - yet - nor deluged with fresh grief. But etched with a giant question mark, wondering what tomorrow might bring.","Injudicious as Neil Hamilton's misdemeanors were, they were only the flotsam on the tide of Tory sleaze. Houses were boarded up to change voting patterns, false certificates were used to evade arms embargoes and palms were greased to help secure foreign contracts. Conservative corruption left such a broad tideline that it isn't easy to say where the highwater mark was. But many would choose a story which resulted in the most humiliating legal verdict any recent British government has faced: the Pergau dam scandal. The Tory administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Malaysia, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Aid and Trade Provision.  If, somehow, you managed to miss this drama, don't worry. The whole intriguing tale is now being repeated by a government near you. The Labour administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, has misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Turkey, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Export Credit Guarantee Department.  There is, however, one critical difference. The primary purpose of the Pergau dam, like that of most major construction, was to provide lucrative work for large companies. The Ilisu dam in Turkey will certainly fulfil this function. Like Pergau, it will also provide some electricity, though not, of course, as much as forecast. But the main purposes of the Turkish government's project are quite different. The first is to hold Syria and Iraq to ransom by controlling the flow of the river Tigris. The second is to assist its ethnic cleansing programme.  Hasankeyf, an ancient city, is one of the most important archaeological sites on earth; contin- uously inhabited for 10,000 years, it bears the remains of nine distinct civilisations. The Kurds regard the city as their cultural heartland. Turkey sees it as an emblem of resistance. When Hasankeyf and surrounding settlements are drowned by the dam, some 20,000 Kurds will be forced from their homes and moved into model villages in which they can be monitored and controlled. Our government, which went to war in the spring to stop ethnic cleansing, is, in the winter, underwriting it.  It is not hard to see why. European leaders have just agreed that Turkey can join the union: one result will be valuable contracts for British companies if the government   can forge strong commercial links with the Turkish administration. British companies see the country's defence sector as a massive potential market.  The Labour government's involvement in the Ilisu dam may be the biggest corruption scandal in western Europe, but you could be forgiven for having missed it. The decision was, it seems, to have been announced on Christmas Eve, but when the Hamilton verdict broke, the government seized its chance. The headline on the press release it distributed indicated only that Stephen Byers, the secretary of state for trade and industry, had released reports about the dam. Only halfway down the press release was notice given that Mr Byers was ""minded to grant"" the project government backing. A story which should have been at the top of the bulletins was either missed or excluded altogether. The Labour government, in other words, has successfully hidden its own corruption behind a tale of Tory sleaze.  The reports on which the   government's decision is supposed to have been based provide a compelling case for taking precisely the opposite course. They show that most local people object to the dam, that no provisions have been made for adequate compensation, that the project has been attended by an information black-out, that it threatens fish species found only in the Tigris, and could poison the water downstream. The ""consultation"" and ""informed consent"" the reports insist must take place before the project goes ahead are a sick joke in a region in which dissent is ruthlessly crushed and people are imprisoned and tortured simply for speaking their own language. As the Kurdish Human Rights Project has documented, 19 villages in the area due to be flooded have already been evicted at gunpoint and destroyed. Instead of insisting that human rights are respected and the environment is defended, the British government is relying on assurances from the Turkish authorities, which are about as dependable as Neil Hamilton's memory.  Silenced by Turkey's repression, the Kurds are a half- forgotten, disposable people. Our government has wrapped them up and handed them over to big business. Christmas presents seldom come so generous."
1,"The flames turning the night sky orange, the stench of burning flesh - no wonder the talk in the countryside is of apocalypse. ""We are on the threshold of Armageddon,"" warns the National Farmers Union man in Devon, girding himself for another night of slaughter, another bonfire of the carcasses. It is, to be sure, a medieval image, those piles of animal corpses being put to the flame - the pictures in the papers looking more like tapestries than photographs. And the panic is real. Farmers, already reeling after BSE and falling food prices, fear this could be the final blow. The Samaritans are on standby.  The rest of the nation stands back, heeding the warnings to keep its distance. To urban folk, this whole scene looks like one of those 1950s sci-fi tales - Quatermass or Day of the Triffids. Sealed-off farms, a deadly virus, government warnings to stay away: all that's needed now is for the army to move in. But townies have two other reactions to the foot and mouth epidemic sweeping Britain - reactions which could be as decisive for the farmers' fate as the virus itself. Neither will bring much comfort.  The first is confusion. Amid all the talk of European export bans, cancelled rugby matches and delayed general elections, plenty of people are still stuck on rather more basic questions. Like: what the hell is it? And: how might it affect me?  I've heard people shouting at the radio and TV, demanding answers to those questions. BSE they could understand: they knew cows went mad, visibly stumbling and slobbering in TV footage played over and over again, and that humans could contract a terrifying and lethal version of the disease.  Foot and mouth sounds so much simpler than bovine spongiform encephalopathy but my guess is that most non-rural folk remain baffled as to what it is. From the tone of the media coverage, and the end-of-the-world warnings from farmers, most Britons probably reckon F&amp;M is a killer disease which, once it touches a herd, rapidly wipes out the lot. As for humans, it's surely a death sentence to eat meat infected with the bug: your foot probably falls off and your mouth seizes up forever. Why else would government rules insist that infected animals be slaughtered instantly and the disease be eradicated so absolutely? It must be a merciless plague.  Not quite. If human beings eat meat infected with F&amp;M, they do not die; at most they might get the odd cold sore. As for animals, foot and mouth rarely kills them either. Some of the herd's sick or young are vulnerable, but for most a bout of F&amp;M means little more than blisters around the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves, an occasional spot of   lameness and a loss of appetite. The animal soon recovers and the whole thing lasts no more than two to three weeks.  So why all the fuss? The clue is in that last symptom: loss of appetite. For a sheep with F&amp;M stops gaining weight, an infected cow produces less milk. The animal does not suffer or die - it just becomes less productive, yielding a less juicy lamb chop or fewer pints of milk. In an industry that has become ultra-intensive - squeezing every last drop of value from a sheep, pig or cow - even this slight loss of productivity can make the difference between profit and loss. Put simply, foot and mouth is an economic disease.  A less-intensive brand of farming might take the old 19th-century attitude to F &amp;M: let it run. Back then, says agricultural historian Abigail Woods, who writes on the topic in today's Society section, ""no one took any notice of it at all, no one batted an eye-lid."" Today's consumers wouldn't notice the difference either.  But farmers can't just let foot and mouth come in, do its worst and blow away - even if that would be the most rational response. Foreign markets won't tolerate infected meat even if we would: the farmers' export trade would collapse. The law demands an extreme response too. A long outdated insistence that British meat be absolutely disease-free has led to the slaughter-on-sight policy, even when it is the emergency measures, not the virus itself, which really threatens farmers' livelihoods. The cure is worse than the disease.  Still, don't expect too much sympathy from the rest of us. For if this outbreak has triggered our incomprehension of modern farming, it has also exposed our indifference to its plight. Typical of the urban mood was Ken Livingstone's instant response, calling on the Countryside Alliance to cancel its planned march on London. With an unerring instinct for popular feeling, the mayor guessed at most Londoners' attitude to the farmers: keep out, and take your mucky boots and strange germs with you.

They know that if farmers are reaping a bitter harvest now, they - and we - sowed much of it ourselves.","The list of victims is long. At the head of it should be the nearly 3m animals slaughtered and burned, along with the 68,000 cows, sheep and pigs set to follow them on to the funeral pyres. Next on the list would be the clutch of farmers who, despite £125m already pledged in compensation, will be driven out of business by an epidemic that swept through their land as devastating as a tornado. After them, the hoteliers and restaurateurs who saw their livelihoods dry up as the world's travellers declared Britain a medievally benighted no-go area. Who else might we list as victims of the great foot and mouth crisis of 2001, now said to be in its endgame? We probably should add the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which seems set for a post-election cull of its own: the death sentence may even be declared in today's Labour manifesto. Along with Maff, place its hapless minister, Nick Brown. He, too, looks set for the chopping block - though that will not be announced by Tony Blair in Birmingham today.  The victims are many and we will hear their stories for years to come. More reluctant to come forward may be those who want to bury this episode along with the animal carcasses. They are the culprits.  For any examination of this extraordinary saga - which paralysed a nation and suspended democracy for the only time in our peacetime history - reveals a complete systemic failure. Not one group or institution involved emerges with any credit; they all failed in their most basic duty. Long after the last pyre has stopped burning, foot and mouth will stand as an indictment of British public life - and of the very way we govern ourselves.  Since no institution is immune, let's start with my own. The media failed from the outset, by never explaining the most basic facts of this disease. When I wrote in February that foot and mouth was not a killer, but amounted to flu for animals and, at worst, a cold-sore for human beings, I was inundated with shocked responses from readers who had watched TV, read the papers and listened to the radio - but had never once been told the symptoms of a condition instantly branded a national emergency. For weeks the media aired terrifying pictures and wore long faces but refused to perform its fundamental task: stating the facts.  Next we should target government, at every level. Maff did almost everything wrong. Civil servants succumbed to that perennial bureaucratic habit: instead of thinking, they reached for the files. They saw that the past response to foot and mouth had always been to shut down the countryside and impose a blanket policy of slaughter. That was how it had been in 1967, so that's how it would be in 2001. Even the ""no entry"" signs Maff produced were printed in retro, postwar type: emblems of a dumb obedience to the past script and a failure to think anew.  Ministers were no better. Nick Brown did not demand a strategic overview from his department; he simply went for crisis control. He obeyed his civil servants, followed precedent and ordered mass slaughter. But even that he did not do properly, failing to move quickly enough, allowing crucial time to elapse between spotting the disease and killing infected animals. If he had just talked to a few agricultural historians, he would have heard how a 1920s outbreak spread chiefly because of the delay from report to slaughter. But he never learned that lesson.  Still, the buck hardly stops with him. The biggest cock-ups occurred far above his pay grade. The army was called in too late; there was complete indecision on the countryside - first visitors were told to keep out, then urged to come back in - and constant vacillation on vaccination, with talks, consultations and delays but no resolution. All these failures belong not to Nick Brown, but Tony Blair.  As a prime minister who declared himself in personal charge of this crisis, it fell to him to enlist the MoD or to make a firm decision on vaccination. That he did neither dents his constant boasts of competence: on foot and mouth he dithered as badly as John Major ever did.  These are, however, minor charges on the PM's rap sheet. His greatest failure was one of leadership. He should have been able to do what Maff and Brown did not - to see the big picture. He should have asked why the policy of slaughter existed in the first place, rather than blindly following it. He would have been told the aim was to eradicate foot and mouth as quickly as possible so that Britain could soon regain its disease-free status.  If he'd wondered why that mattered, he would have been told it was essential for Britain's meat export industry. ""How much is that worth?"" he might have asked, only to be told, on Maff's own figures, that the total amounted to £592m. He could then have compared that sum to the £64bn generated by British tourism, and worked out whether it was worth jeopardising that - by showing the world TV pictures of Britain in flames - for the sake of selling lamb, pork and beef abroad.  In other words, a genuine act of leadership would have been to bin Maff's outdated files and think about the British economy that exists today. He could have stopped the slaughter, opting for limited vaccination instead - saving billions of pounds and millions of animals.  He did not, because that would have risked antagonising the farming lobby - next in line in the great foot and mouth rollcall of shame. Their weepy protests for their slaughtered herds, even as they refused a vaccination policy that might have saved animal lives, exposed the farming lobby for what it is: defenders of an economic interest. It was their short-sighted, profit-seeking pursuit of the export trade that drove the insane slaughter policy. As the veterinary historian Abigail Woods puts it: ""The economic interest of a small section of the farming community seems to have governed the country.""  The prosecution is not finished yet. The animal welfare movement was missing in action throughout the whole ordeal. Their only presence came in the form of RSPCA inspectors, cheerfully on hand during the mass culls. They did not raise their voices in protest; they did not attempt the blockades they once mounted to stop live exports of veal calves or the demos they stage outside laboratories involved in animal experimentation. They stayed silent, perhaps believing that such creatures were doomed through intensive farming anyway, and that a funeral pyre was no worse than an abattoir. Maybe, says Woods, ""they would rather save a single fox than a couple of million cattle"".  Their record is appalling, along with everyone else connected with this sorry story. We need a serious, probing public inquiry to lay bare what really happened. For a kind of collective madness descended on these islands - and we were all infected by it."

The fall in the birth rate across the West is testimony to a growing pessimism about the future; the menaces that together seem to make the good life unattainable range from fear that science is running amok to terrorism and climate change. Live for today and don't have children is a rallying cry finding more adherents.The world is not a pleasant place and seems to be getting less pleasant fast. Above all else, we seem powerless to control and shape these forces; they exist as ominous influences that can no longer be contained.In this sense, the very idea of progress is now contested. No contemporary historians would trace British history, Macaulay-like, as an account of how democracy, the rule of law and the extension of British values have steadily increased their influence. We have no Sidney and Beatrice Webb dedicated to the possibility of social improvement. We have no Nye Bevan who can convince us that political action can shape the world.There is no Keynes to guide our economic thinking. There are no inventors or scientists so celebrated that when they die, London's streets would throng with mourners, as they did for Brunel and Stephenson in the nineteenth century.  Instead, there is a rise in credulity accompanied by an insistence that we must not meddle with natural verities. Religious fundamentalism, in the Christian and Islamic worlds alike, insists that religious texts should be interpreted literally. Christian creationists, arguing that God and not natural selection created the world, find a market as ready for their views as their counterparts in Islam.There is a small industry attacking the very idea of scientific method; for it, there is no objective material reality and the search to discover, explain and master the natural world has reached the ethical and moral limits. From now on, warn writers such as Francis Fukuyama, science is taking us into territory where it sets up men as gods able to manipulate the very marrow of humanity.This veneration of nature and suspicion of human agency makes conservatives of Right and Left alike. Political activism, even when allegedly radical, is imbued with a conservative streak. What is held out as the desirable norm is some Elysian state of nature in which there are no GM crops, only sustainable energy use, science is caged and communities are self-sustaining, trading as little as possible with the outside world. Prince Charles and the Greens make common purpose.This seeps into how we feel about social experimentation generally. New ways of teaching, of parenting, of living with other races are frowned on. We must stick to natural rules. David Goodhart, a liberal intellectual, wins an astonishing number of column inches arguing that as we prefer to associate with our own, there is a necessary and inevitable trade-off between solidarity and diversity.When the Left criticises Blair and New Labour for their lack of radicalism and their caution, it rarely places the criticism in this wider context. A progressive party can't flourish in an environment where the currents feeding progressivism are in retreat. The character of politics has a symbiotic relationship with the society of which it is part. If the cultural, intellectual and social forces that underpin progressive politics are themselves challenged, even the most inspired political leadership will only change matters at the margin. It's a fair complaint that New Labour attempts that only fitfully, but let's put the complaint into context.Blair and Brown are more conscious of this missing component of the progressive project than most commentators concede and Brown, particularly, thinks deeply about how to resurrect some confidence in the idea of progress. Which is why his breakfast meeting last week with 30 leaders of Britain's scientific community was of more importance than just to British science. Brown, and Blair for that matter, not only see British scientists as a core part of the New Labour progressive coalition, they see a revival of science and recovery of its self-belief as a handmaiden for advancing the economy and the idea of progress.Brown committed to a 10-year build up of investment in Britain's science infrastructure which will be the centrepiece of this summer's comprehensive spending review. He wants the share of GDP devoted to scientific research to rise towards the top of the international league table. He wants more collaboration between universities and business; more scientists and more science taught in schools, reversing the alarming decline in scientific GCSE and A-levels over the last 15 years.Moreover, the Government is prepared to take risks to make researchers feel that Britain is science-friendly; it countenances stem-cell research, wants to agree wider trials with GM food and will have no truck with the anti-vivisection movement. More investment is being accompanied by a cultural commitment to science; here, the Government shows a leadership that eludes it over Europe and the euro or the case for higher taxation.Which is all to the good, but I fear it underestimates the scale of the task. In the nineteenth century and for a good part of the twentieth, science was underpinned by a widespread understanding that it underwrote progress and prosperity alike. The shrinking of Britain's manufacturing base means that the number of sizable science-based companies hardly extends beyond aerospace and pharmaceuticals.  Today's prosperity is built on a credit-backed consumer boom and a service-sector economy that push forward independently of the state of science. In the US, some of the most dynamic parts of the country are the new 'ideopolises', where science-based universities spearhead the growth of new industries; apart from Cambridge, there are no British ideopolises, although Manchester has ambitions.But we need not just companies and parts of Britain which we can hold up as exemplars of the prosperity science can bring. We need a wider cultural acceptance that where science is currently taking us - understanding the building blocks on which life is constructed - is not terrifying but exhilarating.While scientific method does work to push back the frontiers of knowledge, it is also true that we need ever more robust mechanisms to discuss its implications and ensure that the benefits are universally shared and ethical risks universally guarded against.Science, paradoxically, has always flowered best when society has a strong public realm which allows it to have confidence that science ultimately can be made to serve us rather than be used against us - the fear of those who want to ban stem-cell research, cloning and GM foods.  Today's public realm is shrivelled and under siege; it, too, needs to be shored up. To revive the idea of progress is to revive the public realm that allows us to shape the world, rather than be shaped by it. New Labour is undertaking a proper fight, but it needs to think much bigger if it wants to win it."
1,"William Hague had a dose of it yesterday, just as Tony Blair had before him. Neither of them would have been surprised: after all, it has become the quasi-divine right of party leaders to be swamped in the ovations and adulations of their party conference. But one man will have no such luck. David Trimble will not be forced to adopt a pose of shy modesty, halting the rolling applause of delegates when he faces the Ulster Unionist conference tomorrow. On the contrary, he will face an audience at least half of which is plotting his downfall - scheduled for a special meeting of the party's ruling council at the end of the month. The plotters are the likes of William Thompson, one of Trimble's MPs who yesterday offered this comradely assessment of his leader's position: ""He is on the skids and cannot survive.""  Thompson and friends want Trimble to pull out of Northern Ireland's fledgling administration, thereby collapsing the institution. As the secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, warned yesterday, that's a fast track to putting 1998's Good Friday agreement in the deep freeze if not the morgue. The plotters' motives are a mix of conviction - they reckon the agreement has brought unionists too little and republicans too much - and self-interest: after the hardliners of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists snatched the UUP stronghold of South Antrim in a byelection last month, they fear for their own political skins.  So Trimble has no shortage of reasons for walking away from the peace process: he wants to keep his job. Nor would he lack arguments. He could say the South Antrim result shows his community has lost faith in the accord. He could point to the early release of terrorist prisoners and the proposed name change of the Royal Ulster Constabulary as proof of how much unionists have been asked to give - and the lack of progress on decommissioning as proof of how little they have won in return. He could cite the loyalist civil war and yesterday's bomb alert on the Belfast-Dublin railway line, almost certainly the work of dissident republicans, as evidence that the peace process has brought plenty of process - but all too little peace.   For all that, he should not walk away from the peace table. First, he should remember that, when the unionist people had a chance to vote on the Good Friday agreement, they voted yes. That moral mandate remains - and with it a moral obligation not to destroy the accord. Only a no vote in a new referendum can remove that duty.  Second, he has a powerful response to those who say the agreement has brought unionists nothing. Trimble   can boast - indeed should have spent two years boasting - that, thanks to the deal he negotiated, unionists have won enormous gains. For the first time, republicanism has accepted the partition of Ireland, confirmed by Sinn Fein's presence in the Belfast executive and assembly. What's more the Irish Republic has given up its historic claim to the north, rewording its constitution accordingly. No unionist leader ever won such a prize before.  But if these advances seem abstract, Trimble should ask unionists to look around. Yes, there is still violence - from the fratricidal feuding on the Shankill Road to the enduring menace of the Real IRA - but the once all-pervasive threat from the provisionals has been quieted. The IRA has made as clear as it can its resignation from warfare, opening up its once top-secret arsenals to outside inspection - unimaginable a decade ago. More concrete still, unionists can see the change the peace process has made - with foreign investment flowing in and business at last allowed to flourish.  If none of that prevails,   Trimble should ask the nay-sayers what they would do in his place. Do they really think that ending self-rule in Northern Ireland would make decommissioning more likely - that if unionists say no, then republicans will say yes? What logic is it that makes the rejectionists believe they can refuse every compromise - keep the RUC as it is and share no power with nationalists -yet still expect the other side to keep giving? Mandelson is right: unless both sides give and take, there can be no accord.  That means nationalist flexibility on policing and republican movement on decommissioning, but it also requires a reciprocal approach from unionism. For peace processes have their own dynamic: if one side refuses to budge then the other does, too. The result is not always a return to the status quo ante, but something worse - a lurch back into all-out confrontation. If they doubt it, unionists need only look at that other stalled peace process -now spilling blood in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.  Those seeking the removal of David Trimble, unionism's most accomplished peacemaker, should think on that. The absence of peace is not a vacuum - it is war.","The list of victims is long. At the head of it should be the nearly 3m animals slaughtered and burned, along with the 68,000 cows, sheep and pigs set to follow them on to the funeral pyres. Next on the list would be the clutch of farmers who, despite £125m already pledged in compensation, will be driven out of business by an epidemic that swept through their land as devastating as a tornado. After them, the hoteliers and restaurateurs who saw their livelihoods dry up as the world's travellers declared Britain a medievally benighted no-go area. Who else might we list as victims of the great foot and mouth crisis of 2001, now said to be in its endgame? We probably should add the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which seems set for a post-election cull of its own: the death sentence may even be declared in today's Labour manifesto. Along with Maff, place its hapless minister, Nick Brown. He, too, looks set for the chopping block - though that will not be announced by Tony Blair in Birmingham today.  The victims are many and we will hear their stories for years to come. More reluctant to come forward may be those who want to bury this episode along with the animal carcasses. They are the culprits.  For any examination of this extraordinary saga - which paralysed a nation and suspended democracy for the only time in our peacetime history - reveals a complete systemic failure. Not one group or institution involved emerges with any credit; they all failed in their most basic duty. Long after the last pyre has stopped burning, foot and mouth will stand as an indictment of British public life - and of the very way we govern ourselves.  Since no institution is immune, let's start with my own. The media failed from the outset, by never explaining the most basic facts of this disease. When I wrote in February that foot and mouth was not a killer, but amounted to flu for animals and, at worst, a cold-sore for human beings, I was inundated with shocked responses from readers who had watched TV, read the papers and listened to the radio - but had never once been told the symptoms of a condition instantly branded a national emergency. For weeks the media aired terrifying pictures and wore long faces but refused to perform its fundamental task: stating the facts.  Next we should target government, at every level. Maff did almost everything wrong. Civil servants succumbed to that perennial bureaucratic habit: instead of thinking, they reached for the files. They saw that the past response to foot and mouth had always been to shut down the countryside and impose a blanket policy of slaughter. That was how it had been in 1967, so that's how it would be in 2001. Even the ""no entry"" signs Maff produced were printed in retro, postwar type: emblems of a dumb obedience to the past script and a failure to think anew.  Ministers were no better. Nick Brown did not demand a strategic overview from his department; he simply went for crisis control. He obeyed his civil servants, followed precedent and ordered mass slaughter. But even that he did not do properly, failing to move quickly enough, allowing crucial time to elapse between spotting the disease and killing infected animals. If he had just talked to a few agricultural historians, he would have heard how a 1920s outbreak spread chiefly because of the delay from report to slaughter. But he never learned that lesson.  Still, the buck hardly stops with him. The biggest cock-ups occurred far above his pay grade. The army was called in too late; there was complete indecision on the countryside - first visitors were told to keep out, then urged to come back in - and constant vacillation on vaccination, with talks, consultations and delays but no resolution. All these failures belong not to Nick Brown, but Tony Blair.  As a prime minister who declared himself in personal charge of this crisis, it fell to him to enlist the MoD or to make a firm decision on vaccination. That he did neither dents his constant boasts of competence: on foot and mouth he dithered as badly as John Major ever did.  These are, however, minor charges on the PM's rap sheet. His greatest failure was one of leadership. He should have been able to do what Maff and Brown did not - to see the big picture. He should have asked why the policy of slaughter existed in the first place, rather than blindly following it. He would have been told the aim was to eradicate foot and mouth as quickly as possible so that Britain could soon regain its disease-free status.  If he'd wondered why that mattered, he would have been told it was essential for Britain's meat export industry. ""How much is that worth?"" he might have asked, only to be told, on Maff's own figures, that the total amounted to £592m. He could then have compared that sum to the £64bn generated by British tourism, and worked out whether it was worth jeopardising that - by showing the world TV pictures of Britain in flames - for the sake of selling lamb, pork and beef abroad.  In other words, a genuine act of leadership would have been to bin Maff's outdated files and think about the British economy that exists today. He could have stopped the slaughter, opting for limited vaccination instead - saving billions of pounds and millions of animals.  He did not, because that would have risked antagonising the farming lobby - next in line in the great foot and mouth rollcall of shame. Their weepy protests for their slaughtered herds, even as they refused a vaccination policy that might have saved animal lives, exposed the farming lobby for what it is: defenders of an economic interest. It was their short-sighted, profit-seeking pursuit of the export trade that drove the insane slaughter policy. As the veterinary historian Abigail Woods puts it: ""The economic interest of a small section of the farming community seems to have governed the country.""  The prosecution is not finished yet. The animal welfare movement was missing in action throughout the whole ordeal. Their only presence came in the form of RSPCA inspectors, cheerfully on hand during the mass culls. They did not raise their voices in protest; they did not attempt the blockades they once mounted to stop live exports of veal calves or the demos they stage outside laboratories involved in animal experimentation. They stayed silent, perhaps believing that such creatures were doomed through intensive farming anyway, and that a funeral pyre was no worse than an abattoir. Maybe, says Woods, ""they would rather save a single fox than a couple of million cattle"".  Their record is appalling, along with everyone else connected with this sorry story. We need a serious, probing public inquiry to lay bare what really happened. For a kind of collective madness descended on these islands - and we were all infected by it."

They know they shouldn't really, but they just can't stop themselves.

They are like hungry schoolboys. (Mr Hague looks permanently like a hungry schoolboy). They haven't had anything decent to eat since goodness knows when. And there, cooling on the window sill, is a delicious apple pie.

They know they shouldn't take it. They know they'll get into trouble. They know that they'll get stomach pains if they scoff it all. But they cannot help it.

You can hardly blame them. The more things deteriorate for the Government, the worse they become for the Tories. Just when Mr Hague must have thought that his job couldn't get any more horrible, someone leaked a story that he intends to sack the older half of his shadow cabinet, so he has had to spend the last 48 hours desperately sucking up to that collection of misfits, malfeasors and ghouls. (To quote Jeremy Hardy, if they'd all been born in the same village, you'd blame pollution in the water supply.)

Not that Northern Ireland isn't a legitimate subject. Not that the Government is definitely right in an appallingly difficult judgment call. It's just that for 30 years the general view at Westminster has been that however awful our opponents are, the IRA and the paramilitaries are a thousand times worse, so we'd better stick together.

Mr Hague asked six long questions yesterday and got six equally long answers. He seemed to be convinced that Mr Blair was trying to prevent him from raising the issue. He was copying those pork-pie hatted columnists in the old-fashioned tabloids: ''The Man They Cannot Gag!''

For his part, Mr Blair seemed wounded. He accepted that the process was imperfect and the peace it had created was imperfect. ''But it is better than no process and no peace at all.''

The Tory Government had had to make difficult judgments too. ''They were in secret negotiations with the IRA, denied they were doing so, came to the House and admitted it, and when they did so, not one of us complained, because we knew how difficult the process was.''

''Opposition members may complain!'' said Mr Hague, waving his arm at the Labour benches. Did he imagine, subconsciously, that his party was still in power? Or had he realised that there was precious little opposition to be found on his own side?

Mr Blair warned about ''the enormous consequences'' of interrupting the process now. ''Peace in our time!'' said Mr Michael Fabricant, annoyingly, since Mr Blair is no Neville Chamberlain, and because Mickey, just back from Australia, has an alarmingly tanned face and something I have never seen before, a tanned wig on top of it.

Mr Blair has often been lucky in his opponents, and the lingering rancour was soon dispelled by Teresa Gorman, who rose to quote pessimistic union leaders on the state of the economy. Mr Edmonds of the G&B had been critical. So had ''Mr Bill Morris of the, er, G. T. W. U. M . . .'' 

Mrs Gorman continued with a random selection from the alphabet, like an Enigma machine preparing for Arnhem. As MPs chortled, she said firmly: ''Mr Morris, the leader of one of our major unions!''

'''Ave another G&T'' growled Dennis Skinner. (Or some more HRT, he might have added.)

Someone complained that William Hague had taken up too much time. The Speaker agreed. ''The questions are too long, and the answers are too long,'' she said crisply.

This is the closest she has ever come to a full frontal attack on the Prime Minister. Sadly, he was not there to hear it, having scarpered the moment he could. Mr Blair does not believe in spending a moment longer in the Chamber than is absolutely necessary."

We need a serious, probing public inquiry to lay bare what really happened. For a kind of collective madness descended on these islands - and we were all infected by it.","The flames turning the night sky orange, the stench of burning flesh - no wonder the talk in the countryside is of apocalypse. ""We are on the threshold of Armageddon,"" warns the National Farmers Union man in Devon, girding himself for another night of slaughter, another bonfire of the carcasses. It is, to be sure, a medieval image, those piles of animal corpses being put to the flame - the pictures in the papers looking more like tapestries than photographs. And the panic is real. Farmers, already reeling after BSE and falling food prices, fear this could be the final blow. The Samaritans are on standby.  The rest of the nation stands back, heeding the warnings to keep its distance. To urban folk, this whole scene looks like one of those 1950s sci-fi tales - Quatermass or Day of the Triffids. Sealed-off farms, a deadly virus, government warnings to stay away: all that's needed now is for the army to move in. But townies have two other reactions to the foot and mouth epidemic sweeping Britain - reactions which could be as decisive for the farmers' fate as the virus itself. Neither will bring much comfort.  The first is confusion. Amid all the talk of European export bans, cancelled rugby matches and delayed general elections, plenty of people are still stuck on rather more basic questions. Like: what the hell is it? And: how might it affect me?  I've heard people shouting at the radio and TV, demanding answers to those questions. BSE they could understand: they knew cows went mad, visibly stumbling and slobbering in TV footage played over and over again, and that humans could contract a terrifying and lethal version of the disease.  Foot and mouth sounds so much simpler than bovine spongiform encephalopathy but my guess is that most non-rural folk remain baffled as to what it is. From the tone of the media coverage, and the end-of-the-world warnings from farmers, most Britons probably reckon F&amp;M is a killer disease which, once it touches a herd, rapidly wipes out the lot. As for humans, it's surely a death sentence to eat meat infected with the bug: your foot probably falls off and your mouth seizes up forever. Why else would government rules insist that infected animals be slaughtered instantly and the disease be eradicated so absolutely? It must be a merciless plague.  Not quite. If human beings eat meat infected with F&amp;M, they do not die; at most they might get the odd cold sore. As for animals, foot and mouth rarely kills them either. Some of the herd's sick or young are vulnerable, but for most a bout of F&amp;M means little more than blisters around the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves, an occasional spot of   lameness and a loss of appetite. The animal soon recovers and the whole thing lasts no more than two to three weeks.  So why all the fuss? The clue is in that last symptom: loss of appetite. For a sheep with F&amp;M stops gaining weight, an infected cow produces less milk. The animal does not suffer or die - it just becomes less productive, yielding a less juicy lamb chop or fewer pints of milk. In an industry that has become ultra-intensive - squeezing every last drop of value from a sheep, pig or cow - even this slight loss of productivity can make the difference between profit and loss. Put simply, foot and mouth is an economic disease.  A less-intensive brand of farming might take the old 19th-century attitude to F &amp;M: let it run. Back then, says agricultural historian Abigail Woods, who writes on the topic in today's Society section, ""no one took any notice of it at all, no one batted an eye-lid."" Today's consumers wouldn't notice the difference either.  But farmers can't just let foot and mouth come in, do its worst and blow away - even if that would be the most rational response. Foreign markets won't tolerate infected meat even if we would: the farmers' export trade would collapse. The law demands an extreme response too. A long outdated insistence that British meat be absolutely disease-free has led to the slaughter-on-sight policy, even when it is the emergency measures, not the virus itself, which really threatens farmers' livelihoods. The cure is worse than the disease.  Still, don't expect too much sympathy from the rest of us. For if this outbreak has triggered our incomprehension of modern farming, it has also exposed our indifference to its plight. Typical of the urban mood was Ken Livingstone's instant response, calling on the Countryside Alliance to cancel its planned march on London. With an unerring instinct for popular feeling, the mayor guessed at most Londoners' attitude to the farmers: keep out, and take your mucky boots and strange germs with you. The Alliance duly called the event off.  It's not hard to explain this urban chilliness toward the countryside. BSE was a turning point, breaking forever the cosy Farmer Giles myth of yore: suddenly Britons saw farms as giant agri-businesses, animal factories with profit the only motive. Never mind that many farmers didn't realise they were turning their livestock into cannibals: the trust was broken.  The countryside's war on the Labour government has not helped. Not because they don't have a good case: the depletion of rural bus services and post offices is real. What turns townies off is that country folk never marched on London about any of  those concerns: it was only when Labour moved against foxhunting that the countryside got organised. If the Alliance had been formed to save village schools, rather than the right to kill foxes, perhaps they would have enjoyed wider sympathy.  There's one more cause of the town's cold shoulder to the country and it's an irony. For it was Conservative governments - the farmers' party - who per suaded Britons that if an industry is uneconomic, then it must go, even if that destroys communities and their way of life. Pit villages made that plea in the 1980s but no one listened - least of all the farmers who kept voting Tory. Yet now they insist that Britain must subsidise their industry, even if we could import their product more cheaply from abroad. If that logic couldn't save the miners, why should it save them?  The farmers will argue that food is a special case. Britons, they reckon, remember the war - where we had to feed ourselves to stay alive. But few hold to that logic anymore: that's why Thatcherism didn't mind savaging our steel industry, even though we might need that one day to arm ourselves. No, it's a globalised world now; Britons won't mind filling their shopping trolleys from abroad. They do so already.   That sounds harsh and it is. It also lets us off the hook too easily. For if farmers have been driven to ever more intensive methods, it's partly to satisfy our demand for cheap food. As the novelist Jonathan Coe, whose What a Carve Up! skewered the food industry in the mid-90s, told me yesterday, ""absolute consumer choice"" comes at a terrible price - and it is the farmers now facing ruin who seem set to pay it.  So Frederick Forsyth can hint darkly in the Daily Mail that the foot and mouth virus was introduced deliberately, as a Labour plot against the countryside. But most Britons know better. They know that if farmers are reaping a bitter harvest now, they - and we - sowed much of it ourselves."
0,"The list of victims is long. At the head of it should be the nearly 3m animals slaughtered and burned, along with the 68,000 cows, sheep and pigs set to follow them on to the funeral pyres. Next on the list would be the clutch of farmers who, despite £125m already pledged in compensation, will be driven out of business by an epidemic that swept through their land as devastating as a tornado. After them, the hoteliers and restaurateurs who saw their livelihoods dry up as the world's travellers declared Britain a medievally benighted no-go area. Who else might we list as victims of the great foot and mouth crisis of 2001, now said to be in its endgame? We probably should add the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which seems set for a post-election cull of its own: the death sentence may even be declared in today's Labour manifesto. Along with Maff, place its hapless minister, Nick Brown. He, too, looks set for the chopping block - though that will not be announced by Tony Blair in Birmingham today.  The victims are many and we will hear their stories for years to come. More reluctant to come forward may be those who want to bury this episode along with the animal carcasses. They are the culprits.  For any examination of this extraordinary saga - which paralysed a nation and suspended democracy for the only time in our peacetime history - reveals a complete systemic failure. Not one group or institution involved emerges with any credit; they all failed in their most basic duty. Long after the last pyre has stopped burning, foot and mouth will stand as an indictment of British public life - and of the very way we govern ourselves.  Since no institution is immune, let's start with my own. The media failed from the outset, by never explaining the most basic facts of this disease. When I wrote in February that foot and mouth was not a killer, but amounted to flu for animals and, at worst, a cold-sore for human beings, I was inundated with shocked responses from readers who had watched TV, read the papers and listened to the radio - but had never once been told the symptoms of a condition instantly branded a national emergency. For weeks the media aired terrifying pictures and wore long faces but refused to perform its fundamental task: stating the facts.  Next we should target government, at every level. Maff did almost everything wrong. Civil servants succumbed to that perennial bureaucratic habit: instead of thinking, they reached for the files. They saw that the past response to foot and mouth had always been to shut down the countryside and impose a blanket policy of slaughter. That was how it had been in 1967, so that's how it would be in 2001. Even the ""no entry"" signs Maff produced were printed in retro, postwar type: emblems of a dumb obedience to the past script and a failure to think anew.  Ministers were no better. Nick Brown did not demand a strategic overview from his department; he simply went for crisis control. He obeyed his civil servants, followed precedent and ordered mass slaughter. But even that he did not do properly, failing to move quickly enough, allowing crucial time to elapse between spotting the disease and killing infected animals. If he had just talked to a few agricultural historians, he would have heard how a 1920s outbreak spread chiefly because of the delay from report to slaughter. But he never learned that lesson.  Still, the buck hardly stops with him. The biggest cock-ups occurred far above his pay grade. The army was called in too late; there was complete indecision on the countryside - first visitors were told to keep out, then urged to come back in - and constant vacillation on vaccination, with talks, consultations and delays but no resolution. All these failures belong not to Nick Brown, but Tony Blair.  As a prime minister who declared himself in personal charge of this crisis, it fell to him to enlist the MoD or to make a firm decision on vaccination. That he did neither dents his constant boasts of competence: on foot and mouth he dithered as badly as John Major ever did.  These are, however, minor charges on the PM's rap sheet. His greatest failure was one of leadership. He should have been able to do what Maff and Brown did not - to see the big picture. He should have asked why the policy of slaughter existed in the first place, rather than blindly following it. He would have been told the aim was to eradicate foot and mouth as quickly as possible so that Britain could soon regain its disease-free status.  If he'd wondered why that mattered, he would have been told it was essential for Britain's meat export industry. ""How much is that worth?"" he might have asked, only to be told, on Maff's own figures, that the total amounted to £592m. He could then have compared that sum to the £64bn generated by British tourism, and worked out whether it was worth jeopardising that - by showing the world TV pictures of Britain in flames - for the sake of selling lamb, pork and beef abroad.  In other words, a genuine act of leadership would have been to bin Maff's outdated files and think about the British economy that exists today. He could have stopped the slaughter, opting for limited vaccination instead - saving billions of pounds and millions of animals.  He did not, because that would have risked antagonising the farming lobby - next in line in the great foot and mouth rollcall of shame. Their weepy protests for their slaughtered herds, even as they refused a vaccination policy that might have saved animal lives, exposed the farming lobby for what it is: defenders of an economic interest. It was their short-sighted, profit-seeking pursuit of the export trade that drove the insane slaughter policy. As the veterinary historian Abigail Woods puts it: ""The economic interest of a small section of the farming community seems to have governed the country.""  The prosecution is not finished yet. The animal welfare movement was missing in action throughout the whole ordeal. Their only presence came in the form of RSPCA inspectors, cheerfully on hand during the mass culls. They did not raise their voices in protest; they did not attempt the blockades they once mounted to stop live exports of veal calves or the demos they stage outside laboratories involved in animal experimentation. They stayed silent, perhaps believing that such creatures were doomed through intensive farming anyway, and that a funeral pyre was no worse than an abattoir. Maybe, says Woods, ""they would rather save a single fox than a couple of million cattle"".  Their record is appalling, along with everyone else connected with this sorry story. We need a serious, probing public inquiry to lay bare what really happened. For a kind of collective madness descended on these islands - and we were all infected by it.","We're losing the art of public interaction. The spaces - from a public park to a forum for public exchange - where social debate and contemplation can take place are eroding before our eyes. Two very disparate and under-reported initiatives were launched last week, both rooted in this concern - precursors perhaps of the beginning of civil society's fight back. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) delivered its manifesto for better public spaces, saying that a combination of powerful private interests, aggressive litigiousness and timidity by public authorities were together undermining public space.  Suffolk County Council's infamous decision to outlaw hanging baskets from some lampposts in Bury St Edmunds is the most graphic example of the general trend. Fear that the baskets might fall and hurt someone, sparking an expensive compensation claim, had forced the county council to act. Nor is it an idle fear. Manchester City Council's budget for compensation claims now exceeds its budget for repairing pavements - also, ironically, the source of many claims for compensation.  All around the country, according to Cabe, boating lakes, markets, adventure playgrounds, and public parks are under growing threat because they are deemed too risky in the face of claims for compensation from some aggrieved injured litigant or that they are too expensive to protect from the ambitions of private developers - and there is too little protest about the wider cost to us of access being reduced or even phased out altogether.  Yet there is a wealth of evidence that being able to stroll in a park and breathe good air prolongs life expectancy; that having somewhere to play reduces kids' obesity; that having wide pavements and well-lit bus stops reduces crime. It is worth paying to have park keepers, finding funds to pay compensation and imposing the planning controls to protect public space. Such things enhance our lives. By refusing to pay for our public sphere we collude in undermining it.  The Royal Society of Arts is worried that our well-being is under equal pressure from another source. We are losing the capacity to engage in anything other than private conversation about private passions; even public debate is increasingly about our private loves, hates and emotions - and when public debate is about something public, say the European constitution, or even the decline in public space, it is conducted in a way designed not to illuminate or inform.  There is certainly no dialogue; it is two sides duelling, holding their views with unshakeable and unchanging conviction, giving no quarter and spinning every fact with a vengeance, with the   public cast as onlookers to a gladiatorial spectacle. Their role is to enjoy the sparks rather than learn or modify their opinions in the light of the evidence.  The RSA's response is to launch a national series of coffee-house debates based on the coffee-house out of which it was born 250 years ago.  It wants to recreate the capacity to be engaged in public affairs, and that means, believes Britain's most venerable think-tank, that we need to acquire again the art of thinking aloud about public issues in an environment where you are not pounced on for making a mistake, not toeing the party line or excoriated for saying something illogical.  Creative conversation, when it happens, is intoxicating; interlocuters inspire and fire new thoughts in each other. Let us hope that we all know this sensation; but nobody would say good conversation characterises our current public realm. The Royal Society wants us to talk in today's coffee-houses - 500 Starbucks - and email them the results of our conversations.  I welcome both initiatives. We are locked in a vicious circle, in which declining public space begets the very excessive individualism that feeds self-interested litigiousness and the bear-baiting, take-no-prisoners attitude towards public debate.  What drives the compensation culture is the decline in people's sense of belonging to a wider public culture. This fuels a disproportionate sense of personal injury - along with the prospect of some easy money.  Equally, media interviews where the interviewer sets out to entrap and draw blood do nothing to enlarge public understanding - but that is because the listener and viewer collude in seeing the Minister, MP or official in the same way as the media. That is, not as legitimate representatives of a public realm that can only be sustained in the last resort if we respect it; rather, as somebody we want to see discomfited or commit a gaffe. Public life has become a kind of soap opera in which issues are less important than the private foibles, wobbles and passions of the actors in the drama.  Charles Kennedy's sweating or Michael Portillo's gay experiences are one part of this - the other is extraordinary over-exaggeration. There are 12 weeks to stop a European superstate; MMR vaccine causes autism; the Six Nations rugby tournament is bankrupt as a sports spectacle. Choose your issue and you know what I mean.  Even as I write this I'm aware of the counter arguments; the public parks I know well seem in rude good health. And if some toffs are complaining about the vulgarity and prurience of the British media, it was ever thus. The greater truth is its vitality - and people have the wit to see through the hype. Public debate is always going to be edgy with debaters probing for any advantage they can; to imagine it should be conducted as some glorified seminar is to bay for the moon.  And why shouldn't we be interested in the personal dimensions of our public figures?  And yet I stick to my guns. There is a rise in the compensation culture and there is a degradation in how public argument is conducted. What connects them both is a diminishing sense of why what we hold in common is as important to our well-being as the freedom to pursue our self-interest and accent only the personal. And this disappearing collectivity is, for example, why the BBC is under assault; it is why, in a larger sense, we are so bad-tempered and ill at ease with ourselves.  But the desire for better co-exists with the same trends. Thus Cabe and the RSA last week. Thus the polls that simultaneously show huge support for the BBC even while it is denigrated. Thus the periodic interest in the idea of new newspapers (the latest is Stephen Glover's the  World) which are built on public interest and impartial news journalism.  Such tensions are a feature of the age. The idea of 'the public' is too weak. It is only if we recognise that and fight back to restore its place that we have any hope of reasserting the values that are, literally, good for us all.  I am on the side of those who want to fight back."
1,"We didn't see a kiss, nor the moment they were legally married - but we did at least catch a glimpse into the future. On Saturday we saw the court of Charles III. The wedding of the Prince of Wales to Camilla Parker Bowles was the most public gathering yet for a new establishment in waiting, the men and women who surround the man who would be king. From my perch on the roof of the Guard Room, inside the ramparts of Windsor Castle, I counted them in and counted them out.  They were easy to spot because they fitted none of the other more formal categories. They were not governors-general of remote commonwealth nations, nor serene highnesses from faraway royal dynasties. They were not ""great officers of state"" - though the Master of the Horse was there, of course, along with the Lord Chamberlain and the Marquess of Cholmondeley. (This may be the 21st century but these people all still exist.)  Nor were they party leaders, all of whom chose to Gordon Brown it and wear lounge suits rather than the morning dress adopted by almost every other man present. Ever since the chancellor eschewed white tie for his Mansion House speech in 1997, politicians seem to have developed an allergy to over-frilly get-up - perhaps fearing it will dent their democratic credentials. Not that this precaution did Tony Blair much good: he got booed as he arrived at St George's Chapel.  No, the new courtiers were a category unto themselves. They were people whose name and fame had been earned rather than inherited and who would be recognisable to those who do not count the court circular among their bedtime reading.  Leading them were the theatrical folk: Stephen Fry, Meera Syal, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Rowan Atkinson, Prunella Scales, Timothy West (who delivered a Wordsworth poem at the service), Joanna Lumley (who seems to have ""The Lovely"" attached to her name, rather in the manner of a royal title), Edward Fox, John Mortimer, Kenneth Branagh, Jools Holland, Richard E Grant, Trudi Styler and playwright Ronnie Harwood. TV celebrity Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was a crowd-pleasing addition, sashaying into the chapel as if it were a catwalk. As one commentator quipped drily, it was more Hello! than Debretts.  Non-showbiz courtiers were there, too: loyal interviewer Jonathan Dimbleby, knighted green Sir Jonathon Porritt, schools scourge Chris Woodhead (in lounge suit). And, moving effortlessly between them all, the media grandees Lords Bragg and Rees-Mogg and Sir David Frost.  What, one began to wonder, might connect this illustrious group? What common set of traits might come to define this future Carolinian court?  It is clearly not the rigid, snobbish aristocracy of the late Queen Mother's Gosford Park set, nor the horse-obsessed tedium of the Queen's world. But nor is it the mass-appeal, Mail-reading sensibility of Diana - though, it cannot be denied, Phil Collins was in the church on Saturday.  Instead, Charles's preference seems to be for upper crust with a twist. Thus he likes actors, as royals have before - but he includes one who is openly gay and two who are Asian, in the form of Fry, Syal and Bhaskar. He includes a grand old man of letters in his circle but his choice, John Mortimer, is an avowed socialist. He has a thriller writer close by, but while the Queen Mum had a weakness for Dick Francis, Charles opts for the more cerebral and Labour-supporting Robert Harris.  Most typically, he counts as a friend a pillar of the broadcasting establishment - yet Jonathan Dimbleby is also president of the Soil Association. That seems to capture the defining feature of the Charles court. They are pukka and top drawer, but with a teeny-weeny, alternative streak. They are posh - but organic posh.  The wedding itself fit that bill - still a royal event, but less formal than most. So the two families travelled around in white, hired minibuses - bearing the corporate logo of Windsorian, which might be a brand name for the day the royals are privatised - princes and princesses ferried about like football teams arriving for a cup final. In an inadvertently populist touch, Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne, spotted herself on one of the giant TV monitors and pointed - just as the regular folk in the crowd had been doing all afternoon.  Still, some traditions were maintained. The prince and his new duchess had invited representatives of their pet charities to share their special day. Except these footsoldiers for groups like the British Horse Loggers, the Poultry Club of Great Britain and the Specialist Cheesemakers' Association were not exactly invited to the wedding, though many of them were fully dressed for the occasion. Rather, their tickets entitled them to stand outside in an enclosure, fending off the April chill for three and a half hours as they waited for the newlyweds to emerge.  Still, they didn't seem to mind. David Yendoll of the St Mary's Priory Trust had driven from Abergavenny: he thought it marvellous that people like him, ""the great unwashed were given orders of service, so that we could follow and join in"".  Equally, for all the prince's insistence that he wants to be ""defender of faiths"" and leader of a multicultural Britain, the only religious representatives listed were Anglicans. The message seemed pretty clear: Charles may have the odd interesting friend, but he is still who he is.  As always, this royal event will be seized on as a useful window into the kind of country Britain is becoming. What did we see on Saturday? A country that is less stuffy and formal: note William and Harry's daubing of ""Prince and Duchess"", a la Kevin and Tracey, on the couple's car windscreen. And a country that has made its peace with divorce. There was some loud booing when Charles and Camilla arrived for the legal ceremony, but that came from a few diehard Diana-ites. Most were forgiving, happy to allow a middle-aged couple a second chance. In the words of Anne Gillott from Winchester, ""If William and Harry have adapted, who am I to judge?""  But this spirit of tolerance should not be misunderstood. For much of it is indifference. The crowds in Windsor were thin, not much bigger than in the centre of any busy market town on a Saturday. When they tried to raise three cheers for the couple during the walkabout, they could only muster two. Radio 5 Live, which knows its audience well, cut short its wedding coverage to switch to Aintree in advance of the Grand National.  There was a time when the BBC would never have dared such a thing, but Britain is a different country now. Twenty-five years ago, the closure of a big car plant could have brought down the government. Not many think Rover will do that now. A quarter century ago, Britons would not have reacted so strongly to the death of a pope. We're different now.  Perhaps this is why the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury seemed so oddly detached from the proceedings on Saturday. Perhaps they realise these current trends do not augur happily for either of the institutions they lead. This weekend the new ethos served Charles well - it shrugged its shoulders and allowed him to do what he wants - but, one day, King Charles may come to lament the very same change.","London was once again a city of migrants yesterday. For the second time in two weeks, the capital's streets were filled not with the usual cars and buses but thick, snaking columns of people on the move.These refugees from the city did not march with wagons piled high or bundles on their back, but with suitcases on wheels and mobile phones in their hands - just as they had a fortnight ago. Told that the London Underground had been closed, they were setting off on the long march back home.""Oh no, not again,"" was the first thought to pass through Isabelle Hans's mind. A charity worker, she found herself barred from her office just around the corner from Warren Street tube, the building hidden behind the blue and white plastic ribbons of a police cordon - just as it had been on July 7.Initial word suggested a macabre rerun of that fateful day: four explosions, three trains and a bus, one blast for each point of the compass around the centre of London.The pattern looked identical, so Londoners repeated their own behaviour, as if weary veterans of this new form of urban warfare.They texted their friends and family; they picked up snippets of news from portable radios or the internet; they cut short their working day and left offices in mid-afternoon for a journey on foot which they knew could take several hours.Even if the ritual was a repeat, the mood seemed different. Much was made of the stoicism of Londoners on July 7, an unruffled calm exhibited even by those who narrowly escaped the attacks. Yesterday, by all accounts, was not like that.Witnesses at the Oval station and elsewhere said that once they heard the sound of an explosion, or breathed in the acrid smell of smoke, passengers fell rapidly into a collective panic.There were reports of desperate stampedes as people rushed to get off trains and out of stations.One man at Warren Street station showed the television cameras a pile of sandals and flip-flops he had collected - abandoned by their owners as they ""ran for their lives"".Caitlin Jackson, 22, was at Leicester Square station as it was being evacuated.""I never saw people move as fast as that in my life. Everybody was quiet, it was all silent. But they had that panicked look on their faces.""Perhaps on July 7 the sheer surprise of the attacks numbed Londoners' reactions. The memory of July 7, the fear that they were about to experience an equally lethal rerun, seems to have had the opposite effect yesterday.The atmosphere lifted a bit once word spread that there were no fatalities. There was little of that July 7 tremble in the voice yesterday.""It's more fascination than panic,"" said David Sanderson, a business analyst at the Abbey bank, who had headed out in the lunch hour only to be shut out of his place of work. He joined the crowd behind police lines at Warren Street, waiting and watching.He was on the normally thronging thoroughfare of Tottenham Court Road, now quiet, filled with pedestrians and the occasional fire engine or police car. In common with several roads in the capital, what is usually a traffic-filled artery had become little more than a wide pedestrian path.But once the panic subsided, it was not the stubborn resilience of London cliche that was revealed. Instead there was frustration, irritation and a glimpse of the one thing terrorists crave most: fear and a glum recognition that maybe life cannot go on as normal.Dean Seddon, 23, had made the salesman's journey to London from St Helens - against his wife's wishes. ""She was going mad with me for coming,"" he said. At Charing Cross station he had been faced with a ""wave of people, saying 'Run! Run!'"" And now he thought his wife was right. Pulling his trolley-suitcase, hoping he could somehow get back to Merseyside, he had resolved not to come back to the capital ""for a while"" at least.Heidi Ashton, 20, had her three-year-old son asleep in a pushchair and had made up her mind too. No more buses or tubes for her, and certainly not for her child. Ms Jackson had just got off the phone after speaking to her parents, back in her native Canada. They had told her that enough was enough; it was time to come home.""Personally, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety; I'm pissed off,"" said Martina Leeven, 35, an officer with the Changing Faces charity. That morning, she had asked herself whether it was really safe to travel on the Underground. She had decided not. Pointing at her orange trainers, she told how she had, for the first time, done the hour's walk from Bethnal Green instead. ""I'm wondering, is this my life now?""She felt angry, not so much at the politicians or even the terrorists, but at ""the state of the world"".Her colleague, Michelle Bativala, agreed. The revelation that one of the July 7 bombers had been a primary school teacher had shaken her badly. ""Before you were looking for someone fanatical,"" she said. ""Now it could be anyone.""Ms Leeven said she had not seen anyone rushed or panicked, but rather ""walking around with a question mark on their faces."" It seemed to describe London itself: not quaking - yet - nor deluged with fresh grief. But etched with a giant question mark, wondering what tomorrow might bring."

This weekend the new ethos served Charles well - it shrugged its shoulders and allowed him to do what he wants - but, one day, King Charles may come to lament the very same change.","Every year in this country, several hundred people are murdered. Of the hundreds, only a minority are ever widely reported. Of the minority, only a handful imprint themselves upon the psyche of a nation. And of the handful, only one or two in a decade become so infamous that they become the emblematic murders of their era. The killing of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by Ian Huntley in the village of Soham is one of those cases. No murder investigation has ever been more lavishly reported. No murder victims have ever acquired the iconic status of Holly and Jessica in their Beckham shirts. (Would the crime have captured the nation if they had been Norwich City fans?) Few murder trials have dominated the news for so long as the one that ended at the Old Bailey yesterday.  Ian Huntley has now been instantly consigned to a very select national pandemonium of the nation's most loathed killers. Some of his more recent fellow inmates include Fred and Rose West, Dennis Nilsen, Peter Sutcliffe, Harry Roberts, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. More distant denizens include Dr Harvey Crippen, Jack the Ripper and William Corder of Red Barn fame.  Like them, Huntley will now become a byword for evil and Soham a place like Cranley Gardens and Saddleworth moor, remembered for one awful thing alone. Already last night, the broadcasting schedules were cleared for extended special reports, a rare and revealing tribute to the case. Books will now be hastily written about Huntley's crimes. Official inquiries will be held into how such a man could do such things. In time, criminologists, cultural commentators, novelists and film-makers will all rake over the case in their own ways.  Though the trend in murder is upwards, it remains a very rare crime. Holly and Jessica were two of the total of 1,048 homicides in 2002-03 in England and Wales (the figure has been greatly inflated by the work of Dr Harold Shipman). Their chance of being a murder victim - like yours and mine - was around one in 60,000. Yet murder is obviously also the gravest of all crimes, one of the only serious offences to carry a mandatory sentence. For all their rarity, that select group of emblematic murders has always reflected something special about the dangers, fears and myths of the society in which they took place.  In his 1946 essay on the decline of the English murder, George Orwell reflected on the characteristics of the killings that, then as now, filled the pages of the News of the World. The English murderer, Orwell wrote, would normally be a ""little man of the professional class"", living a respectable and conformist life in the suburbs. He would ""go astray"" through cherishing a passion for his secretary or another man's wife. He would bring himself to the point of murder only after great wrestling with his conscience. Having determined on murder, he then planned   the crime - normally a poisoning - with the utmost cunning, only to be undone by some small unforeseen error. Such dramas, Orwell concluded, proved irresistible to the readers of middle Britain because they were the ""product of a stable society where the all-prevailing hypocrisy did at least ensure that crimes as serious as murder should have strong emotions behind them"".  Nearly 60 years after Orwell, we are still mesmerised by murder. But the characteristics of the emblematic murder of today are very different from those noted by Orwell. This is strikingly true of the Soham murders, which were committed by a minor public official rather than a professional person, apparently answering to his sexual demons not a cherished passion, and carried out seemingly on the spur of the moment rather than after great planning. If the distinguishing feature of the emblematic murder of the past was its careful premeditation, the equivalent feature of today's is its randomness and its opportunism.  This is why the unprecedented intensity of the coverage of the case is so important. Roy Hattersley rightly observed last week that there has never been anything like it. Day after day the case has dominated the airwaves and the front pages. For sheer volume Soham has eclipsed anything generated by the Wests or even by the murder of the toddler James Bulger, never mind the Moors murders or even the penny dreadfuls long ago.  The volume of coverage has been matched only by its often provocative stridency, especially in the weeks that followed the arrests of Huntley and Maxine Carr. This led the attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, to tell journalists last month that ""at times some of the reporting of the investigation and trial has been quite frankly unacceptable"". It was hardly surprising that Carr was taunted in Holloway before the trial as a second Myra Hindley. Carr was manifestly no such thing, but the tabloid depictions of her in the autumn of 2002 left no doubt that, for some newspaper editors and their readers, Carr now filled the post of national female demon left vacant by Hindley's death.  With every possible due respect to the murdered girls and their families, it has to be aggressively stated that the coverage of this case has been wholly out of proportion to its implied meaning. The subtext of the case is that your daughters are at risk of being murdered if they go out alone, even in a quiet East Anglian village, never mind on the mean streets of the inner city. Yet this is scarcely more true today than it has ever been.   Holly and Jessica, both aged 10, fell into the category of the population - girls aged between five and 16 - that is least likely of all of us to be the victims of murder. When young people are murdered, which after the age of 12 months they rarely are, by far the chief threat to them comes from their parents, then by other adults known to them (as Huntley was), but not from strangers. Boys, moreover, are more likely to be murdered than girls.  ""It was the powder keg waiting for the match. I was the match,"" Dennis Nilsen wrote about his own murder spree 20 years ago, implying that someone like himself lurks around every corner of every street. Some will say the same about Huntley's opportunist killings too. The persistent implication is that something like this can happen to anyone, any time, anywhere.  But the reality is that it can't and doesn't. Huntley's was an exceptionally awful crime, but it was also exceptionally unusual. It has been invested with national meaning less because of the crime than because of the way it has been reported. Under pressure from 24-hour news TV channels and the tabloids, the mainstream TV channels and what were then all still broadsheets bowed before the storm. The episode certainly tells us something about the kind of society we have become, but the truth is that it tells us rather more about the decline of the English media than it does about the decline of the English murder.    <BR>"
1,"If, as the Queen tells us, ""there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge"", how does she know about them? The answer to that conundrum is that there is no answer. Nothing about the monarchy is rational. We inhabit a Ruritanian fantasy in which the parliamentary year begins with the monarch - magnificent at mid-morning in evening dress and tiara - reading the details of the government's legislative programme from a piece of hand-inscribed vellum.  That is the dull routine of royal family life. From time to time it erupts into a demonstration that the notion on which it is built is inherently dangerous as well as absurd. The amount of time and space which has been wasted on a butler who became obsessed with his employer is the direct result of the fiction that there is something special about the royal family. That is only true if, by special, we mean strange. The squalid absurdity of the latest revelations is illustrated by a growing feeling of sympathy for Mohamed Al Fayed. The man who is adjudged unworthy of a British passport must deeply regret that his son became associated with such a disreputable bunch.  Writing about the royal family's foibles is, for me, a novelty. Ten days ago, I was about to resign from the Campaign for an Elected Head of State because of its attitude towards the Windsors' private lives, as revealed in the Panorama investigation of Camilla Parker Bowles's prospects of becoming queen. The simulated meeting of the campaign's committee showed an intolerably cynical approach to the business of promoting a republic. Professor Stephen Haseler, the chairman, announced that the personal conduct of the Prince of Wales must be exploited in the drive to end the hereditary monarchy.  My arguments in favour of an elected head of state have always been built around the inadequacy of the institution, not the shortcomings of the individuals. Of course, I accepted that the heredity principle is based on the notion of a genetically distinct family, with everything that family does - in private as well as public - providing evidence of its suitability to rule.  But I was against the monarchy because it embodied the idea of a social hierarchy and encouraged the nation to look back instead of forward, not because the heir to the throne made childishly prurient telephone calls.  I was wrong. The real objection to a monarchy remains the debilitating effect it has upon society. But the damage done by its public existence is compounded by the private conduct of the monarch and her relations. The Queen's role in the Paul Burrell case makes that clear. It is impossible to believe that Her Majesty only realised the significance of her three-hour meeting with Burrell a couple of days before he was to give evidence in his trial for theft. Her personal conduct was clearly influenced by belief in the constitutional fiction on which her status rests. In private as well as public, she was above the law.  Her first instinct - as mother and sovereign - was to preserve the good name of her (royal) family. Initially, that seemed best achieved by keeping well out of the Burrell affair. She only intervened when abdication (in this limited sense) seemed unlikely to prevent revelations about the home life of our dear Princess of Wales.  The intervention hopelessly failed. But that does not reduce its significance. The personal conduct of the royal family, Diana's estrangement from the Prince of Wales, and her weird relationship with staff, combined with her mother-in-law's determination to protect the Windsors' reputation to produce a legal travesty. In the case of Regina versus Burrell,   the defendant was alleged to have stolen property from Regina's daughter-in-law. Then Regina herself became the star witness.  While the monarchy exists, the deference afforded to them will continue to prejudice everything they touch. As long as the reverence was simply extended to the Duke of York being escorted to the Ministry of Defence each day by motorcycle policemen, no great harm was done. The conduct of the Burrell investigation shows the monarchy is not just a bad joke.  Detectives from a squad that specialised in dealing with celebrities - an arrangement which itself says something about society - knew, or ought to have known, that Burrell had claimed to have spoken of his acquisitions during a royal audience. Yet none of them thought it appropriate to check his claim with the Queen. At best, they were overawed at the thought of cross-examining Her Majesty. Some of them may even have imagined that she was beyond their jurisdiction. Either way, justice might well have been denied because of their obsequiousness. The problems of the hereditary monarchy result from its existence. The only solution to any of the consequent absurdities is a republic.","Last Tuesday morning, every national newspaper - including the Guardian - made the Soham murder trial its front-page lead. Some of the headlines were written in taut American colloquialisms, which, as well as saving space, convey an impression of dramatic urgency. The Manchester United replica shirts, in which Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman died, had been ""binned"". Ian Huntley, the principal defendant, ""took the stand"". The effect was so startling that, for a moment, it seemed irresponsible not to read what one tabloid called ""the chilling details"". Most of the stories were illustrated with two photographs. One was of the bath in which Holly Wells was said to have died. The other - reproduced in colour - showed, half-burned at the bottom of a school dustbin, the shirts in which the girls were last seen. I do not follow murder trails with the care that would make me an authority of their coverage by the press. But I cannot recall any recent prosecution being reported in such detail. And Tuesday was only one day in the continuing saga. In the next week, after the judge has summed up and the jury announced its verdict, we can expect the coverage to be augmented by an avalanche of comment.  Newspapers fill their front pages with stories that they judge will attract readers and increase circulation. So we are required to believe - as a result of last Tuesday's unanimous editorial verdict - that the British public, whatever its general taste in journalism, combines in its enthusiasm for information about human suffering. Accounts of Ian Huntley ""sobbing in court"", admitting responsibility for the two girls' deaths and expressing his bitter regret that he cannot ""turn back the clock"" to the time before they died, apparently sold newspapers. It seems that large sections of the great British public have an inexhaustible appetite for horror.  Newspapers have a duty to report the trial of Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr and the right to describe it in whatever way they choose. In a democracy, justice must be done in public. Newspapers often pretend that their penchant for sensation is essential to the national interest rather than to circulation. But, while we are entitled to deplore their hypocrisy, we should not complain too loudly about the run-of-the-mill revelation and routine expos. They have to sell copies to survive. That explains their readiness to supply the salacious details of murder, rape and assault cases once the stories can be legitimised as court reporting. But what about the demand? There is only one word with which to describe the desire for details of the   Soham tragedy. The word is prurience.  All decent people felt unmitigated horror when they heard the simple fact of the two girls' deaths. And no one who has not endured a similar trauma is fully able to imagine the depth of grief in which their parents must still be engulfed. The Chapmans and the Wellses deserve our unqualified sympathy. Absorption in the squalid details of Ian Huntley's behaviour is a strange way in which to show it. Reading his explanation of how he fitted the girls' bodies into the boot of his car is hardly an expression of condolence. The lawyers have to argue about his conduct. But there is something sick about the casual reader following him on that last tragic journey.  Poring over every detail of the evidence and cross-examination - ""Had you disturbed the clothing of either girl before they went into the ditch?"" - is not very different from standing outside the courthouse in the hope of catching a glimpse of the defendant through the window of the prison van or waiting at Tyburn to see the week's hangings. Last week,   the country was awash with sedentary voyeurism.  The vicarious emotions that the accounts of the trial provoked range from the honourable, through the ignoble to the thoroughly perverse. Sentimentalists will claim that by learning of the two girls' suffering they share the parents' grief and loss. Can they really believe that families bereaved by such tragedies want complete strangers to read the necessarily sordid arguments about their children's last hours? It has to happen in court. And the families have shown admirable courage in being there to see justice done. But they are unlikely to find much consolation in headlines such as ""I put the body in the ditch and rolled her down"".  If people really enjoy reading that sort of thing, there is no way in which we can stop newspapers publishing such stories. Nor, in a free society, should we wish to do so. But I resolutely refuse to believe that fascination with the details of vicious death is an inherent part of human nature. How many sales would a serious newspaper lose if, in the days ahead, it reported the result of the Soham trial unelaborated with the salacious details that we must brace ourselves to expect? Regrettably, we shall never know."

The government has done the right thing and the dome gets another chance. Other bidders - now suddenly many more - can come forward and suggest something better than a disgraceful fire-sale at a knock-down price to property developers. It would have been the final scandal of the dome's history. The panic that seized the government at the end of last year is over. There is time to stop and think, time to consider every option - ""as long as it takes,"" says Lord Falconer - no artificial deadlines. But will it be saved as a public space? Now the dome is closed, the spate of bad news that hung over it like a thick smog has lifted. Panic was the danger - the same panic that seized governments before. The Festival of Britain of 1951, besieged by many of the same headlines calling it a monstrous waste of public money, was razed to the ground the day it closed to save further public embarrassment. The incoming Conservative government smashed the Skylon to pieces and bulldozed the Dome of Discovery, both icons that would now be loved and revered landmarks. They couldn't move fast enough to pull down the Crystal Palace after the Great Exhibition of 1851 and remove it to a distant suburb where it later burned to the ground. The moment a great public exhibition closes is the moment when it is least fashionable and least valued. Its value plummets so low people can't even see the value of the land around it. By the time the final deal is done, we will look back on the idea of selling this majestic site for a fraction of its true worth with utter incredulity.  Talking to top London property dealers yesterday, they said there had been a phenomenal conspiracy of silence among the five big property companies who stood by and looked on as Legacy seemed about to be given it almost as a gift. ""We could not believe it,"" said one leading estate agent. Why the silence? Well, it was government business and no one wanted to make trouble, with future contracts in mind. But consider this, said one. Canary Wharf is just 40 seconds' travel time from the dome peninsula. Last November the Canary Wharf Group plc acquired a new 6.3-acre tract of land for development in North Canary Wharf called Shed 35. It cost them £53m. That is the same sum Legacy was proposing to put down on 63 similar acres, with just another £75m to follow later. ""The site value   has soared in the past 20 months since bids were first invited. Now there is a tube and infrastructure, it's a different game."" He reckons a full and fair global competition will bring in a sizeable fortune for the site - and still leave plenty of room for publicly owned space.  Now for round two. This spectacular peninsula is the most beautiful piece of undeveloped urban landscape in the capital, surrounded by the Thames on three sides, under a great wide sky with breathtaking views in all directions. Reached by boat and by one of London's most architecturally exciting new tube stations, this is a dream public space, a park, a treasure. Once sold off and built over, it will be gone for ever, unreclaimable for the public. Richard Rogers, architect of this mighty white structure, is one of those who has been fighting hard behind the scenes to keep it as a publicly owned place for ever. If the Skylon, the Dome of Discovery and the Crystal Palace still stood, how extraordinary it would seem now ever to sell them off. If some of the dome land is now sold well, the dome and its park can remain a public place, with no need to sell it, though it might be rented. The day will come - probably soon - when some Olympic or other sporting or cultural event will need the dome in a capital bereft of wonderful sites. The failure of Wembley Stadium plans is just another example of how badly Britain does great national monuments. But now we have a chance to get this right.  The last great dome crisis forced the Millennium Commission angrily to fork out a final £47m last October. But this sum was never actually drawn down. In its last three months, according to one millennium commissioner, increased numbers of visitors meant the dome broke even and never used those final funds that caused such volcanic public fury. The money is there, already given to the dome, and it should be used to help ensure the dome remains a public space. But the real endowment comes from the land around it, sold to create a trust for it in perpetuity.  Richard Rogers has an ambitious vision for the place and is likely to join better developers to propose a scheme for the North Greenwich peninsula that would be a model for the kind of regeneration his Urban Task Force advocates. It would include at least 40% affordable housing for the local community: he has been talking with Peabody and Rowntree about social housing possibilities. It would be a high density cityscape with shops and offices as well as homes, looking on to a leisure park around the dome that would be a national attraction for sports and concerts - run by PY or the BBC/Tussauds group, or any other entertainment consortium. He talks of things built in Barcelona and Amsterdam, and London's terrible past   mistakes. Last time I wrote about the dome, a fair number of emails from around the country complained bitterly at any more public time, money or attention being thrown at this London site. They have a point. It would have been better had the dome been built elsewhere. But there it is now in Greenwich, a national treasure on a site of natural beauty. Huge sums have been wasted, but that is no reason to waste the only good that can come from it.  Rogers points across the water to Canary Wharf, the great emblem of the Thatcher era - all offices, stylish restaurants and expensive houses, a pure property developers' hygienic, anodyne heaven straight from the brochure. It is an eerie place - no children, schools or old people, no workers, beggars, misfits, everything crisp and pricey for its cloned battalions of young professionals, with none of the eccentric, random oddity that breathes real   city life. Now imagine across the water a Labour era development in complete social contrast, a regeneration project as a model for other city schemes.  The question is: does this mark new thinking by Labour? In the early days, how avidly they sought to show they were as friendly to private developers as any conservative government. The tube is the next big question, as bargaining continues ferociously behind the scenes. Gordon Brown, jaw set, says the risk of major construction programmes must all be borne by private companies, despite passionate public opinion in favour of keeping it publicly owned. He ploughs on with the sale of air traffic control too, against the public will. But somewhere in the heart of government, the dome decision may herald the start of a welcome change of attitude for the second term."
1,"It is my good fortune to spend half my life in one of the Peak District's pedestrian villages. We boast neither a car park nor a historic church. So we are spared both bikers whiling away their afternoons by revving up their engines and motorists who think that they have done their duty to culture and the countryside by driving slowly past something that was built 500 years ago. People come to our village to walk. They come all year round - teenagers with huge backpacks and bedrolls, bare-kneed geriatrics supported by exotic walking sticks, and earnest students of limestone landscape with plastic-covered maps hanging upside down from lanyards round their necks. Today, spring bank holiday Monday, the hardy annuals will be joined by seasonal reinforcements: the casual walkers for whom our village has a special significance. They stop here to change their shoes.  Middle-aged ladies in twin-sets and pearls who travel together in sensible family saloons behave in exactly the same way as the courting couples in wire-wheeled sports cars who kiss before they disembark. They remove whatever is on their feet with the conscientious solemnity of a pious Muslim at the door of a mosque. There the comparison ends. For, rain or shine, they pull on expensive hiking boots in preparation for an afternoon or preprandial stroll in the best walking country in the world.  WH Auden wrote that what made limestone country special was its inclination to dissolve in water. That is only part of the story. Great faults run through the substrata of rock, and during the years before we began to calculate time, the earth split open. The result was towering escarpments, which we call ""edges"", and horizons that are always sharp and clear against the sky. When I walk my modest four miles in the early evening, I can see halfway to eternity.  The ruined barns and byres are relics of a dead civilisation as well as a more simple sort of farming. But farmers are rebuilding the dry-stone walls that have separated the fields since the enclosures. They are being recreated along exactly the lines that the rude forefathers of our hamlet accepted when their grazing rights were stolen, and they will be remade with the stones that built the original boundaries. Today's visitors will walk across living country built out of old England.  We take pride in the Peaks' unyielding landscape. But the visitors who change their shoes outside my house today will walk over hills and fields that have been made to look gentle by the colours of May. In the meadows that are   already mowed, pale earth shines through the paler green of the stubble. The fields where the grass still grows are speckled with buttercups, and behind them, at the foot of the hills, Queen Anne's lace and May blossom dapple the slopes with patches of dazzling white. Even the gorse at the crest of the escarpments has changed from violent yellow to modest amber. Rabbits in the hillsides sit in the entrances to their burrows like extras from Watership Down, and hares tiptoe to reconnoitre the land before racing away with the skip and jump that made our ancestors believe that they were mad.  The farmer who writes agricultural notes for our parish magazine caused some surprise by asking his neighbours to accept that the foot-and-mouth epidemic - which passed us by but forced us into quarantine - was not without its blessings. Wildlife that he had not seen since he was a boy returned to his land. His reaction was unusual. But what else would you expect from a citizen of Arcadia?   Let me not give the impression that there is no grief and sorrow here. Each spring morning, we have a daily sadness. Frogs, which have swum happily in one of the underground streams beneath my garden, squeeze their way through cracks in the wall above the lawn and luxuriate in the dew on the grass until the sun comes out. Then they dehydrate. Those which I cannot revive with a watering can wither into desiccated corpses that remind me of the dead in Pompeii. But next spring there will be frog spawn in the old horse trough by my garden gate.  And next spring bank holiday, the walkers will be back to change their shoes. They will park in front of my house, sit on my wall and occupy the undivided attention of my dog as he lies on his window seat. As I try to work nearby, he will draw my attention to each arrival. The years of our companionship have taught me to distinguish between his various messages - welcoming, warning or suggesting (in the politest possible way) that the visitors should move on. I tell him just to rejoice. They are there because we live in the best walking country in the world.","Last Tuesday morning, every national newspaper - including the Guardian - made the Soham murder trial its front-page lead.

0,"It is my good fortune to spend half my life in one of the Peak District's pedestrian villages. We boast neither a car park nor a historic church. So we are spared both bikers whiling away their afternoons by revving up their engines and motorists who think that they have done their duty to culture and the countryside by driving slowly past something that was built 500 years ago. People come to our village to walk. They come all year round - teenagers with huge backpacks and bedrolls, bare-kneed geriatrics supported by exotic walking sticks, and earnest students of limestone landscape with plastic-covered maps hanging upside down from lanyards round their necks. Today, spring bank holiday Monday, the hardy annuals will be joined by seasonal reinforcements: the casual walkers for whom our village has a special significance. They stop here to change their shoes.  Middle-aged ladies in twin-sets and pearls who travel together in sensible family saloons behave in exactly the same way as the courting couples in wire-wheeled sports cars who kiss before they disembark. They remove whatever is on their feet with the conscientious solemnity of a pious Muslim at the door of a mosque. There the comparison ends. For, rain or shine, they pull on expensive hiking boots in preparation for an afternoon or preprandial stroll in the best walking country in the world.  WH Auden wrote that what made limestone country special was its inclination to dissolve in water. That is only part of the story. Great faults run through the substrata of rock, and during the years before we began to calculate time, the earth split open. The result was towering escarpments, which we call ""edges"", and horizons that are always sharp and clear against the sky. When I walk my modest four miles in the early evening, I can see halfway to eternity.  The ruined barns and byres are relics of a dead civilisation as well as a more simple sort of farming. But farmers are rebuilding the dry-stone walls that have separated the fields since the enclosures. They are being recreated along exactly the lines that the rude forefathers of our hamlet accepted when their grazing rights were stolen, and they will be remade with the stones that built the original boundaries. Today's visitors will walk across living country built out of old England.  We take pride in the Peaks' unyielding landscape. But the visitors who change their shoes outside my house today will walk over hills and fields that have been made to look gentle by the colours of May. In the meadows that are   already mowed, pale earth shines through the paler green of the stubble. The fields where the grass still grows are speckled with buttercups, and behind them, at the foot of the hills, Queen Anne's lace and May blossom dapple the slopes with patches of dazzling white. Even the gorse at the crest of the escarpments has changed from violent yellow to modest amber. Rabbits in the hillsides sit in the entrances to their burrows like extras from Watership Down, and hares tiptoe to reconnoitre the land before racing away with the skip and jump that made our ancestors believe that they were mad.  The farmer who writes agricultural notes for our parish magazine caused some surprise by asking his neighbours to accept that the foot-and-mouth epidemic - which passed us by but forced us into quarantine - was not without its blessings. Wildlife that he had not seen since he was a boy returned to his land. His reaction was unusual. But what else would you expect from a citizen of Arcadia?   Let me not give the impression that there is no grief and sorrow here. Each spring morning, we have a daily sadness. Frogs, which have swum happily in one of the underground streams beneath my garden, squeeze their way through cracks in the wall above the lawn and luxuriate in the dew on the grass until the sun comes out. Then they dehydrate. Those which I cannot revive with a watering can wither into desiccated corpses that remind me of the dead in Pompeii. But next spring there will be frog spawn in the old horse trough by my garden gate.  And next spring bank holiday, the walkers will be back to change their shoes. They will park in front of my house, sit on my wall and occupy the undivided attention of my dog as he lies on his window seat. As I try to work nearby, he will draw my attention to each arrival. The years of our companionship have taught me to distinguish between his various messages - welcoming, warning or suggesting (in the politest possible way) that the visitors should move on. I tell him just to rejoice. They are there because we live in the best walking country in the world.","The most interesting aspect of France's BSE scandal is that it makes no sense at all. Britain stopped exporting contaminated cattle feed to Europe in 1991 (though we continued sending it to the third world until 1996). In most other EU countries cases have already peaked and declined, as expected. But in France, the number of infected animals has doubled in the last year. It is impossible to see how this pattern could result from the export of British bone meal. The simple fact is that the transmission of BSE has never been satisfactorily explained by the prevailing theory. The consumption of meat and bone meal from infected cows has doubtless had an important role to play. Yet this explanation alone fails to account for the huge numbers of cattle in Britain which continued to become infected after most contaminated feed had been removed from the food chain. The latest research on the human form of the disease, nvCJD, published three weeks ago, failed to find any link with the consumption of infected beef.  You might have imagined that when its theory isn't working, a government would wish to test the alternatives. But the British administration has, so far, sought only to attack a hypothesis which does appear to fit the facts. Since 1988, a Somerset farmer called Mark Purdey has been arguing that scientists have overlooked the root causes of BSE. Self-taught and self- financed, he has mastered the brain's complex biochemical pathways and this year published a groundbreaking paper in a respected medical journal. His reward is to have been reviled, misrepresented and physically attacked.  Prions, the brain proteins whose alteration seems to be responsible for BSE, are designed to protect the brain from the oxidising properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultra- violet light, Purdey argues. When, he suggests, the prion proteins are exposed to too little copper and too much manganese, the manganese takes the place of the copper the prion normally binds to. This means that the protein becomes distorted and loses its function.   BSE arose in British herds during the 1980s, Mark Purdey asserts, because the Ministry of Agriculture started forcing all cattle farmers to treat their animals with an organophosphate pesticide called phosmet, at far higher doses than are used elsewhere in the world. The pesticide had to be poured along the line of the spinal cord. Phosmet, Purdey has shown, captures copper. At the same time, cattle feed was being supplemented with chicken manure, from birds dosed with manganese to increase their egg yield. The prion proteins in the cows' brains were   both deprived of copper and dosed with manganese. In France, the use of phosmet first became mandatory in Brittany. Twenty of the country's initial 28 cases of BSE emerged there. BSE's subsequent spread, Purdey maintains, mirrors the use of the pesticide.  Poisoning by similar means may explain the distribution of the human form of the disease. Of the two main clusters in Britain one, in Kent, is in the middle of a fruit and hop growing area where huge quantities of both organophosphates and manganese-based fungicides are used. The other is in Queniborough in Leicestershire, whose dyeworks (until they caught fire a few years ago, spraying chemicals over the village) used to dump some of their residues into the sewage system, Purdey alleges. The sewage was spread over the fields. Dyeworks use shedloads of manganese.  Purdey has tested his theory on BSE and CJD clusters in Iceland, Colorado, Slovakia and Sardinia. He found that people and animals had been exposed to deficiencies of   copper and surfeits of manganese. Most of the clusters, intriguingly, are in mountainous areas, where levels of ultraviolet light are high. But the most compelling evidence in support of his hypothesis comes from a paper published by a team of biochemists at Cambridge this year. They found that when copper was substituted by manganese in prion proteins, the prions adopted precisely the distinguishing features which identify the infective agent in BSE.  If Purdey is right, he deserves a Nobel Prize for medicine. Instead he has been shot at, his phone lines have been cut and his house has been burnt down. The Ministry of Agriculture, which for 50 years has enjoyed a dangerously close relationship with the agrochemical industry, has repeatedly sought to discredit him. Suddenly, however, its tone has changed, and it has now promised to start funding his research. The families of the French victims of CJD are threatening to sue the British government, and it desperately needs an alternative transmission theory. With funding on its way, and new evidence accumulating every month, a self-educated Somerset dairy farmer could be about to overturn the entire body of scientific research on the biggest public health scandal of modern times."
1,"Last Tuesday morning, every national newspaper - including the Guardian - made the Soham murder trial its front-page lead. Some of the headlines were written in taut American colloquialisms, which, as well as saving space, convey an impression of dramatic urgency. The Manchester United replica shirts, in which Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman died, had been ""binned"". Ian Huntley, the principal defendant, ""took the stand"". The effect was so startling that, for a moment, it seemed irresponsible not to read what one tabloid called ""the chilling details"". Most of the stories were illustrated with two photographs. One was of the bath in which Holly Wells was said to have died. The other - reproduced in colour - showed, half-burned at the bottom of a school dustbin, the shirts in which the girls were last seen. I do not follow murder trails with the care that would make me an authority of their coverage by the press. But I cannot recall any recent prosecution being reported in such detail. And Tuesday was only one day in the continuing saga. In the next week, after the judge has summed up and the jury announced its verdict, we can expect the coverage to be augmented by an avalanche of comment.  Newspapers fill their front pages with stories that they judge will attract readers and increase circulation. So we are required to believe - as a result of last Tuesday's unanimous editorial verdict - that the British public, whatever its general taste in journalism, combines in its enthusiasm for information about human suffering. Accounts of Ian Huntley ""sobbing in court"", admitting responsibility for the two girls' deaths and expressing his bitter regret that he cannot ""turn back the clock"" to the time before they died, apparently sold newspapers. It seems that large sections of the great British public have an inexhaustible appetite for horror.  Newspapers have a duty to report the trial of Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr and the right to describe it in whatever way they choose. In a democracy, justice must be done in public. Newspapers often pretend that their penchant for sensation is essential to the national interest rather than to circulation. But, while we are entitled to deplore their hypocrisy, we should not complain too loudly about the run-of-the-mill revelation and routine expos. They have to sell copies to survive. That explains their readiness to supply the salacious details of murder, rape and assault cases once the stories can be legitimised as court reporting. But what about the demand? There is only one word with which to describe the desire for details of the   Soham tragedy. The word is prurience.  All decent people felt unmitigated horror when they heard the simple fact of the two girls' deaths. And no one who has not endured a similar trauma is fully able to imagine the depth of grief in which their parents must still be engulfed. The Chapmans and the Wellses deserve our unqualified sympathy. Absorption in the squalid details of Ian Huntley's behaviour is a strange way in which to show it. Reading his explanation of how he fitted the girls' bodies into the boot of his car is hardly an expression of condolence. The lawyers have to argue about his conduct. But there is something sick about the casual reader following him on that last tragic journey.  Poring over every detail of the evidence and cross-examination - ""Had you disturbed the clothing of either girl before they went into the ditch?"" - is not very different from standing outside the courthouse in the hope of catching a glimpse of the defendant through the window of the prison van or waiting at Tyburn to see the week's hangings. Last week,   the country was awash with sedentary voyeurism.  The vicarious emotions that the accounts of the trial provoked range from the honourable, through the ignoble to the thoroughly perverse. Sentimentalists will claim that by learning of the two girls' suffering they share the parents' grief and loss. Can they really believe that families bereaved by such tragedies want complete strangers to read the necessarily sordid arguments about their children's last hours? It has to happen in court. And the families have shown admirable courage in being there to see justice done. But they are unlikely to find much consolation in headlines such as ""I put the body in the ditch and rolled her down"".

Regrettably, we shall never know.","I have managed, with very little effort, to survive a year of two royal funerals and one golden jubilee without ever experiencing any of the emotions that the tabloid newspapers regarded as the mark of loyalty and patriotism. But today I feel a profound sympathy for the Princess Royal. Until yesterday, the mention of her name moved me only to resentment. I was at the Oval in 1950 when David Sheppard was so distracted by the public address system's, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have a little princess"", that either Ramadhin or Valentine (that year the two great West Indian spinners were interchangeable) bowled him next ball. But now Anne and I (suddenly the familiarity seems natural) are united by a passion greater even than that which I feel for cricket. Dogs. And not any old dogs. Dogs which get their owners into trouble. Legal trouble. The comparison is not exact. I was convicted under the Royal Parks Act when my Buster killed a goose. The Princess Royal remains innocent until she is proved guilty (under the Dangerous Dogs Act) of failing to prevent her Eglantyne from taking a nip at a lady who was walking in Windsor Great Park. And, as you would expect, Eglantyne is a pure English bull terrier while Buster, like me, is a mongrel. But one thing we undoubtedly have in common - our mothers' sympathy.  When my mother - then aged 93 - was telephoned by the Sun with the news of my disgrace, she suggested (in Buster's defence, not mine), ""It was probably a game that went wrong."" The Queen's view on these matters was revealed to me by Charles Anson, Her Majesty's official spokesman and once my private secretary in the Foreign Office. We met outside Buckingham Palace on the day that my case came to court and he assured me, ""Your sovereign is on your side. She prefers dogs to geese any day.""  I do not suggest that the Queen feels the same about the relationship between dogs and people - though, in her declining years, my mother constantly quoted Jeanne-Marie Roland, the French revolutionary: ""The more I see of men, the better I like dogs."" But the Queen does, I know, hold strong views about the Dangerous Dogs Act. She expressed them to me with great force and passion during the lunch that preceded the opening of the Birmingham International Convention Centre 10 years ago. I share her criticism of that silly legislation - introduced in a fit of panic by Kenneth Baker and supported by a craven House of Commons (me included). But it is important to keep its proposals in proportion.  The proportions of the Princess Royal's dogs do not put them in the category that the police are entitled arbitrarily to impound and the courts empowered to have destroyed - except in the most extreme circumstances.  Do not worry, Your Royal Highness. Eglantyne is safe. As Harold Wilson once told a rebellious Labour Party, ""Every dog is allowed one nip."" If they had any sense, the wounded Windsor walkers would agree and drop the charges.  I hope that the police were as courteous to the Princess Royal as they were to me. I was accosted with a great deal of unnecessary show - lights flashing and siren wailing as the patrol car followed me down the street. But afterwards they were supportive to the point of telling me that I should not let the thought of prosecution spoil my weekend. A warning would be the worst that would happen. (Six weeks later I read in the newspapers that the police had misjudged the director of public prosecutions' intention. When the crown prosecution service telephoned to apologise for not telling me first, they explained, ""There's been so much publicity, we couldn't do anything else."")  Assuming that, like me, the Princess Royal is not willing to be separated from her dogs, Her Royal Highness is going to find the press attention near unbearable. It was the simple idiocy of the photographers and reporters that drove me to fury. For days they followed Buster and me around in the hope that he would once again pull his lead out of my hand and find another goose to kill. When I suggested to them that, from then on, the price of Buster was eternal vigilance, they always smiled vacuously. I hope, as well as suspect, that Princess Anne will treat her tormentors more severely.  Of course, she will not go to court herself. A solicitor will appear on her behalf, as one appeared on mine. I pleaded guilty, though I did contest the prosecution's version of events. The incident had occurred while I was ""picking up"" - an activity involving plastic bags which is best not described in detail. As I bent down, Buster jerked the lead from my grasp and bounded off into the bushes at the Whitehall end of St James's Park. The police alleged that he was ""off the lead"". I insisted that we explained that Buster was never off the lead. I was. My solicitor calculated that my attempt at humour would cost me another hundred pounds.  Despite the anguish of the weeks between offence and conviction - every passing policeman was assumed to carry a death warrant in his pocket - we did well out of the affair. Buster's Diaries is the only bestseller we have ever had in our family. The Princess Royal will benefit too. A nation of dog lovers will remember Eglantyne's one nip and forget her mistress's many snarls."

Houses were boarded up to change voting patterns, false certificates were used to evade arms embargoes and palms were greased to help secure foreign contracts. Conservative corruption left such a broad tideline that it isn't easy to say where the highwater mark was. But many would choose a story which resulted in the most humiliating legal verdict any recent British government has faced: the Pergau dam scandal. The Tory administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Malaysia, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Aid and Trade Provision.  If, somehow, you managed to miss this drama, don't worry. The whole intriguing tale is now being repeated by a government near you. The Labour administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, has misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Turkey, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Export Credit Guarantee Department.  There is, however, one critical difference. The primary purpose of the Pergau dam, like that of most major construction, was to provide lucrative work for large companies. The Ilisu dam in Turkey will certainly fulfil this function. Like Pergau, it will also provide some electricity, though not, of course, as much as forecast. But the main purposes of the Turkish government's project are quite different. The first is to hold Syria and Iraq to ransom by controlling the flow of the river Tigris. The second is to assist its ethnic cleansing programme.  Hasankeyf, an ancient city, is one of the most important archaeological sites on earth; contin- uously inhabited for 10,000 years, it bears the remains of nine distinct civilisations. The Kurds regard the city as their cultural heartland. Turkey sees it as an emblem of resistance. When Hasankeyf and surrounding settlements are drowned by the dam, some 20,000 Kurds will be forced from their homes and moved into model villages in which they can be monitored and controlled. Our government, which went to war in the spring to stop ethnic cleansing, is, in the winter, underwriting it.  It is not hard to see why. European leaders have just agreed that Turkey can join the union: one result will be valuable contracts for British companies if the government   can forge strong commercial links with the Turkish administration. British companies see the country's defence sector as a massive potential market.  The Labour government's involvement in the Ilisu dam may be the biggest corruption scandal in western Europe, but you could be forgiven for having missed it. The decision was, it seems, to have been announced on Christmas Eve, but when the Hamilton verdict broke, the government seized its chance. The headline on the press release it distributed indicated only that Stephen Byers, the secretary of state for trade and industry, had released reports about the dam. Only halfway down the press release was notice given that Mr Byers was ""minded to grant"" the project government backing. A story which should have been at the top of the bulletins was either missed or excluded altogether. The Labour government, in other words, has successfully hidden its own corruption behind a tale of Tory sleaze.  The reports on which the   government's decision is supposed to have been based provide a compelling case for taking precisely the opposite course. They show that most local people object to the dam, that no provisions have been made for adequate compensation, that the project has been attended by an information black-out, that it threatens fish species found only in the Tigris, and could poison the water downstream. The ""consultation"" and ""informed consent"" the reports insist must take place before the project goes ahead are a sick joke in a region in which dissent is ruthlessly crushed and people are imprisoned and tortured simply for speaking their own language. As the Kurdish Human Rights Project has documented, 19 villages in the area due to be flooded have already been evicted at gunpoint and destroyed. Instead of insisting that human rights are respected and the environment is defended, the British government is relying on assurances from the Turkish authorities, which are about as dependable as Neil Hamilton's memory.  Silenced by Turkey's repression, the Kurds are a half- forgotten, disposable people. Our government has wrapped them up and handed them over to big business. Christmas presents seldom come so generous."

A nation of dog lovers will remember Eglantyne's one nip and forget her mistress's many snarls.","If, as the Queen tells us, ""there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge"", how does she know about them? The answer to that conundrum is that there is no answer. Nothing about the monarchy is rational. We inhabit a Ruritanian fantasy in which the parliamentary year begins with the monarch - magnificent at mid-morning in evening dress and tiara - reading the details of the government's legislative programme from a piece of hand-inscribed vellum.  That is the dull routine of royal family life. From time to time it erupts into a demonstration that the notion on which it is built is inherently dangerous as well as absurd. The amount of time and space which has been wasted on a butler who became obsessed with his employer is the direct result of the fiction that there is something special about the royal family. That is only true if, by special, we mean strange. The squalid absurdity of the latest revelations is illustrated by a growing feeling of sympathy for Mohamed Al Fayed. The man who is adjudged unworthy of a British passport must deeply regret that his son became associated with such a disreputable bunch.  Writing about the royal family's foibles is, for me, a novelty. Ten days ago, I was about to resign from the Campaign for an Elected Head of State because of its attitude towards the Windsors' private lives, as revealed in the Panorama investigation of Camilla Parker Bowles's prospects of becoming queen. The simulated meeting of the campaign's committee showed an intolerably cynical approach to the business of promoting a republic. Professor Stephen Haseler, the chairman, announced that the personal conduct of the Prince of Wales must be exploited in the drive to end the hereditary monarchy.  My arguments in favour of an elected head of state have always been built around the inadequacy of the institution, not the shortcomings of the individuals. Of course, I accepted that the heredity principle is based on the notion of a genetically distinct family, with everything that family does - in private as well as public - providing evidence of its suitability to rule.  But I was against the monarchy because it embodied the idea of a social hierarchy and encouraged the nation to look back instead of forward, not because the heir to the throne made childishly prurient telephone calls.  I was wrong. The real objection to a monarchy remains the debilitating effect it has upon society. But the damage done by its public existence is compounded by the private conduct of the monarch and her relations. The Queen's role in the Paul Burrell case makes that clear. It is impossible to believe that Her Majesty only realised the significance of her three-hour meeting with Burrell a couple of days before he was to give evidence in his trial for theft. Her personal conduct was clearly influenced by belief in the constitutional fiction on which her status rests. In private as well as public, she was above the law.  Her first instinct - as mother and sovereign - was to preserve the good name of her (royal) family. Initially, that seemed best achieved by keeping well out of the Burrell affair. She only intervened when abdication (in this limited sense) seemed unlikely to prevent revelations about the home life of our dear Princess of Wales.  The intervention hopelessly failed. But that does not reduce its significance. The personal conduct of the royal family, Diana's estrangement from the Prince of Wales, and her weird relationship with staff, combined with her mother-in-law's determination to protect the Windsors' reputation to produce a legal travesty. In the case of Regina versus Burrell,   the defendant was alleged to have stolen property from Regina's daughter-in-law. Then Regina herself became the star witness.  While the monarchy exists, the deference afforded to them will continue to prejudice everything they touch. As long as the reverence was simply extended to the Duke of York being escorted to the Ministry of Defence each day by motorcycle policemen, no great harm was done. The conduct of the Burrell investigation shows the monarchy is not just a bad joke.  Detectives from a squad that specialised in dealing with celebrities - an arrangement which itself says something about society - knew, or ought to have known, that Burrell had claimed to have spoken of his acquisitions during a royal audience. Yet none of them thought it appropriate to check his claim with the Queen. At best, they were overawed at the thought of cross-examining Her Majesty. Some of them may even have imagined that she was beyond their jurisdiction. Either way, justice might well have been denied because of their obsequiousness. The problems of the hereditary monarchy result from its existence. The only solution to any of the consequent absurdities is a republic."
0,"I have managed, with very little effort, to survive a year of two royal funerals and one golden jubilee without ever experiencing any of the emotions that the tabloid newspapers regarded as the mark of loyalty and patriotism. But today I feel a profound sympathy for the Princess Royal. Until yesterday, the mention of her name moved me only to resentment. I was at the Oval in 1950 when David Sheppard was so distracted by the public address system's, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have a little princess"", that either Ramadhin or Valentine (that year the two great West Indian spinners were interchangeable) bowled him next ball. But now Anne and I (suddenly the familiarity seems natural) are united by a passion greater even than that which I feel for cricket. Dogs. And not any old dogs. Dogs which get their owners into trouble. Legal trouble. The comparison is not exact. I was convicted under the Royal Parks Act when my Buster killed a goose. The Princess Royal remains innocent until she is proved guilty (under the Dangerous Dogs Act) of failing to prevent her Eglantyne from taking a nip at a lady who was walking in Windsor Great Park. And, as you would expect, Eglantyne is a pure English bull terrier while Buster, like me, is a mongrel. But one thing we undoubtedly have in common - our mothers' sympathy.  When my mother - then aged 93 - was telephoned by the Sun with the news of my disgrace, she suggested (in Buster's defence, not mine), ""It was probably a game that went wrong."" The Queen's view on these matters was revealed to me by Charles Anson, Her Majesty's official spokesman and once my private secretary in the Foreign Office. We met outside Buckingham Palace on the day that my case came to court and he assured me, ""Your sovereign is on your side. She prefers dogs to geese any day.""  I do not suggest that the Queen feels the same about the relationship between dogs and people - though, in her declining years, my mother constantly quoted Jeanne-Marie Roland, the French revolutionary: ""The more I see of men, the better I like dogs."" But the Queen does, I know, hold strong views about the Dangerous Dogs Act. She expressed them to me with great force and passion during the lunch that preceded the opening of the Birmingham International Convention Centre 10 years ago. I share her criticism of that silly legislation - introduced in a fit of panic by Kenneth Baker and supported by a craven House of Commons (me included). But it is important to keep its proposals in proportion.  The proportions of the Princess Royal's dogs do not put them in the category that the police are entitled arbitrarily to impound and the courts empowered to have destroyed - except in the most extreme circumstances.  Do not worry, Your Royal Highness. Eglantyne is safe. As Harold Wilson once told a rebellious Labour Party, ""Every dog is allowed one nip."" If they had any sense, the wounded Windsor walkers would agree and drop the charges.  I hope that the police were as courteous to the Princess Royal as they were to me. I was accosted with a great deal of unnecessary show - lights flashing and siren wailing as the patrol car followed me down the street. But afterwards they were supportive to the point of telling me that I should not let the thought of prosecution spoil my weekend. A warning would be the worst that would happen. (Six weeks later I read in the newspapers that the police had misjudged the director of public prosecutions' intention. When the crown prosecution service telephoned to apologise for not telling me first, they explained, ""There's been so much publicity, we couldn't do anything else."")  Assuming that, like me, the Princess Royal is not willing to be separated from her dogs, Her Royal Highness is going to find the press attention near unbearable. It was the simple idiocy of the photographers and reporters that drove me to fury. For days they followed Buster and me around in the hope that he would once again pull his lead out of my hand and find another goose to kill. When I suggested to them that, from then on, the price of Buster was eternal vigilance, they always smiled vacuously. I hope, as well as suspect, that Princess Anne will treat her tormentors more severely.  Of course, she will not go to court herself. A solicitor will appear on her behalf, as one appeared on mine. I pleaded guilty, though I did contest the prosecution's version of events. The incident had occurred while I was ""picking up"" - an activity involving plastic bags which is best not described in detail. As I bent down, Buster jerked the lead from my grasp and bounded off into the bushes at the Whitehall end of St James's Park. The police alleged that he was ""off the lead"". I insisted that we explained that Buster was never off the lead. I was. My solicitor calculated that my attempt at humour would cost me another hundred pounds.  Despite the anguish of the weeks between offence and conviction - every passing policeman was assumed to carry a death warrant in his pocket - we did well out of the affair. Buster's Diaries is the only bestseller we have ever had in our family. The Princess Royal will benefit too. A nation of dog lovers will remember Eglantyne's one nip and forget her mistress's many snarls.","The symbol of this Christmas is the noose. Hang my son, says Ian Huntley's mother. Hang Saddam, says almost everyone. The gallows is not an option for Maxine Carr, who is due out of jail next May. The relatively minor nature of her sin, a crime of lies and silence, has not prevented Maxine-haters placing her in a continuum of female she-devils stretching from Medea to Myra. As the great Judaeo-Christian feast approaches, the polarity between good and evil is stark. In modern replays of the Book of Genesis, conducted in settings as diverse as the Old Bailey, a spider hole near Tikrit and your local Odeon, light does not often vanquish darkness. For happy endings, try Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy at the National Theatre or Tolkien's Return of the King.  In real life, evil prevails. Despite George W. Bush's masterclasses on the subject, there is no particular hierarchy of monsterdom. Michael Jackson, facing child sex-abuse charges, may get a politer welcome on his planned visit to the UK than the one extended to the God-fearing President of the United States. Nor is there an obvious logic to the way we treat untouchables.  Saddam's capture inspired a desire for vengeance, certainly, but also an uneasy pity. The dead eyes and prophet's beard drove commentators to plunder the Old and New Testaments as thoroughly as Bush's speechwriters in an effort to discover what their unexpected sympathy represented. The non-religious answer is what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil.  Tyrants and murderers are defined not only by evidence of their actions - in Saddam's case, the toll of Kurdish citizens gassed and of skulls scratched up from mass graves - but by a cruelty of the imagination. Myths of how maniacal despots behave sit uneasily with Saddam's domestic inventory: one can of 7 Up, a bottle of Lacoste Pour Homme cologne, minted toothpicks, Maxwell House coffee and a picture inscribed 'God Bless Our Home'.  The humdrum detail that jars the observer out of unadulterated hatred also operated in the case of Ian Huntley. His conviction for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman was a restrained affair, free of mobs storming the courtroom precinct or screaming 'Kill Him', in an echo of Tyburn. There was little sign of the bloodlust that followed the Moors Murders and the sentencing of James Bulger's killers. Yet few murders have transfixed Britain, and the world, like those of Holly and Jessica.  Their deaths fed a fear corroding society. If two little girls in smalltown England could be lured to their deaths by a trusted neighbour, then no son or daughter is safe. But more than one child is slaughtered every week by a parent and no one notices. Skewed notions of risk are driven by rare crimes and normally articulated in mob venom.  One reason for a more subdued response might be the dignity of the Chapman and the Wells families, who forbore to demand vengeance. In addition, people do not know, and perhaps never will, exactly how the children died. But those facts do not explain why Huntley has escaped bestial status. I asked a hairdresser friend who has been canvassing her clients. 'It's because he looks so normal,' they told her.  Presentability served Huntley well. His convincing manner persuaded underage girls to have sex with him and prosecutors to ignore their cries of rape. The post-trial furore has been directed at police error in logging past complaints against him, but this is not primarily a scandal of bad filing. The lack of heed paid to his record reflects a society that extended more credence and legal rights to plausible men than to abused girls. Even now, if a case is to succeed, prosecutors prefer their victims dead.  The authorities and the public want child molesters to look like proper perverts, in the mould of a snaggle-toothed Roy Whiting, Sarah Payne's murderer, who appeared in the Sun last week under the headline 'Grinning Creature'. Resembling Jack Nicholson in the latter stages of The Shining saves confusion. Irrespective of bureaucratic bungling by police, Whiting was never school caretaker material. He is separate, a monstrous other who, unlike Huntley or Saddam, holds no Caliban's mirror up to the virtuous world. Pious people, along with neglectful officials and prurient newspapers, need not worry about the thin dividing line between the demon and the normal citizen.  Since the Soham trial lacked a monster from central casting, Maxine Carr gets the role. A fellow prisoner has thrown boiling water at her, and the media hold her guilty of murder by proxy. On the night of the killings, Carr was at a party. The outing might, her critics claim, have pushed a jealous Huntley over the brink. 'Kiss of death' screamed the headline over a picture of her embracing a fellow reveller.  That snapshot in a Grimsby disco placed Carr in a pantheon of female monsters, ranging from the Harpies and the Sirens of Greek legend to Rose West. In myth and in distorted reality, women, deadlier than the male, occupy a spectrum between psychopathy and culpability for engineering family breakdown and producing delinquent children. Carr, branded the 'new Myra' and the catalysing agent of evil, was actually a liar whose mistake was to shack up with a murderer.  In being duped by Huntley's charm, she resembled the police, the school staff, the community and the two trusting girls he murdered. She behaved as others might, and for that reminder of our fallibility, more than her mendacity, she can never be forgiven. In a universe where religious language and political discourse collide, Carr is banished forever from the civilised world to reside with the ranks of the dark forces. Their quarters are becoming more cramped than Saddam's bunker.  The expanding army of darkness encompasses murderers and their gullible girlfriends, along with leaders of Iran and North Korea, the shapeless prosecutors of terror and the suspects interned without charge at Guantanamo and Belmarsh. Arbitrary polarities of good and evil, patented by politicians, mesh with a vengefulness in public thinking.  The capital punishment debate stirs again. Huntley should be executed, according to the string-'em-up lobby whose ambitions will never be heeded by any mainstream political party. Hanging Saddam, however, is deemed perfectly acceptable in Downing Street and the impeccably liberal leader columns of the Independent.  Merciful democrats cannot have it both ways. Certainly, Saddam should be tried in Iraq, but for Britain to rubber-stamp a death sentence would be disgraceful buck-passing by an occupying power which must now stand by its principles. Either we support what David Blunkett calls 'judicial murder' or we recognise that the first test of a humane society is the way it treats the most hideous.  Saddam, like Huntley, should spend his life in prison. There they can suffer for their crimes while offering an enduring reminder to those who once armed a tyrant and failed to stop a potential murderer. Denouncing evil is easy. How much harder to recognise that monsters, with their French cologne and high street clothes, not only share our tastes. Good societies must also shoulder some fragment of their guilt."
1,"Republicans are, or ought to be, against the monarchy on principle. The extravagant lifestyle of the royal family and the louche behaviour of wastrel princelings prejudice the public against the House of Windsor. But the only important argument concerns blood and birth. It is neither right nor reasonable that, at the beginning of the 21st century, heredity should determine who becomes the head of state. Elizabeth the Circumspect is as much an anachronism as her uncle Edward the Irresponsible would be today. There was a time when monarchists held the mirror image of that view. The case for the crown was, they insisted, unrelated to the character and conduct of the king or queen or the cost of the court. We used to be told that the monarch herself believed that she was the Lord's Anointed and that, orb and sceptre in hand, she had accepted God's invitation long to reign over us. A queen who imagines that she is personally ordained by the Almighty does not bother about the cost of an occasional journey by royal train.  If the Queen still holds that view - rather than the suspicion that she occupies the throne on sufferance - she should tell Alan Reid, the keeper of the privy purse, about it. When the cost of the royal household was revealed last week, he defended an annual expenditure of more than £36m in language that would have been entirely appropriate to a Subaru salesman confronting a sceptical customer.  ""We believe this represents a value-for-money monarchy. We are not looking to provide the cheapest monarchy. We are looking at one of good value and good quality."" Delete ""monarchy"", insert ""motorcar"" and the explanation could easily have been expressed on the forecourt of a suburban showroom. If this is the case for the monarchy, we are entitled to ask how many miles there are on the Queen's clock and if she is still in full working order.   It is easy to argue that an expenditure of £3m a month does not amount to a ""cost-effective"" head of state. An elected president - without a family to support in the manner to which the Duke of York has grown accustomed - would certainly cost less. But the important aspect of the dubious claim is its lese-majesty, not its accuracy. Once the monarchy feels it necessary to justify its existence in prosaic terms, the argument for monarchy collapses.  The superstition, on which the theory of hereditary succession is based, insists that the royal family is different from the rest of us. No sensible person argues that the Prince of Wales should ascend to the throne because he is an expert onarchitecture, education or   any of the other subjects about which he pontificates. Indeed, it is usually accepted that his opinions are embarrassingly silly. They are reprinted for exactly the same reason that it is assumed that one day he will be king. He is said to have inherent qualities that set him apart from his future subjects. It is that, not his financial prudence, which make him heir apparent.  Walter Bagehot claimed that the strength of the British monarchy lay in its ability to inspire ""the feelings by which heroic kings governed their rude age"" and, at the same time, experience ""the feelings by which the constitutions of later Greece ruled in more refined ages"". Neither of those lofty attributes encompassed the desperate desire to win the support of tabloid newspapers. Quite the opposite. Yet last week that aspiration was taken to risible extremes.  The ghost of Queen Victoria will find it difficult to believe that, after the cost of the court was published, Buckingham Palace issued a   detailed breakdown of the consumption patterns at royal garden parties. The £500,000 a year that the Queen spends on these occasions is, apparently, partly due to the gluttony of the guests - each of whom, on average, consumes 14 buns, bridge rolls and ice creams. A spokesman, demonstrating a grasp of arithmetic that is beyond question, pointed out that if the average is 14, some people ate even more. One of the ways of cutting the royal budget is, as Marie Antoinette failed to recognise, ""let them eat less cake"".  Even today, a monarchy can survive being hated or despised. But being the object of ridicule is lethal. However, our laughter ought to be moderated by compassion. The royal family faces an intolerable choice. Were the Queen to say - as Queen Victoria would have said - that the royal accounts were none of the common people's business, she would be excoriated for her arrogance. Yet, when she allowed her courtiers to justify the way in which she spends her money, the myth of monarchy is destroyed.  It is impossible to have a monarchy that is simultaneously regal and human. Pity their dilemma. And remember that a monarchy which is patronised with pity must, in the long run, be doomed.","If, as the Queen tells us, ""there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge"", how does she know about them? The answer to that conundrum is that there is no answer. Nothing about the monarchy is rational. We inhabit a Ruritanian fantasy in which the parliamentary year begins with the monarch - magnificent at mid-morning in evening dress and tiara - reading the details of the government's legislative programme from a piece of hand-inscribed vellum.  That is the dull routine of royal family life. From time to time it erupts into a demonstration that the notion on which it is built is inherently dangerous as well as absurd. The amount of time and space which has been wasted on a butler who became obsessed with his employer is the direct result of the fiction that there is something special about the royal family. That is only true if, by special, we mean strange. The squalid absurdity of the latest revelations is illustrated by a growing feeling of sympathy for Mohamed Al Fayed. The man who is adjudged unworthy of a British passport must deeply regret that his son became associated with such a disreputable bunch.  Writing about the royal family's foibles is, for me, a novelty. Ten days ago, I was about to resign from the Campaign for an Elected Head of State because of its attitude towards the Windsors' private lives, as revealed in the Panorama investigation of Camilla Parker Bowles's prospects of becoming queen. The simulated meeting of the campaign's committee showed an intolerably cynical approach to the business of promoting a republic. Professor Stephen Haseler, the chairman, announced that the personal conduct of the Prince of Wales must be exploited in the drive to end the hereditary monarchy.  My arguments in favour of an elected head of state have always been built around the inadequacy of the institution, not the shortcomings of the individuals. Of course, I accepted that the heredity principle is based on the notion of a genetically distinct family, with everything that family does - in private as well as public - providing evidence of its suitability to rule.  But I was against the monarchy because it embodied the idea of a social hierarchy and encouraged the nation to look back instead of forward, not because the heir to the throne made childishly prurient telephone calls.  I was wrong. The real objection to a monarchy remains the debilitating effect it has upon society.

""So just what is wrong with the Prince of Wales,"" probed Richard Kay. Well, it's pretty obvious isn't it? He's gone mad. Or worse. ""Friends ... are increasingly concerned about his wellbeing."" Which sounds as if the prince has joined Les Dennis, Winona Ryder, Michael Barrymore and Jeffrey Archer, all of whom have been reported, at various times, to be on ""suicide watch"". If only it were so easy! In jail, where the term originated, suicidal inmates can be checked every hour or more, through a handy peephole. But distressed celebrities are scattered all over the place, often behind closed doors, and quite impossible for their carers in the press to keep tabs on. The safest solution, surely, would be for Lord Rothermere or one of his competitors to establish a sort of celebrity Bedlam adjacent to their newsrooms into which these tragic individuals could be committed for their own good. With the stars monitored 24 hours a day by staff reporters and media mental health experts such as Raj Persaud, we could rest assured that everything was being done to stand between our favourite celebrities and their besetting problems with depression and alcoholism, shop-lifting and overweight and - perhaps saddest of all - crockery."
1,"On Sunday we had an evening of rum, sodomy and the lash. Last night it was followed by amputations without anaesthetic and gutters running with blood. Quite a bank holiday weekend. Certainly nobody can accuse Channel 4 of offering an airbrushed version of the Nelson bicentenary in its schedules this week.But Channel 4 is not alone in its preoccupation. The bookshops are groaning with new volumes on Trafalgar. Interest in the Royal Navy of Nelson's - and Jack Aubrey's - day is as strong as ever. The drumbeat of commemorative events is already difficult to ignore as October 21 nears. All of which provokes a large question: what, if anything, should we be celebrating on the 200th anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar?To many, of course, the answer is so self-evident as not to be worth further thought: Nelson was simply the brave and innovative commander whose death in a decisive battle against an aggressive enemy cemented his place as the emblematic British national hero. Merely to ask such a question is to run the risk of suspicion and derision in some quarters.Yet it is precisely because Nelson and Trafalgar are so iconic that it is worth examining them anew, in the light of modern needs. Nelson's war-torn Europe may seem light years from the peaceful, cooperative Europe of the 21st century - but Nelson is still the man carved in stone on top of our most famous national monument. Few of us are wholly resistant to his magic. Channel 4's coverage understands these complexities. And as Andrew Lambert, one of his best recent biographers, puts it: ""Whatever it means to be British in the 21st century, Nelson is part of that identity.""If that is right, which it is, then we need, as individuals and as a nation, to have a view about Nelson - and we need to know why we have that view. His story is more, much more, than a national heritage costume drama. We need to rise to the challenge of saying whether, how and why he fits into Britain today.This is not to belittle an indisputably remarkable man, whose death triggered almost unanimous national mourning and pride. Whatever else one can say about Nelson, he was a man who both lived up to his billing and who, in a very modern way, created it too. Remember, he was the national hero - title and all - in life before Trafalgar as well as in death afterwards. Death just made it more so.Nor is it to encourage those who want to judge him by our own standards rather than those of his own time. Nervertheless, an entirely proper historical argument against the celebration of Trafalgar is that the wrong side won. Nelson, after all, was waging war not just in defence of Britain, but in defence of reactionary and royalist Europe against not just France, but the democratic and republican ideals of the French revolution too.So would it have been such a terrible thing if Napoleon's planned invasion of Britain had taken place? More than a decade after Trafalgar, the fallen emperor explained to his doctor on St Helena what he had in mind in the summer of 1805.""I would have hastened over my flotilla with 200,000 men, landed as near Chatham as possible and proceeded direct to London, where I calculated to arrive in four days from the time of my landing. I would have proclaimed a republic and the abolition of the nobility and the house of peers, the distribution of the property of such of the latter as opposed me among my partisans, liberty, equality and the sovereignty of the people.""Bring it on, some will be tempted to say. Except that we would not have been offered the second half of Napoleon's scenario without the first. The reform would have been established, but it would only have been achieved at the point of a French bayonet. It was a package deal. And if there is one thing that the emperor actually achieved in the many countries on which he briefly imposed republican constitutions, it was to mobilise those countries to get rid of him so that they could govern themselves as free, rather than subject, peoples.A more historically accurate objection is that Trafalgar was not the victory we like to imagine. No, this is not some smart revisionist way of claiming that the French and Spanish actually won a battle they lost. But it is to say that Trafalgar was a victory in a different war to the one in the myth.It is at best arguable that Trafalgar saved Britain from invasion. In fact, Napoleon had turned his armies eastwards, against Austria and Russia, well before Nelson's finest hour. Decisive though it was, Trafalgar did little to alter the course of the Napoleonic wars. But it did mark the climax of the long-running 18th-century battle between Britain and France for global naval supremacy - what some have called the true first world war. ""The major long-term strategic consequence of the battle was that Britain possessed an unchallenged supremacy on the seas for the best part of a century,"" write Tim Clayton and Phil Craig in their book on Trafalgar.So that makes Nelson not the man who saved the nation but the man who made the British empire possible - not a comfortable thought for many, and not intended to be. Except that here too there are subtle issues. Napoleon may have presented himself as a warrior on behalf of 18th-century Enlightenment values, albeit in an increasingly perverted form. But Nelson, like the Royal Navy of his day, was a child of the Enlightenment as well. Nelson's navy would never have been the success that it was without a belief both in science and in treating people well. Nelson's leadership was based, Lambert argues, ""on love, not authority"". And certainly, if there was one thing that everyone agrees about Nelson, it is that his officers and men - black as well as white - thought he was the embodiment of great leadership. It has gone down in history as ""the Nelson touch"".In the end we return to Nelson not because what he represents is easy to accept, but because what he represents is hard to accept; not just because he knew how to command but because he knew how to command in a fight. There is no getting away from it. Nelson was a war leader, not a business leader. His true greatness lay in the clarity with which he persuaded people to follow him into highly aggressive actions that went beyond the limit of what they thought possible - and then, when on their own, to continue to act consistently with the spirit of his plans. Today we would call it empowerment. But Trafalgar is the classic example of that.Two hundred years ago this week, as he spent his last days ashore, Nelson repeatedly spoke of achieving an ""annihilating"" victory over France. It is a terrible word. But at Trafalgar he made the word a reality. It has to be faced that this is where Nelson's genius lay. Very occasionally it is necessary to do dreadful things. When it is they need doing brilliantly. That was what Nelson achieved, above all others in this country's history. For some it makes him a criminal. For the rest it makes him a hero. Sometimes the line between the two is a fine one.","Every year in this country, several hundred people are murdered. Of the hundreds, only a minority are ever widely reported. Of the minority, only a handful imprint themselves upon the psyche of a nation. And of the handful, only one or two in a decade become so infamous that they become the emblematic murders of their era. The killing of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by Ian Huntley in the village of Soham is one of those cases. No murder investigation has ever been more lavishly reported. No murder victims have ever acquired the iconic status of Holly and Jessica in their Beckham shirts. (Would the crime have captured the nation if they had been Norwich City fans?) Few murder trials have dominated the news for so long as the one that ended at the Old Bailey yesterday.  Ian Huntley has now been instantly consigned to a very select national pandemonium of the nation's most loathed killers. Some of his more recent fellow inmates include Fred and Rose West, Dennis Nilsen, Peter Sutcliffe, Harry Roberts, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. More distant denizens include Dr Harvey Crippen, Jack the Ripper and William Corder of Red Barn fame.  Like them, Huntley will now become a byword for evil and Soham a place like Cranley Gardens and Saddleworth moor, remembered for one awful thing alone. Already last night, the broadcasting schedules were cleared for extended special reports, a rare and revealing tribute to the case. Books will now be hastily written about Huntley's crimes. Official inquiries will be held into how such a man could do such things. In time, criminologists, cultural commentators, novelists and film-makers will all rake over the case in their own ways.  Though the trend in murder is upwards, it remains a very rare crime. Holly and Jessica were two of the total of 1,048 homicides in 2002-03 in England and Wales (the figure has been greatly inflated by the work of Dr Harold Shipman). Their chance of being a murder victim - like yours and mine - was around one in 60,000. Yet murder is obviously also the gravest of all crimes, one of the only serious offences to carry a mandatory sentence. For all their rarity, that select group of emblematic murders has always reflected something special about the dangers, fears and myths of the society in which they took place.  In his 1946 essay on the decline of the English murder, George Orwell reflected on the characteristics of the killings that, then as now, filled the pages of the News of the World. The English murderer, Orwell wrote, would normally be a ""little man of the professional class"", living a respectable and conformist life in the suburbs. He would ""go astray"" through cherishing a passion for his secretary or another man's wife. He would bring himself to the point of murder only after great wrestling with his conscience. Having determined on murder, he then planned   the crime - normally a poisoning - with the utmost cunning, only to be undone by some small unforeseen error. Such dramas, Orwell concluded, proved irresistible to the readers of middle Britain because they were the ""product of a stable society where the all-prevailing hypocrisy did at least ensure that crimes as serious as murder should have strong emotions behind them"".  Nearly 60 years after Orwell, we are still mesmerised by murder. But the characteristics of the emblematic murder of today are very different from those noted by Orwell. This is strikingly true of the Soham murders, which were committed by a minor public official rather than a professional person, apparently answering to his sexual demons not a cherished passion, and carried out seemingly on the spur of the moment rather than after great planning. If the distinguishing feature of the emblematic murder of the past was its careful premeditation, the equivalent feature of today's is its randomness and its opportunism.  This is why the unprecedented intensity of the coverage of the case is so important. Roy Hattersley rightly observed last week that there has never been anything like it. Day after day the case has dominated the airwaves and the front pages. For sheer volume Soham has eclipsed anything generated by the Wests or even by the murder of the toddler James Bulger, never mind the Moors murders or even the penny dreadfuls long ago.  The volume of coverage has been matched only by its often provocative stridency, especially in the weeks that followed the arrests of Huntley and Maxine Carr. This led the attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, to tell journalists last month that ""at times some of the reporting of the investigation and trial has been quite frankly unacceptable"". It was hardly surprising that Carr was taunted in Holloway before the trial as a second Myra Hindley. Carr was manifestly no such thing, but the tabloid depictions of her in the autumn of 2002 left no doubt that, for some newspaper editors and their readers, Carr now filled the post of national female demon left vacant by Hindley's death.  With every possible due respect to the murdered girls and their families, it has to be aggressively stated that the coverage of this case has been wholly out of proportion to its implied meaning. The subtext of the case is that your daughters are at risk of being murdered if they go out alone, even in a quiet East Anglian village, never mind on the mean streets of the inner city. Yet this is scarcely more true today than it has ever been.   Holly and Jessica, both aged 10, fell into the category of the population - girls aged between five and 16 - that is least likely of all of us to be the victims of murder. When young people are murdered, which after the age of 12 months they rarely are, by far the chief threat to them comes from their parents, then by other adults known to them (as Huntley was), but not from strangers. Boys, moreover, are more likely to be murdered than girls.  ""It was the powder keg waiting for the match. I was the match,"" Dennis Nilsen wrote about his own murder spree 20 years ago, implying that someone like himself lurks around every corner of every street. Some will say the same about Huntley's opportunist killings too. The persistent implication is that something like this can happen to anyone, any time, anywhere.  But the reality is that it can't and doesn't. Huntley's was an exceptionally awful crime, but it was also exceptionally unusual. It has been invested with national meaning less because of the crime than because of the way it has been reported. Under pressure from 24-hour news TV channels and the tabloids, the mainstream TV channels and what were then all still broadsheets bowed before the storm. The episode certainly tells us something about the kind of society we have become, but the truth is that it tells us rather more about the decline of the English media than it does about the decline of the English murder.    <BR>"
0,"On Sunday we had an evening of rum, sodomy and the lash. Last night it was followed by amputations without anaesthetic and gutters running with blood. Quite a bank holiday weekend. Certainly nobody can accuse Channel 4 of offering an airbrushed version of the Nelson bicentenary in its schedules this week.But Channel 4 is not alone in its preoccupation. The bookshops are groaning with new volumes on Trafalgar. Interest in the Royal Navy of Nelson's - and Jack Aubrey's - day is as strong as ever. The drumbeat of commemorative events is already difficult to ignore as October 21 nears. All of which provokes a large question: what, if anything, should we be celebrating on the 200th anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar?To many, of course, the answer is so self-evident as not to be worth further thought: Nelson was simply the brave and innovative commander whose death in a decisive battle against an aggressive enemy cemented his place as the emblematic British national hero. Merely to ask such a question is to run the risk of suspicion and derision in some quarters.Yet it is precisely because Nelson and Trafalgar are so iconic that it is worth examining them anew, in the light of modern needs. Nelson's war-torn Europe may seem light years from the peaceful, cooperative Europe of the 21st century - but Nelson is still the man carved in stone on top of our most famous national monument. Few of us are wholly resistant to his magic. Channel 4's coverage understands these complexities. And as Andrew Lambert, one of his best recent biographers, puts it: ""Whatever it means to be British in the 21st century, Nelson is part of that identity.""If that is right, which it is, then we need, as individuals and as a nation, to have a view about Nelson - and we need to know why we have that view. His story is more, much more, than a national heritage costume drama. We need to rise to the challenge of saying whether, how and why he fits into Britain today.This is not to belittle an indisputably remarkable man, whose death triggered almost unanimous national mourning and pride. Whatever else one can say about Nelson, he was a man who both lived up to his billing and who, in a very modern way, created it too. Remember, he was the national hero - title and all - in life before Trafalgar as well as in death afterwards. Death just made it more so.Nor is it to encourage those who want to judge him by our own standards rather than those of his own time. Nervertheless, an entirely proper historical argument against the celebration of Trafalgar is that the wrong side won. Nelson, after all, was waging war not just in defence of Britain, but in defence of reactionary and royalist Europe against not just France, but the democratic and republican ideals of the French revolution too.So would it have been such a terrible thing if Napoleon's planned invasion of Britain had taken place? More than a decade after Trafalgar, the fallen emperor explained to his doctor on St Helena what he had in mind in the summer of 1805.""I would have hastened over my flotilla with 200,000 men, landed as near Chatham as possible and proceeded direct to London, where I calculated to arrive in four days from the time of my landing. I would have proclaimed a republic and the abolition of the nobility and the house of peers, the distribution of the property of such of the latter as opposed me among my partisans, liberty, equality and the sovereignty of the people.""Bring it on, some will be tempted to say. Except that we would not have been offered the second half of Napoleon's scenario without the first. The reform would have been established, but it would only have been achieved at the point of a French bayonet. It was a package deal. And if there is one thing that the emperor actually achieved in the many countries on which he briefly imposed republican constitutions, it was to mobilise those countries to get rid of him so that they could govern themselves as free, rather than subject, peoples.A more historically accurate objection is that Trafalgar was not the victory we like to imagine. No, this is not some smart revisionist way of claiming that the French and Spanish actually won a battle they lost. But it is to say that Trafalgar was a victory in a different war to the one in the myth.It is at best arguable that Trafalgar saved Britain from invasion. In fact, Napoleon had turned his armies eastwards, against Austria and Russia, well before Nelson's finest hour. Decisive though it was, Trafalgar did little to alter the course of the Napoleonic wars. But it did mark the climax of the long-running 18th-century battle between Britain and France for global naval supremacy - what some have called the true first world war. ""The major long-term strategic consequence of the battle was that Britain possessed an unchallenged supremacy on the seas for the best part of a century,"" write Tim Clayton and Phil Craig in their book on Trafalgar.So that makes Nelson not the man who saved the nation but the man who made the British empire possible - not a comfortable thought for many, and not intended to be. Except that here too there are subtle issues. Napoleon may have presented himself as a warrior on behalf of 18th-century Enlightenment values, albeit in an increasingly perverted form. But Nelson, like the Royal Navy of his day, was a child of the Enlightenment as well. Nelson's navy would never have been the success that it was without a belief both in science and in treating people well. Nelson's leadership was based, Lambert argues, ""on love, not authority"". And certainly, if there was one thing that everyone agrees about Nelson, it is that his officers and men - black as well as white - thought he was the embodiment of great leadership. It has gone down in history as ""the Nelson touch"".In the end we return to Nelson not because what he represents is easy to accept, but because what he represents is hard to accept; not just because he knew how to command but because he knew how to command in a fight. There is no getting away from it. Nelson was a war leader, not a business leader. His true greatness lay in the clarity with which he persuaded people to follow him into highly aggressive actions that went beyond the limit of what they thought possible - and then, when on their own, to continue to act consistently with the spirit of his plans. Today we would call it empowerment.

Sometimes the line between the two is a fine one.","In some quarters a faintly blank look of surprise greets news of the Guardian's republican stand. Why bother? Aren't there more pressing matters? Are there no poor children, disaster schools, desperate estates, over-crowded prisons?As the Queen trots down the Mall today in her gilded coach, the speech in her golden reticule will no doubt touch upon all these things. It may be mildly comic when the world's richest woman intones her government's concern over the plight of her less fortunate subjects. But so what? Is it really worth investing in the huge turmoil of trying to remove the monarchy when so much else presses? Yes, it is well worth it. She must be Elizabeth the Last. The tyranny of the monarchy lies less in its temporal than its spiritual power: it tyrannises the imagination. Its spirit permeates political thinking, poisons the appetite for reform and deep dyes the blood of Britain with fantasies of who and what we are. Unconquered, never, never slaves, we are all subject to Britannia the monarch. As our glorious heritage parades again today through London to open parliament, Household Cavalry glinting in the sun, all this empty pageantry of wigs and ermine, britches and sticks promises a better yesterday. It breathes the glory of Good Queen Bess and Bluff King Hal, the Empress of India still ruling a rosy pink globe, our island story on display. Do the marching bands bring a tear to the eye? This is what we do so well!  These bare ruined choirs signify nothing, I used to think - picturesque, harmless, good for tourism. But the trappings are not trivial. They trap us in an infantile fairyland of imaginary heritage. Bogus history fuels present national delusion. Look no further than here for the reason why this country breeds small-minded bigotry, Eurosceptic xenophobia, union flag-painted brutes rampaging at foreign football matches. Why is this country so profoundly conservative, government pollsters ask? Somewhere the answer lies wrapped in the ermine. It is why this country is a recalcitrant bad neighbour in Europe, why it struts and swaggers brazenly despite an economy, a productivity and a social fabric so profoundly inferior to theirs.  The monarchy explains why this country fell behind the rest of Europe after the war, never modernised, never leapt ahead as Germany rose from the ashes. Instead victory enshrined the bad old ways, without change or introspection. The spirit of unconquered monarchy ossified a pre-war class hatred that stopped modern industrial cooperation for the first 30 post-war years. Complacent trust in tradition let others get ahead while we declined. Modernisation was not in our bones in those key years. The rest of Europe started again,   those minor countries with monarchies beginning modern post-war contracts between people and crown. Here, nothing changed. A one-term 1945 Labour government left landmarks such as the National Health Service, but no fundamental break with the past.  Now Britain's 21st century politics are still held back by empty ideas of tradition. Europe - whatever its future construction and membership - is our only destiny and yet British politicians are unable to play a full part, to engage or even to speak the truth about it to a people besotted with the magic word ""sovereignty"". Stymied in Europe by nothing but our own bizarre Ruritanian obsessions, things can't go on like this. Year by year it is crippling us. That word sovereignty has to be wrestled to the ground, exposed, redefined and laid to rest with a people that feels it has lost touch with power. It is their sense of powerlessness that makes them misunderstand Europe and panic at ""losing"" what they have too little of already.  Many regard the monarchy as just the glac&eacute; cherry atop the worm-eaten constitution. Labour has been burrowing away at its foundations, removing props and the whole edifice is tottering. No doubt more props can be found for particular glitches - the West Lothian question, the English parliament question, the House of Lords - but no amount of sticking plaster will patch together those fundamental and well justified fears that power is slipping from the people. Globalisation and worse - the failure of global governance to solve global crises in climate change or trade deals - has inflamed this sense of helplessness. Local government is a vacant lot, Westminster is a one-party state punctuated only by raucous prime minister's questions that shame rational debate. The democratic deficit creates a dangerous cynicism about all politics.   Ironically, the more people disengage from politics, the harder it becomes to persuade them that the constitution matters. Even at the height of debate about a Scottish parliament, very few Scots' pulses raced: Mori found barely 10% put it near the top of their list of concerns. Though if threatened now with losing its parliament, the Scots would rebel, Brave Heart rise from his grave. Powerlessness breeds apathy, but real power excites. So a new constitution for Britain may not burn on all lips in the bus queues. It is a ""chattering classes"" question for now - ""Guardian stuff"" nature's conservatives will say. But once offered a fairer distribution of power, people will seize it.  For the next manifesto Labour should promise a great national constitutional convention out of which to forge something better than this. Put everything into the melting pot, all sources of power, toss in the monarchy, Europe, the regions and above all proportional representation: public interest will ignite. Commission a fine preamble to the   first British constitution and begin again. Already Labour's manifesto will promise a new House of Lords and a referendum on PR. Both these raise basic questions. Both require wide and loud debate, opening everything wide.  The people are there already, if asked. A Rowntree/ICM poll in October found 59% wanting PR for Westminster, even more for local government. First-past-the-post has been well discredited in the US. In Britain at the last election the only views that mattered were 168,000 voters in key marginals - 0.5% of those who voted. The rest might just as well never bother - and many didn't. Many disdain the strictly limited party choice on offer. They dislike having candidates foisted on them. They mistrust the vast power in the hands of a prime minister only a minority has voted for. That dangerous disaffection will erupt more often, as over the fuel protests. People who feel denied a voice will become more febrile when they think a government not altogether legitimate - as no doubt George W Bush will discover. Voting systems need to be aired as part of a whole new constitutional settlement.  This is not an abstract issue. Britain now urgently needs an electorate confident enough in its own power to choose to trade some of it with Europe, to multiply its long-term global power. Ironically, the slipping legitimacy of the British system has given us a prime minister with more absolute power than any since the war, yet unable to deliver on his two great projects - Europe and PR. Our essentially two-party system offers no way to build broad based cross-party consent for difficult fundamental change. Lonely as a medieval monarch surrounded by sycophants, British prime ministers become neurotic, prone to cowardice punctuated by bursts of irrational policy-making: the constitution that brought us the poll tax now brings us privatisation of the London tube.  Fine, but leave the Queen out of it, says the palace. However the monarchy is at the very heart of all this. It is not the ornamental cherry but the rotten core of Britain's decrepit democracy. A good constitution does not guarantee a good country - America's fine words are not matched by good governance. But without a new constitution Britain will be unable to shed the baggage of the ages that hold us back and keep us still the barbarian outpost of Europe. <B>Related stories - news</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - comment</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - background</B><BR>

Of the minority, only a handful imprint themselves upon the psyche of a nation. And of the handful, only one or two in a decade become so infamous that they become the emblematic murders of their era. The killing of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by Ian Huntley in the village of Soham is one of those cases. No murder investigation has ever been more lavishly reported. No murder victims have ever acquired the iconic status of Holly and Jessica in their Beckham shirts. (Would the crime have captured the nation if they had been Norwich City fans?)

Such dramas, Orwell concluded, proved irresistible to the readers of middle Britain because they were the ""product of a stable society where the all-prevailing hypocrisy did at least ensure that crimes as serious as murder should have strong emotions behind them"".  Nearly 60 years after Orwell, we are still mesmerised by murder. But the characteristics of the emblematic murder of today are very different from those noted by Orwell. This is strikingly true of the Soham murders, which were committed by a minor public official rather than a professional person, apparently answering to his sexual demons not a cherished passion, and carried out seemingly on the spur of the moment rather than after great planning. If the distinguishing feature of the emblematic murder of the past was its careful premeditation, the equivalent feature of today's is its randomness and its opportunism.  This is why the unprecedented intensity of the coverage of the case is so important. Roy Hattersley rightly observed last week that there has never been anything like it.

It was hardly surprising that Carr was taunted in Holloway before the trial as a second Myra Hindley. Carr was manifestly no such thing, but the tabloid depictions of her in the autumn of 2002 left no doubt that, for some newspaper editors and their readers, Carr now filled the post of national female demon left vacant by Hindley's death.  With every possible due respect to the murdered girls and their families, it has to be aggressively stated that the coverage of this case has been wholly out of proportion to its implied meaning. The subtext of the case is that your daughters are at risk of being murdered if they go out alone, even in a quiet East Anglian village, never mind on the mean streets of the inner city. Yet this is scarcely more true today than it has ever been.   Holly and Jessica, both aged 10, fell into the category of the population - girls aged between five and 16 - that is least likely of all of us to be the victims of murder. When young people are murdered, which after the age of 12 months they rarely are, by far the chief threat to them comes from their parents, then by other adults known to them (as Huntley was), but not from strangers.

But Trafalgar is the classic example of that.Two hundred years ago this week, as he spent his last days ashore, Nelson repeatedly spoke of achieving an ""annihilating"" victory over France. It is a terrible word. But at Trafalgar he made the word a reality. It has to be faced that this is where Nelson's genius lay. Very occasionally it is necessary to do dreadful things. When it is they need doing brilliantly. That was what Nelson achieved, above all others in this country's history. For some it makes him a criminal. For the rest it makes him a hero. Sometimes the line between the two is a fine one."
0,"Every year in this country, several hundred people are murdered. Of the hundreds, only a minority are ever widely reported. Of the minority, only a handful imprint themselves upon the psyche of a nation. And of the handful, only one or two in a decade become so infamous that they become the emblematic murders of their era. The killing of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by Ian Huntley in the village of Soham is one of those cases. No murder investigation has ever been more lavishly reported. No murder victims have ever acquired the iconic status of Holly and Jessica in their Beckham shirts. (Would the crime have captured the nation if they had been Norwich City fans?) Few murder trials have dominated the news for so long as the one that ended at the Old Bailey yesterday.  Ian Huntley has now been instantly consigned to a very select national pandemonium of the nation's most loathed killers. Some of his more recent fellow inmates include Fred and Rose West, Dennis Nilsen, Peter Sutcliffe, Harry Roberts, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. More distant denizens include Dr Harvey Crippen, Jack the Ripper and William Corder of Red Barn fame.  Like them, Huntley will now become a byword for evil and Soham a place like Cranley Gardens and Saddleworth moor, remembered for one awful thing alone. Already last night, the broadcasting schedules were cleared for extended special reports, a rare and revealing tribute to the case. Books will now be hastily written about Huntley's crimes. Official inquiries will be held into how such a man could do such things. In time, criminologists, cultural commentators, novelists and film-makers will all rake over the case in their own ways.  Though the trend in murder is upwards, it remains a very rare crime. Holly and Jessica were two of the total of 1,048 homicides in 2002-03 in England and Wales (the figure has been greatly inflated by the work of Dr Harold Shipman). Their chance of being a murder victim - like yours and mine - was around one in 60,000. Yet murder is obviously also the gravest of all crimes, one of the only serious offences to carry a mandatory sentence. For all their rarity, that select group of emblematic murders has always reflected something special about the dangers, fears and myths of the society in which they took place.  In his 1946 essay on the decline of the English murder, George Orwell reflected on the characteristics of the killings that, then as now, filled the pages of the News of the World. The English murderer, Orwell wrote, would normally be a ""little man of the professional class"", living a respectable and conformist life in the suburbs. He would ""go astray"" through cherishing a passion for his secretary or another man's wife. He would bring himself to the point of murder only after great wrestling with his conscience. Having determined on murder, he then planned   the crime - normally a poisoning - with the utmost cunning, only to be undone by some small unforeseen error. Such dramas, Orwell concluded, proved irresistible to the readers of middle Britain because they were the ""product of a stable society where the all-prevailing hypocrisy did at least ensure that crimes as serious as murder should have strong emotions behind them"".  Nearly 60 years after Orwell, we are still mesmerised by murder. But the characteristics of the emblematic murder of today are very different from those noted by Orwell. This is strikingly true of the Soham murders, which were committed by a minor public official rather than a professional person, apparently answering to his sexual demons not a cherished passion, and carried out seemingly on the spur of the moment rather than after great planning. If the distinguishing feature of the emblematic murder of the past was its careful premeditation, the equivalent feature of today's is its randomness and its opportunism.  This is why the unprecedented intensity of the coverage of the case is so important. Roy Hattersley rightly observed last week that there has never been anything like it. Day after day the case has dominated the airwaves and the front pages. For sheer volume Soham has eclipsed anything generated by the Wests or even by the murder of the toddler James Bulger, never mind the Moors murders or even the penny dreadfuls long ago.  The volume of coverage has been matched only by its often provocative stridency, especially in the weeks that followed the arrests of Huntley and Maxine Carr. This led the attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, to tell journalists last month that ""at times some of the reporting of the investigation and trial has been quite frankly unacceptable"". It was hardly surprising that Carr was taunted in Holloway before the trial as a second Myra Hindley. Carr was manifestly no such thing, but the tabloid depictions of her in the autumn of 2002 left no doubt that, for some newspaper editors and their readers, Carr now filled the post of national female demon left vacant by Hindley's death.  With every possible due respect to the murdered girls and their families, it has to be aggressively stated that the coverage of this case has been wholly out of proportion to its implied meaning. The subtext of the case is that your daughters are at risk of being murdered if they go out alone, even in a quiet East Anglian village, never mind on the mean streets of the inner city. Yet this is scarcely more true today than it has ever been.   Holly and Jessica, both aged 10, fell into the category of the population - girls aged between five and 16 - that is least likely of all of us to be the victims of murder. When young people are murdered, which after the age of 12 months they rarely are, by far the chief threat to them comes from their parents, then by other adults known to them (as Huntley was), but not from strangers. Boys, moreover, are more likely to be murdered than girls.  ""It was the powder keg waiting for the match. I was the match,"" Dennis Nilsen wrote about his own murder spree 20 years ago, implying that someone like himself lurks around every corner of every street. Some will say the same about Huntley's opportunist killings too. The persistent implication is that something like this can happen to anyone, any time, anywhere.  But the reality is that it can't and doesn't. Huntley's was an exceptionally awful crime, but it was also exceptionally unusual. It has been invested with national meaning less because of the crime than because of the way it has been reported. Under pressure from 24-hour news TV channels and the tabloids, the mainstream TV channels and what were then all still broadsheets bowed before the storm. The episode certainly tells us something about the kind of society we have become, but the truth is that it tells us rather more about the decline of the English media than it does about the decline of the English murder.    <BR>","B> The following correction appeared in the Observer's For the Record column, Sunday May 23 2004</B><BR><BR>'A bit rich, but no class' (Comment, below) said 'they shirk the philanthropy of their American counterparts, from Rockefeller and Carnegie onwards', Andrew Carnegie was actually a Scotsman, born in Dunfermline, Fife.

Funerals are difficult. Too basic, and they seem depressing. Too fussy, and they risk vulgarity. One remembers the apocryphal send-off for Woody Allen's grandfather, featuring a buffet table laden with 'a replica of the deceased in potato salad'. Last week, Chatsworth offered its idealised tableau of a British demise. A hearse bearing Andrew Cavendish, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, wound through parkland lined by ribbons of servants in black serge and starched white aprons. The spectacle summarised how the rich die, and how they live. Never, outside a Conrad Black dinner party, have so many below-stairs staff been gathered together. The scene could have been a flashback to the margarine-advert England of Stanley Baldwin, except that Chatsworth's 600 employees are closer to the cast of a club reps docusoap than to old retainers. Most work for the tourist trade, running playgrounds or supplying internet customers with 'Duke's hampers' (price £499, plus £7.95 delivery).  In 1799, the Duke's forebear was the fourth wealthiest man in Britain. Since then, the aristocracy, lacking the wit to invent unopenable milk cartons or flatpack tables, has slithered down the international rich lists. The modern toff has had to compress Adam Smith's three categories of landowner, businessman and labourer into one multi-purpose model. That is why the current Earl of Sandwich is stuffing tuna wraps and why the departing Duke of Devonshire was winged to his rest by short-order chefs from Jean-Pierre's Chatsworth bar.  These days, only tycoons and footballers exist like Bourbon kings. A £700 million lawsuit issued by Hollinger against Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, alleges that the Blacks' excesses included billing the firm for 'household staff, including chefs, senior butlers, butlers, under-butlers, chauffeurs and footmen.' The Blacks' invention of an Almanack de Gotha of the buttling classes intrigued the media less, however, than Lady Amiel-Black's tip to a Bergdorf Goodman store doorman.  It can't have been her creativity that rankled, since many journalists are more inventive with expenses claims. The fascination of the Blacks is, instead, their cocktail of grandeur and frugality, the rich people's traits that others most love to deride. The Duke of Devonshire, a humble man, gave to good causes in the noblesse oblige tradition of the 19th-century landowner, while Hollinger, so its lawsuit claims, paid or promised $250,000 to charities on behalf of Amiel-Black.  The rich are often stingy. Queen Mary was a kleptomaniac who helped herself to knick-knacks from other people's houses, while Ingvar Kamprad, the Ikea founder and the wealthiest man in the world, drives an ancient Volvo. Tycoons have tended, too, towards madness, partly because they can pay others to sustain their worst delusions. Hence the Mormon army employed by the dying Howard Hughes to swat any germ-bearing fly entering the airspaces near the sealed room where he lay watching Ice Station Zebra on a video loop.  Though often selfish and sometimes unhinged, the rich have seldom seemed so dislikeable as now. Maybe plutocrats have to try harder to impress. When anyone with a semi in the right bit of inner London is a millionaire, only dollar billionaires feel truly wealthy. And when the middle classes, too upper crust to dust, hire two million servants of their own, the oligarchy needs better status symbols. In the US, the co-founder of Microsoft has just arrived at a New Orleans conference in the world's largest private yacht. Paul Allen's acquisition has a deck the size of Old Trafford, a submarine in the hold and a fuel tank that takes $250,000 to fill. Think Barbara Amiel's charity budget in unleaded diesel.   Lower down the food chain of plutocracy, fat cats are thriving. Luc Vandevelde, of M&amp;S, received a £450,000 annual package for failing to beguile women with polyester suits and this spring's toeless tights. Vandevelde, though sacked, has so many other lucrative boardroom roles that he will barely make it through M&amp;S's five-items-only checkout.  Ken Clarke told me, when he was Chancellor, that he wished business leaders 'would show a decent level of restraint'. His departure from the Tory script was aimed at proto-fat cats such as Cedric Brown, who was paid like one of Lord Black's Shake'n'Vac army in comparison with today's CEOs. Ten years down the line, optimists dare to think that, if Gordon Brown gets to be Prime Minister, he will tax the rich an extra 1 per cent. That wish may be forlorn. So far, the Chancellor's tax and benefit policy has helped the worst-off and lifted 700,000 children out of poverty. But 3.6m others remain poor, and the income gap is being prised apart by a failure to redistribute wealth.  Reluctance to make the rich pay their share is partly down to the awe in which government holds new money. From the Beckhams to a record influx of foreign billionaires, high-rollers are lionised. The moderately wealthy don't complain, partly because a rentier lifestyle, once for the coked-up sons of earls, is now an aspiration for those with a Fulham postcode and a trust fund for the children. Poorer people are not, by instinct, jealous. And even if they were, militancy was neutered long ago by Thatcher.  Helping the rich is part of the national culture, just as buying the Big Issue, or giving money to beggars, is not. Those on average incomes tend to be embarrassed by the impoverished, while   cheerfully subsidising affluent dependents, such as the royal family. It would be wrong to think that Prince Charles is scaling down the monarchy's extravagance in his current visit to Mount Athos, a remote religious community he uses as a spiritual Champneys. The austere regime is leavened by the prince's habit of arriving, often on a yacht owned by the Latsis dynasty, with 30 suitcases, one police bodyguard, one folding bed, one satellite telephone and several coolboxes of Palace delicacies to replace the monks' inedible bean stew.  Supporting the royals has always been justified, however shakily, by the argument that they work for the public good. New plutocrats do not. With exceptions, such as the Sainsburys, they shirk the philanthropy of their American counterparts, from Rockefeller and Carnegie onwards. Unlike Edwardian aristocrats, they rarely feel compelled, by God, guilt or public duty, to plough an unnecessary penny back into the public domain.  Orwell's moneyed and ruling classes have impacted into one. Nancy Mitford's U and non-U categories are only for snobs with chilblains and defective heating systems. This is a society that disdains rank and prejudice, and which has just been promised a brand new equality commission to uphold high standards. And still, old hierarchies linger.  A hearse goes by, and few scoff at the battalions of retainers that watch it pass, or mock the self-reverence of the rich. Instead, there is a reflex twitch of nostalgia for feudal England. Maybe everyone is suffering from Trollope overload. Or perhaps the revamped squirarchy, custodian of art and purveyor of damson jam online, looks suddenly less alarming than new potentates."
1,"Tony Martin should never have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Punishing the Norfolk farmer in this way is an outrage. It offends any sane person's instincts about the meaning of justice. On the spectrum of heinous murders it places Martin at the same point as the Yorkshire Ripper, which is plainly unacceptable. All murderers do not weigh the same in the scales of human wickedness, yet we discover that they are equal before the law. Something very wrong is happening to a man who went too far, with a terrible result, in defending himself and his property. It is obvious, therefore, that politicians should be heard from. They have a duty to say what they would do not only for Martin but for others in similar situations. William Hague had a go at doing that yesterday. Very naturally there has been an outcry, and you don't have to be a Daily Mail reader to experience the indignation that produces it. But one does need to take a little care. Ends and means bear some examination. The very same political instincts that drive Mr Hague to lash out in all directions are the ones that sent Martin to jail for life. Politicians, especially Tory politicians, are accomplices before the fact of the outrage that has now occurred.  For Martin got his life sentence because the judge had no option but to impose it. Ever since the abolition of capital punishment, life has been mandatory for murder. This was the political sweetener that got rid of the gallows, a necessary reassurance to the public at that revolutionary penal moment.  But as the gallows receded, the weakness of the mandatory life sentence became clearer, precisely for the reason that it fails to distinguish between the Ripper and the farmer. By lumping all murders together, it reduces recognition of what is truly heinous, and nullifies the grades of stigma between a desperate act of domestic violence and contract murders by a professional killer.  Over the years, there has been a build-up of studies and reports with detailed argument showing that life should be a maximum and not a mandatory sentence for murder. It would not only be fairer but more effective. The Butler committee said so in 1975, the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1978, the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group in 1986, a House of Lords select committee in 1989. All lord chief justices in living memory have thought that a judge was no less qualified to exercise discretion in murder cases than in others, and to determine a fixed sentence appropriate to the case - retaining life only for the very worst.  If this collective wisdom had been followed, Tony Martin would now be serving a proper and not a repugnant sentence for murder. But the wisdom was spurned by politicians. Although it acquired critical mass in the Tory years, no home secretary would listen to it. David Waddington said removing mandatory life would ""greatly damage public confidence"". Kenneth Baker said that all murder, whatever the circumstances, was more abhorrent than any other crime. Douglas Hurd, an aspirant reformer, said it was impossible to get away from the politics of it. None of them paid attention to their colleague, Lord Chancellor Hailsham, who scorned the mandatory life rule and what he called the ""hairy heel of populism"" that made it apparently untouchable.   The Martin case could be used as a unique moment to turn the hairy heel to advantage. Isn't it the best proof yet available of how mandatory life sentences can offend popular instincts? Couldn't the thorny issues of what is appropriate self-defence and what is reasonable force be dealt with, after the jury has spoken, precisely by the judicial discretion that the mandatory sentence takes away? If, as the tabloids and the Tories scream, a better balance must be struck between wicked criminals and overheated householders with a gun to hand, isn't reform of the blanket life sentence by far the most sensible way to do it?   Not to William Hague. Nor to Jack Straw - though abolishing mandatory life is another penal reform Labour once favoured but now rejects. Instead Hague finds the conventional populist appeal irresistible, and overlooks the penal failures it incessantly produced during the Thatcher-Howard years. In 1996, after all, Michael Howard produced mandatory minimum three-year sentences for persistent domestic burglars, which didn't do much good to Tony Martin. A decade of answering what Hague now righteously calls ""an explosion of anger among millions of law abiding people"" with explosions of anger by ranting politicians had limited success in crime-reduction, and still less in restoring to society a hard sense of the difference between right and wrong.  There are many reasons for that failure: moral decline, godless materialism, social neglect, personal indifference, a duty-free society. For vigilante-ism to be written into law, the remedy Hague comes close to proposing, is insupportable, but people must be able, within the law, to defend themselves proportionately to the threat they face. Martin had an illegal weapon, and committed a shocking crime. The issue is the context, especially the legal context, in which this should henceforth be dealt with. There are sharply contrasting possibilities.  The politicians' way is to pass sweeping laws of ever greater crudity. These are what have put Tony Martin in jail for life, and Hague   wants more of them. They reject individual justice, in favour of grand statements that brush aside particulars. They may catch some serious criminals and send them down for a long time, but people of minor as well as major evil are caught in a penal regime which, more and more over the past decade, has promoted political over judicial decision-making. Life sentences, with discretion over the real time served given to the home secretary, are a burgeoning phenomenon of the British system, now extending well beyond murder. They undermine the notion of justice as a juridical not a political commodity, applying to people not to categories, addressing real lives and not tabloid furies.  The judges' way is different. The judge uses his judgment in all the circum- stances. He can look at Tony Martin and see he's not one of the Krays. Restoring his power to discriminate between one murderer and another would restore justice without imperilling social order in any way. Judges can be as hard as politicians, but aren't locked into a system that guarantees injustice. Actually, they will get their power back. As the Bulger case showed, political intervention in sentencing is beginning to seep away, because it violates the European human rights convention. This will retrieve some sanity. But not before the Martin case has sent politicians raging in the wrong direction.  <A","Down at the wire, the word that fits the Trimble/Adams stand-off is a strange one. Artificial. That's the sense that screams from the positions taken by either side. Both are gripped by what they see as matters of inalienable substance: the substance of arms, of lifelong passion, of sanctified conviction, of justified mistrust, above all the substance of history. Could any two men on the face of the planet be deeper dug in behind impermeable rocks of actuality? But when you look at it, what their argument most seems is unreal. Consider Mr Trimble and his party. They have already come a long way. They wanted the Good Friday deal, and their leader has taken some risks to keep it alive. They know, also, that the IRA will never give up all its weapons. They knew that all along. It is one of the givens they have learned to tolerate, as they contemplate sitting alongside former killers and torturers on the Northern Ireland executive.  They well understand, even if Sinn Fein-IRA were to hand over some weapons now, and make a pledge on decommissioning later, that arms will remain. The possibility of re-starting hostilities will be there, moving out from arms dumps whose location the IRA has presumably mapped with greater exactness than it did the murder-graves of 20 years ago.  Knowing this, the Ulster Unionists none the less sat down with Sinn Fein-IRA, and talked about a future that, as everyone silently understood, encompassed it. They did this because they believed the process would assist the outcome, saying, in effect, that politics should be allowed to take over, and that this experience in itself would begin to render the arms redundant. This was the point of Good Friday. With the growth of politics, battle would finally cease.  Yet, having swallowed all that, which required an impressive if long-delayed magnanimity on the Unionists' part, they are now balking. They can't make the final stride. They refuse to let the executive start functioning unless this is preceded by some tiny sign from the other side. The camel is digested, but the gnat sticks immovably in the throat.  Republicans too, however, are masters of the artificial point. By offering this tiny sign, they would lose nothing. The scenario which the Unionists have privately conceded acknowledges that some weaponry would always, in the real world, remain. Certainly a great deal of it would still be there next week and next month if, this week, the IRA were to meet Mr Blair's deadline and launch a decommissioning process. For all that is asked of them, to keep momentum going, is a token, in effect a nullity, a symbolic act: a gesture of entirely artificial importance.  Yet they cannot do it. And people humour them in the not-doing of it. They established some time ago, especially among mainland opinion that is anywhere close to the government, that they could not be expected to do it. History entirely ruled it out. Those of us who wrote in the opposite sense - said that some little gesture of symbolic disarming was a sine qua non which Unionists were entitled to rely on - were given lectures about our regrettable insensitivity and our woeful lack of realism.  Sinn Fein-IRA has, like the Unionists, come quite far. It accepted the consent principle, protecting the democratic rights of the Ulster majority. It complied with the impulse in Dublin to redefine the constitutional objective of a united Ireland. It embarked on a process which implicitly conceded that its departed heroes had fought and died in a struggle that could no longer be won by military means.  But Mr Adams too, like Mr Trimble, goes to the wire quite willing, it would seem, to jeopardise all this by his resistance to a very small point. Actually, of the two, Sinn Fein's sabotage, if this is what it proves to be, is the more culpable. It has seized more, while offering less. It has got many of its killers out of prison early, but is not prepared even to urge that decommissioning should happen. While insisting on its separateness from the IRA, it will not expend so much as a single word telling the IRA what it thinks it should do.  Sinn Fein, in other words, will take hardly any risks. We assume that Mr Adams is desperate for Good Friday to survive, but he exhibits no equivalent public urgency. While goading Mr Trimble to take one more risk, he affects to believe that for his part it is not within his power to take the one everyone wants him to, because he continues to shelter behind the claim - the insulting fiction - that he carries no influence with the IRA. Judged by where it now stands, the negotiation has been one-sided in the concessions made, while sustaining the ridiculous pretence that any party close to a paramilitary group could not bring about sufficient decommissioning to allow the peace process to continue and the institutions to start work  All the same, the points at issue remain definable by that word: artificial. Taking the process as a whole, their reality does not accord in any way with the scale of the prize that is otherwise available. Both sides have expended great effort, alongside the British and Irish governments, to achieve a change that has eluded these islands for 30 years - to name but the most recent fragment of time. It would now take only a small shift by either or both of them to enable the larger deal to make a measure of progress.  It is tempting to say this has to come from Sinn Fein. For while it is certainly easier to say what Mr Trimble should do - to tell him, with lofty disregard for his viability as leader of a functioning party, to move ahead without any decommissioning gesture from the other side -Sinn Fein's recalcitrance has been the more unyielding, and therefore the more culpably calamitous for the project its leaders want to see succeed.  What is more striking than the fault to be found in one side or the other, however, is the failure they share: their absence of perspective in the end-game. Must the gnats have another accursed victory? This is what today and tomorrow will have to be about. A venture that has seen, from all sides, a fair amount of largeness - reluctant and chippy and unadmitted, but also large - is in danger of collapsing round points that are not, in the broad scheme of things already accomplished, either large or real. Perhaps this is a definition of the Irish problem. But that is what seemed so close to being re-defined."

Of the hundreds, only a minority are ever widely reported. Of the minority, only a handful imprint themselves upon the psyche of a nation. And of the handful, only one or two in a decade become so infamous that they become the emblematic murders of their era. The killing of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by Ian Huntley in the village of Soham is one of those cases. No murder investigation has ever been more lavishly reported. No murder victims have ever acquired the iconic status of Holly and Jessica in their Beckham shirts. (Would the crime have captured the nation if they had been Norwich City fans?) Few murder trials have dominated the news for so long as the one that ended at the Old Bailey yesterday.  Ian Huntley has now been instantly consigned to a very select national pandemonium of the nation's most loathed killers. Some of his more recent fellow inmates include Fred and Rose West, Dennis Nilsen, Peter Sutcliffe, Harry Roberts, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. More distant denizens include Dr Harvey Crippen, Jack the Ripper and William Corder of Red Barn fame.  Like them, Huntley will now become a byword for evil and Soham a place like Cranley Gardens and Saddleworth moor, remembered for one awful thing alone. Already last night, the broadcasting schedules were cleared for extended special reports, a rare and revealing tribute to the case. Books will now be hastily written about Huntley's crimes. Official inquiries will be held into how such a man could do such things. In time, criminologists, cultural commentators, novelists and film-makers will all rake over the case in their own ways.  Though the trend in murder is upwards, it remains a very rare crime. Holly and Jessica were two of the total of 1,048 homicides in 2002-03 in England and Wales (the figure has been greatly inflated by the work of Dr Harold Shipman). Their chance of being a murder victim - like yours and mine - was around one in 60,000. Yet murder is obviously also the gravest of all crimes, one of the only serious offences to carry a mandatory sentence. For all their rarity, that select group of emblematic murders has always reflected something special about the dangers, fears and myths of the society in which they took place.  In his 1946 essay on the decline of the English murder, George Orwell reflected on the characteristics of the killings that, then as now, filled the pages of the News of the World. The English murderer, Orwell wrote, would normally be a ""little man of the professional class"", living a respectable and conformist life in the suburbs. He would ""go astray"" through cherishing a passion for his secretary or another man's wife. He would bring himself to the point of murder only after great wrestling with his conscience. Having determined on murder, he then planned   the crime - normally a poisoning - with the utmost cunning, only to be undone by some small unforeseen error. Such dramas, Orwell concluded, proved irresistible to the readers of middle Britain because they were the ""product of a stable society where the all-prevailing hypocrisy did at least ensure that crimes as serious as murder should have strong emotions behind them"".  Nearly 60 years after Orwell, we are still mesmerised by murder. But the characteristics of the emblematic murder of today are very different from those noted by Orwell. This is strikingly true of the Soham murders, which were committed by a minor public official rather than a professional person, apparently answering to his sexual demons not a cherished passion, and carried out seemingly on the spur of the moment rather than after great planning. If the distinguishing feature of the emblematic murder of the past was its careful premeditation, the equivalent feature of today's is its randomness and its opportunism.  This is why the unprecedented intensity of the coverage of the case is so important. Roy Hattersley rightly observed last week that there has never been anything like it. Day after day the case has dominated the airwaves and the front pages. For sheer volume Soham has eclipsed anything generated by the Wests or even by the murder of the toddler James Bulger, never mind the Moors murders or even the penny dreadfuls long ago.  The volume of coverage has been matched only by its often provocative stridency, especially in the weeks that followed the arrests of Huntley and Maxine Carr. This led the attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, to tell journalists last month that ""at times some of the reporting of the investigation and trial has been quite frankly unacceptable"". It was hardly surprising that Carr was taunted in Holloway before the trial as a second Myra Hindley. Carr was manifestly no such thing, but the tabloid depictions of her in the autumn of 2002 left no doubt that, for some newspaper editors and their readers, Carr now filled the post of national female demon left vacant by Hindley's death.  With every possible due respect to the murdered girls and their families, it has to be aggressively stated that the coverage of this case has been wholly out of proportion to its implied meaning. The subtext of the case is that your daughters are at risk of being murdered if they go out alone, even in a quiet East Anglian village, never mind on the mean streets of the inner city. Yet this is scarcely more true today than it has ever been.   Holly and Jessica, both aged 10, fell into the category of the population - girls aged between five and 16 - that is least likely of all of us to be the victims of murder. When young people are murdered, which after the age of 12 months they rarely are, by far the chief threat to them comes from their parents, then by other adults known to them (as Huntley was), but not from strangers. Boys, moreover, are more likely to be murdered than girls.  ""It was the powder keg waiting for the match. I was the match,"" Dennis Nilsen wrote about his own murder spree 20 years ago, implying that someone like himself lurks around every corner of every street. Some will say the same about Huntley's opportunist killings too. The persistent implication is that something like this can happen to anyone, any time, anywhere.  But the reality is that it can't and doesn't. Huntley's was an exceptionally awful crime, but it was also exceptionally unusual. It has been invested with national meaning less because of the crime than because of the way it has been reported. Under pressure from 24-hour news TV channels and the tabloids, the mainstream TV channels and what were then all still broadsheets bowed before the storm. The episode certainly tells us something about the kind of society we have become, but the truth is that it tells us rather more about the decline of the English media than it does about the decline of the English murder.    <BR>"
1,"Down at the wire, the word that fits the Trimble/Adams stand-off is a strange one. Artificial. That's the sense that screams from the positions taken by either side. Both are gripped by what they see as matters of inalienable substance: the substance of arms, of lifelong passion, of sanctified conviction, of justified mistrust, above all the substance of history. Could any two men on the face of the planet be deeper dug in behind impermeable rocks of actuality? But when you look at it, what their argument most seems is unreal. Consider Mr Trimble and his party. They have already come a long way. They wanted the Good Friday deal, and their leader has taken some risks to keep it alive. They know, also, that the IRA will never give up all its weapons. They knew that all along. It is one of the givens they have learned to tolerate, as they contemplate sitting alongside former killers and torturers on the Northern Ireland executive.  They well understand, even if Sinn Fein-IRA were to hand over some weapons now, and make a pledge on decommissioning later, that arms will remain. The possibility of re-starting hostilities will be there, moving out from arms dumps whose location the IRA has presumably mapped with greater exactness than it did the murder-graves of 20 years ago.  Knowing this, the Ulster Unionists none the less sat down with Sinn Fein-IRA, and talked about a future that, as everyone silently understood, encompassed it. They did this because they believed the process would assist the outcome, saying, in effect, that politics should be allowed to take over, and that this experience in itself would begin to render the arms redundant. This was the point of Good Friday. With the growth of politics, battle would finally cease.  Yet, having swallowed all that, which required an impressive if long-delayed magnanimity on the Unionists' part, they are now balking. They can't make the final stride. They refuse to let the executive start functioning unless this is preceded by some tiny sign from the other side. The camel is digested, but the gnat sticks immovably in the throat.  Republicans too, however, are masters of the artificial point. By offering this tiny sign, they would lose nothing. The scenario which the Unionists have privately conceded acknowledges that some weaponry would always, in the real world, remain. Certainly a great deal of it would still be there next week and next month if, this week, the IRA were to meet Mr Blair's deadline and launch a decommissioning process. For all that is asked of them, to keep momentum going, is a token, in effect a nullity, a symbolic act: a gesture of entirely artificial importance.  Yet they cannot do it. And people humour them in the not-doing of it. They established some time ago, especially among mainland opinion that is anywhere close to the government, that they could not be expected to do it. History entirely ruled it out. Those of us who wrote in the opposite sense - said that some little gesture of symbolic disarming was a sine qua non which Unionists were entitled to rely on - were given lectures about our regrettable insensitivity and our woeful lack of realism.  Sinn Fein-IRA has, like the Unionists, come quite far. It accepted the consent principle, protecting the democratic rights of the Ulster majority. It complied with the impulse in Dublin to redefine the constitutional objective of a united Ireland. It embarked on a process which implicitly conceded that its departed heroes had fought and died in a struggle that could no longer be won by military means.  But Mr Adams too, like Mr Trimble, goes to the wire quite willing, it would seem, to jeopardise all this by his resistance to a very small point. Actually, of the two, Sinn Fein's sabotage, if this is what it proves to be, is the more culpable. It has seized more, while offering less. It has got many of its killers out of prison early, but is not prepared even to urge that decommissioning should happen. While insisting on its separateness from the IRA, it will not expend so much as a single word telling the IRA what it thinks it should do.  Sinn Fein, in other words, will take hardly any risks. We assume that Mr Adams is desperate for Good Friday to survive, but he exhibits no equivalent public urgency. While goading Mr Trimble to take one more risk, he affects to believe that for his part it is not within his power to take the one everyone wants him to, because he continues to shelter behind the claim - the insulting fiction - that he carries no influence with the IRA. Judged by where it now stands, the negotiation has been one-sided in the concessions made, while sustaining the ridiculous pretence that any party close to a paramilitary group could not bring about sufficient decommissioning to allow the peace process to continue and the institutions to start work  All the same, the points at issue remain definable by that word: artificial. Taking the process as a whole, their reality does not accord in any way with the scale of the prize that is otherwise available. Both sides have expended great effort, alongside the British and Irish governments, to achieve a change that has eluded these islands for 30 years - to name but the most recent fragment of time. It would now take only a small shift by either or both of them to enable the larger deal to make a measure of progress.  It is tempting to say this has to come from Sinn Fein. For while it is certainly easier to say what Mr Trimble should do - to tell him, with lofty disregard for his viability as leader of a functioning party, to move ahead without any decommissioning gesture from the other side -Sinn Fein's recalcitrance has been the more unyielding, and therefore the more culpably calamitous for the project its leaders want to see succeed.  What is more striking than the fault to be found in one side or the other, however, is the failure they share: their absence of perspective in the end-game. Must the gnats have another accursed victory? This is what today and tomorrow will have to be about. A venture that has seen, from all sides, a fair amount of largeness - reluctant and chippy and unadmitted, but also large - is in danger of collapsing round points that are not, in the broad scheme of things already accomplished, either large or real. Perhaps this is a definition of the Irish problem. But that is what seemed so close to being re-defined.","Tony Martin should never have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Punishing the Norfolk farmer in this way is an outrage. It offends any sane person's instincts about the meaning of justice. On the spectrum of heinous murders it places Martin at the same point as the Yorkshire Ripper, which is plainly unacceptable. All murderers do not weigh the same in the scales of human wickedness, yet we discover that they are equal before the law. Something very wrong is happening to a man who went too far, with a terrible result, in defending himself and his property. It is obvious, therefore, that politicians should be heard from. They have a duty to say what they would do not only for Martin but for others in similar situations. William Hague had a go at doing that yesterday. Very naturally there has been an outcry, and you don't have to be a Daily Mail reader to experience the indignation that produces it. But one does need to take a little care. Ends and means bear some examination. The very same political instincts that drive Mr Hague to lash out in all directions are the ones that sent Martin to jail for life. Politicians, especially Tory politicians, are accomplices before the fact of the outrage that has now occurred.  For Martin got his life sentence because the judge had no option but to impose it. Ever since the abolition of capital punishment, life has been mandatory for murder. This was the political sweetener that got rid of the gallows, a necessary reassurance to the public at that revolutionary penal moment.  But as the gallows receded, the weakness of the mandatory life sentence became clearer, precisely for the reason that it fails to distinguish between the Ripper and the farmer. By lumping all murders together, it reduces recognition of what is truly heinous, and nullifies the grades of stigma between a desperate act of domestic violence and contract murders by a professional killer.  Over the years, there has been a build-up of studies and reports with detailed argument showing that life should be a maximum and not a mandatory sentence for murder. It would not only be fairer but more effective. The Butler committee said so in 1975, the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1978, the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group in 1986, a House of Lords select committee in 1989. All lord chief justices in living memory have thought that a judge was no less qualified to exercise discretion in murder cases than in others, and to determine a fixed sentence appropriate to the case - retaining life only for the very worst.  If this collective wisdom had been followed, Tony Martin would now be serving a proper and not a repugnant sentence for murder. But the wisdom was spurned by politicians. Although it acquired critical mass in the Tory years, no home secretary would listen to it. David Waddington said removing mandatory life would ""greatly damage public confidence"". Kenneth Baker said that all murder, whatever the circumstances, was more abhorrent than any other crime. Douglas Hurd, an aspirant reformer, said it was impossible to get away from the politics of it. None of them paid attention to their colleague, Lord Chancellor Hailsham, who scorned the mandatory life rule and what he called the ""hairy heel of populism"" that made it apparently untouchable.   The Martin case could be used as a unique moment to turn the hairy heel to advantage. Isn't it the best proof yet available of how mandatory life sentences can offend popular instincts? Couldn't the thorny issues of what is appropriate self-defence and what is reasonable force be dealt with, after the jury has spoken, precisely by the judicial discretion that the mandatory sentence takes away? If, as the tabloids and the Tories scream, a better balance must be struck between wicked criminals and overheated householders with a gun to hand, isn't reform of the blanket life sentence by far the most sensible way to do it?   Not to William Hague. Nor to Jack Straw - though abolishing mandatory life is another penal reform Labour once favoured but now rejects. Instead Hague finds the conventional populist appeal irresistible, and overlooks the penal failures it incessantly produced during the Thatcher-Howard years. In 1996, after all, Michael Howard produced mandatory minimum three-year sentences for persistent domestic burglars, which didn't do much good to Tony Martin. A decade of answering what Hague now righteously calls ""an explosion of anger among millions of law abiding people"" with explosions of anger by ranting politicians had limited success in crime-reduction, and still less in restoring to society a hard sense of the difference between right and wrong.  There are many reasons for that failure: moral decline, godless materialism, social neglect, personal indifference, a duty-free society. For vigilante-ism to be written into law, the remedy Hague comes close to proposing, is insupportable, but people must be able, within the law, to defend themselves proportionately to the threat they face. Martin had an illegal weapon, and committed a shocking crime. The issue is the context, especially the legal context, in which this should henceforth be dealt with. There are sharply contrasting possibilities.  The politicians' way is to pass sweeping laws of ever greater crudity. These are what have put Tony Martin in jail for life, and Hague   wants more of them. They reject individual justice, in favour of grand statements that brush aside particulars. They may catch some serious criminals and send them down for a long time, but people of minor as well as major evil are caught in a penal regime which, more and more over the past decade, has promoted political over judicial decision-making. Life sentences, with discretion over the real time served given to the home secretary, are a burgeoning phenomenon of the British system, now extending well beyond murder. They undermine the notion of justice as a juridical not a political commodity, applying to people not to categories, addressing real lives and not tabloid furies.  The judges' way is different. The judge uses his judgment in all the circum- stances. He can look at Tony Martin and see he's not one of the Krays. Restoring his power to discriminate between one murderer and another would restore justice without imperilling social order in any way. Judges can be as hard as politicians, but aren't locked into a system that guarantees injustice. Actually, they will get their power back. As the Bulger case showed, political intervention in sentencing is beginning to seep away, because it violates the European human rights convention. This will retrieve some sanity. But not before the Martin case has sent politicians raging in the wrong direction.  <A"

Britain stopped exporting contaminated cattle feed to Europe in 1991 (though we continued sending it to the third world until 1996). In most other EU countries cases have already peaked and declined, as expected. But in France, the number of infected animals has doubled in the last year. It is impossible to see how this pattern could result from the export of British bone meal. The simple fact is that the transmission of BSE has never been satisfactorily explained by the prevailing theory. The consumption of meat and bone meal from infected cows has doubtless had an important role to play. Yet this explanation alone fails to account for the huge numbers of cattle in Britain which continued to become infected after most contaminated feed had been removed from the food chain. The latest research on the human form of the disease, nvCJD, published three weeks ago, failed to find any link with the consumption of infected beef.  You might have imagined that when its theory isn't working, a government would wish to test the alternatives. But the British administration has, so far, sought only to attack a hypothesis which does appear to fit the facts. Since 1988, a Somerset farmer called Mark Purdey has been arguing that scientists have overlooked the root causes of BSE. Self-taught and self- financed, he has mastered the brain's complex biochemical pathways and this year published a groundbreaking paper in a respected medical journal. His reward is to have been reviled, misrepresented and physically attacked.  Prions, the brain proteins whose alteration seems to be responsible for BSE, are designed to protect the brain from the oxidising properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultra- violet light, Purdey argues. When, he suggests, the prion proteins are exposed to too little copper and too much manganese, the manganese takes the place of the copper the prion normally binds to. This means that the protein becomes distorted and loses its function.   BSE arose in British herds during the 1980s, Mark Purdey asserts, because the Ministry of Agriculture started forcing all cattle farmers to treat their animals with an organophosphate pesticide called phosmet, at far higher doses than are used elsewhere in the world. The pesticide had to be poured along the line of the spinal cord. Phosmet, Purdey has shown, captures copper. At the same time, cattle feed was being supplemented with chicken manure, from birds dosed with manganese to increase their egg yield. The prion proteins in the cows' brains were   both deprived of copper and dosed with manganese. In France, the use of phosmet first became mandatory in Brittany. Twenty of the country's initial 28 cases of BSE emerged there. BSE's subsequent spread, Purdey maintains, mirrors the use of the pesticide.  Poisoning by similar means may explain the distribution of the human form of the disease. Of the two main clusters in Britain one, in Kent, is in the middle of a fruit and hop growing area where huge quantities of both organophosphates and manganese-based fungicides are used. The other is in Queniborough in Leicestershire, whose dyeworks (until they caught fire a few years ago, spraying chemicals over the village) used to dump some of their residues into the sewage system, Purdey alleges. The sewage was spread over the fields. Dyeworks use shedloads of manganese.  Purdey has tested his theory on BSE and CJD clusters in Iceland, Colorado, Slovakia and Sardinia. He found that people and animals had been exposed to deficiencies of   copper and surfeits of manganese. Most of the clusters, intriguingly, are in mountainous areas, where levels of ultraviolet light are high. But the most compelling evidence in support of his hypothesis comes from a paper published by a team of biochemists at Cambridge this year. They found that when copper was substituted by manganese in prion proteins, the prions adopted precisely the distinguishing features which identify the infective agent in BSE.  If Purdey is right, he deserves a Nobel Prize for medicine. Instead he has been shot at, his phone lines have been cut and his house has been burnt down. The Ministry of Agriculture, which for 50 years has enjoyed a dangerously close relationship with the agrochemical industry, has repeatedly sought to discredit him. Suddenly, however, its tone has changed, and it has now promised to start funding his research. The families of the French victims of CJD are threatening to sue the British government, and it desperately needs an alternative transmission theory. With funding on its way, and new evidence accumulating every month, a self-educated Somerset dairy farmer could be about to overturn the entire body of scientific research on the biggest public health scandal of modern times."
1,"The House discussed the leaking of the Stephen Lawrence report yesterday. Here was a crucially important document whose contents go to the roots of our national malaise.  So naturally, it was the opportunity for a gigantic festival of hypocrisy, an orgy of cant, a saturnalia of double-speak.   We heard a government minister actually suggest that he had tried to stamp on the early publication of the report 'out of respect for this House and its procedures.'   Even some Labour MPs seemed taken aback. Respect for the House? The Government regards MPs much as a pharaoh looked on the slaves building his pyramid. He was glad to see them at work, and some tiny corner of him might even be grateful, but he would never dream of taking them on one side to discuss the plans.   Jack Straw, previously the recipient of the kindest epithet any politician can give another 'a safe pair of hands' was in deep trouble.   The mess over the injunctions had made him look foolish. The claim that he had acted in the interests of Parliament made him look weaselly as well.   Then he alleged that his real motive was to avoid 'distress to the Lawrence family' whom, it turned out, he had not consulted on the matter.   This was a desperate throw, an attempt to imply that anyone who criticised Jack Straw was actually trampling over people who have suffered agonies for more than six years.   But the slaves behind him were well-drilled, having felt the knotted rope on their backs too often. They cheered all his assertions, even the most ridiculous, and when Norman Fowler said that he felt 'the strongest sympathy for the family' they actually yelled 'No!' Of course the shadow home secretary went over the top. The Tories always do. Perhaps they think no one will pay attention unless they froth with rabid fury.   'Humiliating climbdown' he said. 'Defies belief . . . defiance of parliamentary democracy . . . a shabby episode that shows this government at its worst.' Although, as Gerald Kaufman pointed out a few moments later, Mr Fowler's party had pursued Sarah Tisdall into jail, had tried to put Clive Ponting into jail, and had pursued the Spycatcher case all the way to Australia.   So which was worse, a Tory claiming to be valiant for the freedom of the press, or a Labour backbencher implying that a problem does not exist if the last government got it wrong too? Mr Fowler had admitted that he was a director of a newspaper company, so Mr Straw startlingly accused him of 'speaking as a newspaper executive and not as an MP.'   'Cheap little man!' Mr Fowler muttered at this daft allegation. Tories demanded that he withdraw.   Betty Boothroyd said she had been distracted and had not heard what Mr Straw had said. (Who could blame her? If I were Speaker I would have a miniature TV fitted to my arm rest, so that I could catch Captain Pugwash instead.) Mr Straw repeated the charge. 'Bullseye!' yelled some ridiculous Labour sycophant.   Betty gently called on Jack to withdraw. 'I withdraw the remark,' he muttered. 'Apologise!' the Tories screamed.   'I apologise,' he mumbled at his chest, in the way which makes every parent yell: 'Say it as if you meant it!' There was a difference, he said, between a judicial inquiry and a 'run-of-the-mill government publication.'  The implication of this, that the Government could leak what it liked when it liked, raised the Tories to new levels of ersatz anger.   David Winnick, Keith Vaz and Diane Abbott tightened the hysterical atmosphere by, in effect, accusing the Conservatives of racism and contempt for the Lawrence family. 'I am disgusted . . . they did nothing about race and racism when they were in power!' said Mr Vaz, as if that had any bearing on Mr Straw's misjudgment.   The House at its very worst, as we old Commons hands say.","The Tories are trying to turn Northern Ireland into a party political issue. They know they shouldn't really, but they just can't stop themselves.

They are like hungry schoolboys. (Mr Hague looks permanently like a hungry schoolboy). They haven't had anything decent to eat since goodness knows when. And there, cooling on the window sill, is a delicious apple pie.

They know they shouldn't take it. They know they'll get into trouble. They know that they'll get stomach pains if they scoff it all. But they cannot help it.

You can hardly blame them. The more things deteriorate for the Government, the worse they become for the Tories. Just when Mr Hague must have thought that his job couldn't get any more horrible, someone leaked a story that he intends to sack the older half of his shadow cabinet, so he has had to spend the last 48 hours desperately sucking up to that collection of misfits, malfeasors and ghouls. (To quote Jeremy Hardy, if they'd all been born in the same village, you'd blame pollution in the water supply.)

Not that Northern Ireland isn't a legitimate subject. Not that the Government is definitely right in an appallingly difficult judgment call. It's just that for 30 years the general view at Westminster has been that however awful our opponents are, the IRA and the paramilitaries are a thousand times worse, so we'd better stick together.

Mr Hague asked six long questions yesterday and got six equally long answers. He seemed to be convinced that Mr Blair was trying to prevent him from raising the issue. He was copying those pork-pie hatted columnists in the old-fashioned tabloids: ''The Man They Cannot Gag!''

For his part, Mr Blair seemed wounded. He accepted that the process was imperfect and the peace it had created was imperfect. ''But it is better than no process and no peace at all.''

The Tory Government had had to make difficult judgments too. ''They were in secret negotiations with the IRA, denied they were doing so, came to the House and admitted it, and when they did so, not one of us complained, because we knew how difficult the process was.''

''Opposition members may complain!'' said Mr Hague, waving his arm at the Labour benches. Did he imagine, subconsciously, that his party was still in power? Or had he realised that there was precious little opposition to be found on his own side?

Mr Blair warned about ''the enormous consequences'' of interrupting the process now.

0,"The House discussed the leaking of the Stephen Lawrence report yesterday. Here was a crucially important document whose contents go to the roots of our national malaise.  So naturally, it was the opportunity for a gigantic festival of hypocrisy, an orgy of cant, a saturnalia of double-speak.   We heard a government minister actually suggest that he had tried to stamp on the early publication of the report 'out of respect for this House and its procedures.'   Even some Labour MPs seemed taken aback. Respect for the House? The Government regards MPs much as a pharaoh looked on the slaves building his pyramid. He was glad to see them at work, and some tiny corner of him might even be grateful, but he would never dream of taking them on one side to discuss the plans.   Jack Straw, previously the recipient of the kindest epithet any politician can give another 'a safe pair of hands' was in deep trouble.   The mess over the injunctions had made him look foolish. The claim that he had acted in the interests of Parliament made him look weaselly as well.   Then he alleged that his real motive was to avoid 'distress to the Lawrence family' whom, it turned out, he had not consulted on the matter.   This was a desperate throw, an attempt to imply that anyone who criticised Jack Straw was actually trampling over people who have suffered agonies for more than six years.   But the slaves behind him were well-drilled, having felt the knotted rope on their backs too often. They cheered all his assertions, even the most ridiculous, and when Norman Fowler said that he felt 'the strongest sympathy for the family' they actually yelled 'No!' Of course the shadow home secretary went over the top. The Tories always do. Perhaps they think no one will pay attention unless they froth with rabid fury.   'Humiliating climbdown' he said. 'Defies belief . . . defiance of parliamentary democracy . . . a shabby episode that shows this government at its worst.' Although, as Gerald Kaufman pointed out a few moments later, Mr Fowler's party had pursued Sarah Tisdall into jail, had tried to put Clive Ponting into jail, and had pursued the Spycatcher case all the way to Australia.   So which was worse, a Tory claiming to be valiant for the freedom of the press, or a Labour backbencher implying that a problem does not exist if the last government got it wrong too? Mr Fowler had admitted that he was a director of a newspaper company, so Mr Straw startlingly accused him of 'speaking as a newspaper executive and not as an MP.'   'Cheap little man!' Mr Fowler muttered at this daft allegation. Tories demanded that he withdraw.   Betty Boothroyd said she had been distracted and had not heard what Mr Straw had said. (Who could blame her? If I were Speaker I would have a miniature TV fitted to my arm rest, so that I could catch Captain Pugwash instead.) Mr Straw repeated the charge. 'Bullseye!' yelled some ridiculous Labour sycophant.   Betty gently called on Jack to withdraw. 'I withdraw the remark,' he muttered. 'Apologise!' the Tories screamed.   'I apologise,' he mumbled at his chest, in the way which makes every parent yell: 'Say it as if you meant it!' There was a difference, he said, between a judicial inquiry and a 'run-of-the-mill government publication.'  The implication of this, that the Government could leak what it liked when it liked, raised the Tories to new levels of ersatz anger.   David Winnick, Keith Vaz and Diane Abbott tightened the hysterical atmosphere by, in effect, accusing the Conservatives of racism and contempt for the Lawrence family. 'I am disgusted . . . they did nothing about race and racism when they were in power!' said Mr Vaz, as if that had any bearing on Mr Straw's misjudgment.   The House at its very worst, as we old Commons hands say.","Today, and for many mornings to come, Linda Walker will be waking up in Styal prison, in Cheshire. There are better places to spend a Sunday. Six women killed themselves there in the space of a year and 41 tried to hang themselves over the last Mother's Day weekend. Mrs Walker, 48, is a teacher and head of year at a school for children with behavioural problems. She has a partner who is a college lecturer, twin sons of 17, a daughter and an elderly father for whom she cooks. Last week, she was jailed for six months after carrying out the sort of fantasy to which some liberals furtively confess. She showed the yobs what fear feels like.  In Mrs Walker's account, her house had been under siege. Bicycles were stolen, fish disappeared from the garden pond and wing mirrors were smashed. An abusive caller said her son was a 'poof' and asked: 'Does he want a good bumming?' On 14 August last year, Mrs Walker snapped when a container of liquid was poured over a family car  After haranguing a group of teenagers, she returned home to arm herself with a Walther CP88 gas-powered air pistol, which she had kept in her underwear drawer since a previous burglary, and an air rifle. Pausing only to phone the police to tell them that she was 'going to shoot the f****** vandals', she fired six times at the ground near an 18-year-old youth.  Exit Mrs Walker, her career almost certainly in ruins, complaining that the law supported 'yobbos and not victims'. The court heard later that she had acted in a moment of madness to defend her family. Anyone could write the script from this point onwards. As mainly right-wing newspapers clamoured for her freedom, Michael Howard made her the official martyr of his campaign to 'put fear into the heart of yobs'.  So far, so predictable, except that the Walker case, far from confirming entrenched opinions, confounds many of them. For a start, conservatives are correct to challenge her sentence. Prison is for those whose crimes are so grave or who are such a danger to the public that no other option is possible. Mrs Walker fulfils neither criterion, and, like thousands of other British women, she should not be there.  Harsh sentencing does not, though, excuse her behaviour or explain it. I have just been burgled and my neighbour had her basement stripped bare three days ago. Neither of us felt impelled to add a Terminator-style armoury to our underwear drawers. In her defence, Mrs Walker was reacting against something more insidious. Kierkegaard called anxiety 'the dizziness of freedom', but nothing makes people feel more unfree than being constantly under threat. And so Mrs Walker, a respectable teacher, staged a conversion almost as startling as if Miss Jean Brodie had become a Clockwork Orange droog.  Greater Manchester, where Mrs Walker lives, does not resemble Kubrick's urban nightmare. Indeed, the showcase for the government's anti-yob strategy should be getting safer by the day. No other police force has been so eager to hand out antisocial behaviour orders, making the patch the Home Office's model of good practice. In a six-month period last year, 155 people were Asboed, compared with 27 in Merseyside.  Mrs Walker's story, and her son's claim that she had vainly asked the police 15 times for help,   offers only an isolated example that all is not well in Asboland. But then the government, despite the focus on expanding its crackdown, hasn't been very scientific either. We know that a third of orders are breached and that two-thirds of those sentenced for failing to comply are sent to jail. There are worrying reports of children who are mentally ill or frail being criminalised. But six years and 4,000 orders after the policy's inception, there is not a single longitudinal study to show whether the orders stop bad behaviour or, as many experts on youth crime believe, make it worse.  That question matters more than pre-election chatter allows. The jailing of Linda Walker may be unjust, but it is much less alarming, in the story of badland Britain, than the spate of child offenders currently appearing at the Old Bailey. Last month alone, three schoolboys stood trial for murder there. One in 10 12-year-old boys and a quarter of 16- years-old boys have gone out armed in the last year.  Fear is for bigots and for politicians more adept at conjuring despair than dreams. Michael Howard talks up terror. The Archbishop of Canterbury knocks it down. Liberals, appalled by being asked to beware the gypsy, the asylum seeker, the immigrant and the kid outside the chip shop, think dread a disreputable emotion. But suddenly I am afraid.  My fear began when Hakeem Johnson, aged 13, walked into my local takeaway and stabbed a young manager to death because he would not serve him a £1 pizza after a special offer had ended. I am not personally frightened of Johnson's friends, whom I probably brush past often in the Holloway Road, but I am scared by the statistic that three-quarters of boys excluded from school, as he was, have used a weapon. I am disturbed that a teaching union   has reported a surge in classroom violence, and the government must be anxious, too, because the Schools Minister last week announced a knife amnesty to tackle the 'hugely disturbing' culture of weapons.  But most of all, I am alarmed that, despite the overall fall in crime, a new mood of casual cruelty is fermenting in cities where the problems, and solutions, are mostly arcane and intractable. Atrocious families and deprivation are nothing novel and the government has done some good things to tackle both; 100,000 children lifted out of poverty last year is not enough, but it is slow progress.  So why the knives and the gangs of teenagers practising the elastic-hipped swagger of the pretend assassin? Why the wave of rapes and murders combining adult savagery and the capricious pointlessness of childish rage?  I do not know and nor does the government. But I think, and so do charities working in the field, that a society driving wedges between adult authority and alienated youngsters can only ignite the problem of children who evolve so fast from victims to aggressors.  That is not to suggest that the mean streets of Greater Manchester and elsewhere can be sanitised by a combination of table tennis and a willingness by law-abiding citizens to have their lives made miserable in the interest of community relations. But neither is it right to beat the drum of punishment and exclusion while saying so little about positive intervention.  Linda Walker's jailing was not only extreme. It also helped reinforce the narrative, only patchily accurate, about a middle class terrorised by yobs. Politicians like that story. It strikes a chord with anyone who has had their windows smashed or their geography class made hell. It offers slick solutions to the genuinely persecuted. And it stops anyone asking whether today's tearaways are being officially groomed for tomorrow's knife gangs."
1,"Gordon Brown arrived on the front bench in the Commons, laughing and joking with Tony Blair. Laughing and joking? With Tony Blair? Things must be desperate. The prime minister was about to shaft him. And so he did. Shortly after that he told us to expect a referendum on membership of   the euro within - he implied - two years of the election. The chancellor himself would prefer it some time after a giant meteor has wiped out all life on earth. At least that way he'd know the result in advance.  Step back with me two hours in time, to 1pm yesterday. I was at the Channel 4 Political Awards, to be shown at 8pm on Saturday. It'll be a funny show, so catch it if you can, though it goes out at the same time as Casualty. You might find it hard to tell the difference. (""This man's career is hanging by a thread! We need oxygen, a blood transfusion, and a heart transplant!"" ""But doctor, look, the Mandelson case file says 'do not resuscitate!'"")   At my table was Lembit Opik, the LibDem MP who has spent the last few years telling us that the meteor could strike at any time. I asked if we wouldn't have a few weeks' warning, to send up a nuclear device up to smash the rock before it hits us. He said we might get two minutes. What a cheery companion he proved to be.  Jon Snow, the presenter, made a joke about Michael Meacher ""only stopping by to pick up the rent"". That got a big laugh.  Lembit Opik appeared on camera talking about Gordon Prentice, a keen opponent of fox-hunting. He, Lembit, had suggested to him that it should remain legal, but there should be a regulatory   agency called ""Off-fox"". Mr Prentice had replied ""using the same words, but in the reverse order"".  There were some queeny ""whoo, whoos"" from the assembled pols and hacks, but Gordon Brown looked much amused.  Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing, was briefly fooled on air by a phone call from Tony Blair - actually a member of Radio 4's Dead Ringers team. The prime minister would like to visit his constituency. ""I can promise you no tomatoes,"" said Mr Pound, ""but a few kiwi fruits and aubergines, perhaps...""  The next winner was the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley, for his book about New   Labour and their general contempt for the voters. It is said that Gordon Brown was a source for this work, but now regrets telling the author whatever it was he said.  As the oeuvre was being praised, the chancellor looked thunderous. Margaret Beckett, two seats away, smiled a tight little smile.  Mr Rawnsley praised his wife for all her help. ""She is my rock, my comfort and my joy,"" he said. The chancellor's jaw literally hung open. He hugged himself, like someone signalling the maitre d' to bring a strait jacket.  Then Mr Brown himself won the top award of all, for ""the MP who has been the most outstanding figure in the House"". They showed   short clips of people praising him. He looked delighted. Who wouldn't be? Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews declared on the monitors: ""He is an absolutely typical Lowland Scot. He believes in the virtues of toil, and plunder.""  Back in the Commons, Mr Blair was replying to William Hague. Did an early referendum on the euro mean within two years of the next parliament? (The Tory leader seems to have given up any hope of winning.)  ""Early in the next parliament would, of course, be within two years,"" Mr Blair replied. Mr Brown scowled.  Win some, lose some. But he seems to win nearly all the time, so I don't suppose he'll mind too much.","The Tories are trying to turn Northern Ireland into a party political issue.

You can hardly blame them. The more things deteriorate for the Government, the worse they become for the Tories.

But he seems to win nearly all the time, so I don't suppose he'll mind too much.","In Blandings Castle and Elsewhere, PG Wodehouse recorded the sterling response of Beach, the butler, on discovering Lord Emsworth's son in a drawing room with a sack of rats in his hand. ""With a murmured apology, he secured the sack and started to withdraw. It was not strictly his duty to carry rats, but a good butler is always ready to give and take. Only so can the amenities of a large country house be preserved."" Anyone who has marvelled, in recent days, at the duties routinely performed by Paul Burrell in his days of butling for the Prince and Princess of Wales may find that the Wodehouse passage has lost some of its old impact. They may feel that in comparison with the demands on Burrell's give and take, Beach's was barely tested. For a man, like Burrell, who might, at any time, be ordered to retrieve one of Diana's unwilling lovers from his hiding place in a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet, or have a book thrown at him by Prince Charles as a punishment for second-rate lying, or be despatched to Paddington to stand proxy for the Princess as the saviour of deserving prostitutes, or be sent out by his mistress to buy pornography for her teenage son, the efficient disposal of a sack of rats would probably have presented a nice break from routine. For Burrell's unfortunate colleague, the valet who had to hold Prince Charles's hospital specimen pot while the royal membrum virile pissed into it, rat-securing could only have offered a glimpse of a better, more beautiful life. Of the many unanswered questions currently stacking-up, Sherlock Holmes-fashion, in the wake of the Burrell trial, the most fascinating is not, surely, the issue of why the Queen dallied so long before springing Burrell from the witness box, nor why our senior police investigators are so spectacularly thick, nor what possessed Burrell to remove boxes of old pop CDs, as well as letters, from proximity to those beastly shredding Spencers, but the far more intriguing subject of the Windsors' execrable treatment of their servants. How have they got away with it for so long?  Naturally, confidentiality agreements and the official secrets act have been helpful to the feudal tradition. Had it not been for Burrell's trial, Prince Charles must have felt quite confident that no one would find out that fibbing to his wife formed part of the Highgrove butler's job description. Wendy Berry, who wrote an engrossing account of her servitude at Highgrove (and one which was rather kinder, though otherwise consistent with the subsequently published recollections of Ken Wharfe, the detective, and Patrick Jephson, Diana's secretary) had to flee to America after Prince Charles took out an injunction on her book, one which remains in place, ensuring that no part of it can be quoted. But even with this legal deterrent to gossip, it is remarkable how little, until now, has been disclosed by their servants about the preposterous expectations and demands of members of the royal family.  Most people will have waited until the Burrell trial to discover that Prince Charles is notorious not only for temper tantrums but for the ludicrous and time-wasting requirement, like a child who cannot leave the house without her comfort blanket, that his personal arrangements, even in hospital, should replicate those at Highgrove. Thanks to Burrell, we now know that for the heir to the throne, there can be no disruption without a van-load of transitional objects. Also that this ardent believer in the dignity of mankind prefers, when at home, to recreate the social arrangements of Altman's satire, Gosford Park - a film, incidentally, which Charles has screened for guests at Sandringham: quality in the comfy chairs, servants in the hard ones at the back. Perhaps they were lucky. The Queen, by Burrell's account, prefers the lower orders to stand in her presence, even when, as in his own, notorious case, their encounter lasts for three hours.  As for these bullied butlers and dressers, valets and housemaids, only proximity to power - and, of course, the free accommodation - can explain why so many are content to indulge their masters, remaining mutely loyal, infinitely discreet. For Burrell, Diana's intimacy and trust must have compensated for the dignity he forfeited when she appointed him Rock of the Bedchamber, a sort of gentleman-procurer responsible for delivering her lovers, stowed in a car boot, in and out of Kensington Palace. Similarly, his sovereign's abrupt recollection of their chat - ""the Queen came through for me"" - seems instantly to have made up for her two years of forgetfulness. Those who now condemn Burrell for telling his story should perhaps marvel instead at his forbearance during the many years of being pelted with books by the heir apparent and besieged by out-of-hours calls from the moody princess while unwanted presents from colonial visitors stoked the Highgrove bonfires. Moreover, even as they add to the gaiety of nations, the Burrell confessions may effect some improvement in palace working conditions. Next time some troublesome Helot has him reaching for the nearest, book-shaped missile, the Prince of Wales may want to think twice, and send for a rat sack instead."

'Bullseye!' yelled some ridiculous Labour sycophant.   Betty gently called on Jack to withdraw. 'I withdraw the remark,' he muttered. 'Apologise!' the Tories screamed.   'I apologise,' he mumbled at his chest, in the way which makes every parent yell: 'Say it as if you meant it!' There was a difference, he said, between a judicial inquiry and a 'run-of-the-mill government publication.'  The implication of this, that the Government could leak what it liked when it liked, raised the Tories to new levels of ersatz anger.   David Winnick, Keith Vaz and Diane Abbott tightened the hysterical atmosphere by, in effect, accusing the Conservatives of racism and contempt for the Lawrence family. 'I am disgusted . . . they did nothing about race and racism when they were in power!' said Mr Vaz, as if that had any bearing on Mr Straw's misjudgment.   The House at its very worst, as we old Commons hands say."
0,"The Tories are trying to turn Northern Ireland into a party political issue. They know they shouldn't really, but they just can't stop themselves.

They are like hungry schoolboys. (Mr Hague looks permanently like a hungry schoolboy). They haven't had anything decent to eat since goodness knows when. And there, cooling on the window sill, is a delicious apple pie.

They know they shouldn't take it. They know they'll get into trouble. They know that they'll get stomach pains if they scoff it all. But they cannot help it.

You can hardly blame them. The more things deteriorate for the Government, the worse they become for the Tories. Just when Mr Hague must have thought that his job couldn't get any more horrible, someone leaked a story that he intends to sack the older half of his shadow cabinet, so he has had to spend the last 48 hours desperately sucking up to that collection of misfits, malfeasors and ghouls. (To quote Jeremy Hardy, if they'd all been born in the same village, you'd blame pollution in the water supply.)

Not that Northern Ireland isn't a legitimate subject. Not that the Government is definitely right in an appallingly difficult judgment call. It's just that for 30 years the general view at Westminster has been that however awful our opponents are, the IRA and the paramilitaries are a thousand times worse, so we'd better stick together.

Mr Hague asked six long questions yesterday and got six equally long answers. He seemed to be convinced that Mr Blair was trying to prevent him from raising the issue. He was copying those pork-pie hatted columnists in the old-fashioned tabloids: ''The Man They Cannot Gag!''

For his part, Mr Blair seemed wounded. He accepted that the process was imperfect and the peace it had created was imperfect. ''But it is better than no process and no peace at all.''

The Tory Government had had to make difficult judgments too. ''They were in secret negotiations with the IRA, denied they were doing so, came to the House and admitted it, and when they did so, not one of us complained, because we knew how difficult the process was.''

''Opposition members may complain!'' said Mr Hague, waving his arm at the Labour benches. Did he imagine, subconsciously, that his party was still in power? Or had he realised that there was precious little opposition to be found on his own side?

Mr Blair warned about ''the enormous consequences'' of interrupting the process now. ''Peace in our time!'' said Mr Michael Fabricant, annoyingly, since Mr Blair is no Neville Chamberlain, and because Mickey, just back from Australia, has an alarmingly tanned face and something I have never seen before, a tanned wig on top of it.

Mr Blair has often been lucky in his opponents, and the lingering rancour was soon dispelled by Teresa Gorman, who rose to quote pessimistic union leaders on the state of the economy. Mr Edmonds of the G&B had been critical. So had ''Mr Bill Morris of the, er, G. T. W. U. M . . .'' 

Mrs Gorman continued with a random selection from the alphabet, like an Enigma machine preparing for Arnhem. As MPs chortled, she said firmly: ''Mr Morris, the leader of one of our major unions!''

'''Ave another G&T'' growled Dennis Skinner. (Or some more HRT, he might have added.)

Someone complained that William Hague had taken up too much time. The Speaker agreed. ''The questions are too long, and the answers are too long,'' she said crisply.

This is the closest she has ever come to a full frontal attack on the Prime Minister. Sadly, he was not there to hear it, having scarpered the moment he could. Mr Blair does not believe in spending a moment longer in the Chamber than is absolutely necessary.","Republicans are, or ought to be, against the monarchy on principle. The extravagant lifestyle of the royal family and the louche behaviour of wastrel princelings prejudice the public against the House of Windsor. But the only important argument concerns blood and birth. It is neither right nor reasonable that, at the beginning of the 21st century, heredity should determine who becomes the head of state. Elizabeth the Circumspect is as much an anachronism as her uncle Edward the Irresponsible would be today. There was a time when monarchists held the mirror image of that view. The case for the crown was, they insisted, unrelated to the character and conduct of the king or queen or the cost of the court. We used to be told that the monarch herself believed that she was the Lord's Anointed and that, orb and sceptre in hand, she had accepted God's invitation long to reign over us. A queen who imagines that she is personally ordained by the Almighty does not bother about the cost of an occasional journey by royal train.  If the Queen still holds that view - rather than the suspicion that she occupies the throne on sufferance - she should tell Alan Reid, the keeper of the privy purse, about it. When the cost of the royal household was revealed last week, he defended an annual expenditure of more than £36m in language that would have been entirely appropriate to a Subaru salesman confronting a sceptical customer.  ""We believe this represents a value-for-money monarchy. We are not looking to provide the cheapest monarchy. We are looking at one of good value and good quality."" Delete ""monarchy"", insert ""motorcar"" and the explanation could easily have been expressed on the forecourt of a suburban showroom. If this is the case for the monarchy, we are entitled to ask how many miles there are on the Queen's clock and if she is still in full working order.   It is easy to argue that an expenditure of £3m a month does not amount to a ""cost-effective"" head of state. An elected president - without a family to support in the manner to which the Duke of York has grown accustomed - would certainly cost less. But the important aspect of the dubious claim is its lese-majesty, not its accuracy. Once the monarchy feels it necessary to justify its existence in prosaic terms, the argument for monarchy collapses.  The superstition, on which the theory of hereditary succession is based, insists that the royal family is different from the rest of us. No sensible person argues that the Prince of Wales should ascend to the throne because he is an expert onarchitecture, education or   any of the other subjects about which he pontificates. Indeed, it is usually accepted that his opinions are embarrassingly silly. They are reprinted for exactly the same reason that it is assumed that one day he will be king. He is said to have inherent qualities that set him apart from his future subjects. It is that, not his financial prudence, which make him heir apparent.  Walter Bagehot claimed that the strength of the British monarchy lay in its ability to inspire ""the feelings by which heroic kings governed their rude age"" and, at the same time, experience ""the feelings by which the constitutions of later Greece ruled in more refined ages"". Neither of those lofty attributes encompassed the desperate desire to win the support of tabloid newspapers. Quite the opposite. Yet last week that aspiration was taken to risible extremes.  The ghost of Queen Victoria will find it difficult to believe that, after the cost of the court was published, Buckingham Palace issued a   detailed breakdown of the consumption patterns at royal garden parties. The £500,000 a year that the Queen spends on these occasions is, apparently, partly due to the gluttony of the guests - each of whom, on average, consumes 14 buns, bridge rolls and ice creams. A spokesman, demonstrating a grasp of arithmetic that is beyond question, pointed out that if the average is 14, some people ate even more. One of the ways of cutting the royal budget is, as Marie Antoinette failed to recognise, ""let them eat less cake"".  Even today, a monarchy can survive being hated or despised. But being the object of ridicule is lethal. However, our laughter ought to be moderated by compassion. The royal family faces an intolerable choice. Were the Queen to say - as Queen Victoria would have said - that the royal accounts were none of the common people's business, she would be excoriated for her arrogance. Yet, when she allowed her courtiers to justify the way in which she spends her money, the myth of monarchy is destroyed.  It is impossible to have a monarchy that is simultaneously regal and human. Pity their dilemma. And remember that a monarchy which is patronised with pity must, in the long run, be doomed."
1,"We're losing the art of public interaction. The spaces - from a public park to a forum for public exchange - where social debate and contemplation can take place are eroding before our eyes. Two very disparate and under-reported initiatives were launched last week, both rooted in this concern - precursors perhaps of the beginning of civil society's fight back. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) delivered its manifesto for better public spaces, saying that a combination of powerful private interests, aggressive litigiousness and timidity by public authorities were together undermining public space.  Suffolk County Council's infamous decision to outlaw hanging baskets from some lampposts in Bury St Edmunds is the most graphic example of the general trend. Fear that the baskets might fall and hurt someone, sparking an expensive compensation claim, had forced the county council to act. Nor is it an idle fear. Manchester City Council's budget for compensation claims now exceeds its budget for repairing pavements - also, ironically, the source of many claims for compensation.  All around the country, according to Cabe, boating lakes, markets, adventure playgrounds, and public parks are under growing threat because they are deemed too risky in the face of claims for compensation from some aggrieved injured litigant or that they are too expensive to protect from the ambitions of private developers - and there is too little protest about the wider cost to us of access being reduced or even phased out altogether.  Yet there is a wealth of evidence that being able to stroll in a park and breathe good air prolongs life expectancy; that having somewhere to play reduces kids' obesity; that having wide pavements and well-lit bus stops reduces crime. It is worth paying to have park keepers, finding funds to pay compensation and imposing the planning controls to protect public space. Such things enhance our lives. By refusing to pay for our public sphere we collude in undermining it.  The Royal Society of Arts is worried that our well-being is under equal pressure from another source. We are losing the capacity to engage in anything other than private conversation about private passions; even public debate is increasingly about our private loves, hates and emotions - and when public debate is about something public, say the European constitution, or even the decline in public space, it is conducted in a way designed not to illuminate or inform.  There is certainly no dialogue; it is two sides duelling, holding their views with unshakeable and unchanging conviction, giving no quarter and spinning every fact with a vengeance, with the   public cast as onlookers to a gladiatorial spectacle. Their role is to enjoy the sparks rather than learn or modify their opinions in the light of the evidence.  The RSA's response is to launch a national series of coffee-house debates based on the coffee-house out of which it was born 250 years ago.  It wants to recreate the capacity to be engaged in public affairs, and that means, believes Britain's most venerable think-tank, that we need to acquire again the art of thinking aloud about public issues in an environment where you are not pounced on for making a mistake, not toeing the party line or excoriated for saying something illogical.  Creative conversation, when it happens, is intoxicating; interlocuters inspire and fire new thoughts in each other. Let us hope that we all know this sensation; but nobody would say good conversation characterises our current public realm. The Royal Society wants us to talk in today's coffee-houses - 500 Starbucks - and email them the results of our conversations.  I welcome both initiatives. We are locked in a vicious circle, in which declining public space begets the very excessive individualism that feeds self-interested litigiousness and the bear-baiting, take-no-prisoners attitude towards public debate.  What drives the compensation culture is the decline in people's sense of belonging to a wider public culture. This fuels a disproportionate sense of personal injury - along with the prospect of some easy money.  Equally, media interviews where the interviewer sets out to entrap and draw blood do nothing to enlarge public understanding - but that is because the listener and viewer collude in seeing the Minister, MP or official in the same way as the media. That is, not as legitimate representatives of a public realm that can only be sustained in the last resort if we respect it; rather, as somebody we want to see discomfited or commit a gaffe. Public life has become a kind of soap opera in which issues are less important than the private foibles, wobbles and passions of the actors in the drama.  Charles Kennedy's sweating or Michael Portillo's gay experiences are one part of this - the other is extraordinary over-exaggeration. There are 12 weeks to stop a European superstate; MMR vaccine causes autism; the Six Nations rugby tournament is bankrupt as a sports spectacle. Choose your issue and you know what I mean.  Even as I write this I'm aware of the counter arguments; the public parks I know well seem in rude good health. And if some toffs are complaining about the vulgarity and prurience of the British media, it was ever thus. The greater truth is its vitality - and people have the wit to see through the hype. Public debate is always going to be edgy with debaters probing for any advantage they can; to imagine it should be conducted as some glorified seminar is to bay for the moon.  And why shouldn't we be interested in the personal dimensions of our public figures?  And yet I stick to my guns. There is a rise in the compensation culture and there is a degradation in how public argument is conducted. What connects them both is a diminishing sense of why what we hold in common is as important to our well-being as the freedom to pursue our self-interest and accent only the personal. And this disappearing collectivity is, for example, why the BBC is under assault; it is why, in a larger sense, we are so bad-tempered and ill at ease with ourselves.  But the desire for better co-exists with the same trends. Thus Cabe and the RSA last week. Thus the polls that simultaneously show huge support for the BBC even while it is denigrated. Thus the periodic interest in the idea of new newspapers (the latest is Stephen Glover's the  World) which are built on public interest and impartial news journalism.  Such tensions are a feature of the age. The idea of 'the public' is too weak. It is only if we recognise that and fight back to restore its place that we have any hope of reasserting the values that are, literally, good for us all.  I am on the side of those who want to fight back.","These are fearful times. The fall in the birth rate across the West is testimony to a growing pessimism about the future; the menaces that together seem to make the good life unattainable range from fear that science is running amok to terrorism and climate change. Live for today and don't have children is a rallying cry finding more adherents.The world is not a pleasant place and seems to be getting less pleasant fast. Above all else, we seem powerless to control and shape these forces; they exist as ominous influences that can no longer be contained.In this sense, the very idea of progress is now contested. No contemporary historians would trace British history, Macaulay-like, as an account of how democracy, the rule of law and the extension of British values have steadily increased their influence. We have no Sidney and Beatrice Webb dedicated to the possibility of social improvement. We have no Nye Bevan who can convince us that political action can shape the world.There is no Keynes to guide our economic thinking. There are no inventors or scientists so celebrated that when they die, London's streets would throng with mourners, as they did for Brunel and Stephenson in the nineteenth century.  Instead, there is a rise in credulity accompanied by an insistence that we must not meddle with natural verities. Religious fundamentalism, in the Christian and Islamic worlds alike, insists that religious texts should be interpreted literally. Christian creationists, arguing that God and not natural selection created the world, find a market as ready for their views as their counterparts in Islam.There is a small industry attacking the very idea of scientific method; for it, there is no objective material reality and the search to discover, explain and master the natural world has reached the ethical and moral limits. From now on, warn writers such as Francis Fukuyama, science is taking us into territory where it sets up men as gods able to manipulate the very marrow of humanity.This veneration of nature and suspicion of human agency makes conservatives of Right and Left alike. Political activism, even when allegedly radical, is imbued with a conservative streak. What is held out as the desirable norm is some Elysian state of nature in which there are no GM crops, only sustainable energy use, science is caged and communities are self-sustaining, trading as little as possible with the outside world. Prince Charles and the Greens make common purpose.This seeps into how we feel about social experimentation generally. New ways of teaching, of parenting, of living with other races are frowned on. We must stick to natural rules. David Goodhart, a liberal intellectual, wins an astonishing number of column inches arguing that as we prefer to associate with our own, there is a necessary and inevitable trade-off between solidarity and diversity.When the Left criticises Blair and New Labour for their lack of radicalism and their caution, it rarely places the criticism in this wider context. A progressive party can't flourish in an environment where the currents feeding progressivism are in retreat. The character of politics has a symbiotic relationship with the society of which it is part. If the cultural, intellectual and social forces that underpin progressive politics are themselves challenged, even the most inspired political leadership will only change matters at the margin. It's a fair complaint that New Labour attempts that only fitfully, but let's put the complaint into context.Blair and Brown are more conscious of this missing component of the progressive project than most commentators concede and Brown, particularly, thinks deeply about how to resurrect some confidence in the idea of progress. Which is why his breakfast meeting last week with 30 leaders of Britain's scientific community was of more importance than just to British science. Brown, and Blair for that matter, not only see British scientists as a core part of the New Labour progressive coalition, they see a revival of science and recovery of its self-belief as a handmaiden for advancing the economy and the idea of progress.Brown committed to a 10-year build up of investment in Britain's science infrastructure which will be the centrepiece of this summer's comprehensive spending review. He wants the share of GDP devoted to scientific research to rise towards the top of the international league table. He wants more collaboration between universities and business; more scientists and more science taught in schools, reversing the alarming decline in scientific GCSE and A-levels over the last 15 years.Moreover, the Government is prepared to take risks to make researchers feel that Britain is science-friendly; it countenances stem-cell research, wants to agree wider trials with GM food and will have no truck with the anti-vivisection movement. More investment is being accompanied by a cultural commitment to science; here, the Government shows a leadership that eludes it over Europe and the euro or the case for higher taxation.Which is all to the good, but I fear it underestimates the scale of the task. In the nineteenth century and for a good part of the twentieth, science was underpinned by a widespread understanding that it underwrote progress and prosperity alike. The shrinking of Britain's manufacturing base means that the number of sizable science-based companies hardly extends beyond aerospace and pharmaceuticals.  Today's prosperity is built on a credit-backed consumer boom and a service-sector economy that push forward independently of the state of science. In the US, some of the most dynamic parts of the country are the new 'ideopolises', where science-based universities spearhead the growth of new industries; apart from Cambridge, there are no British ideopolises, although Manchester has ambitions.But we need not just companies and parts of Britain which we can hold up as exemplars of the prosperity science can bring. We need a wider cultural acceptance that where science is currently taking us - understanding the building blocks on which life is constructed - is not terrifying but exhilarating.While scientific method does work to push back the frontiers of knowledge, it is also true that we need ever more robust mechanisms to discuss its implications and ensure that the benefits are universally shared and ethical risks universally guarded against.Science, paradoxically, has always flowered best when society has a strong public realm which allows it to have confidence that science ultimately can be made to serve us rather than be used against us - the fear of those who want to ban stem-cell research, cloning and GM foods.  Today's public realm is shrivelled and under siege; it, too, needs to be shored up. To revive the idea of progress is to revive the public realm that allows us to shape the world, rather than be shaped by it. New Labour is undertaking a proper fight, but it needs to think much bigger if it wants to win it."

Things must be desperate. The prime minister was about to shaft him. And so he did. Shortly after that he told us to expect a referendum on membership of   the euro within - he implied - two years of the election. The chancellor himself would prefer it some time after a giant meteor has wiped out all life on earth. At least that way he'd know the result in advance.  Step back with me two hours in time, to 1pm yesterday. I was at the Channel 4 Political Awards, to be shown at 8pm on Saturday. It'll be a funny show, so catch it if you can, though it goes out at the same time as Casualty. You might find it hard to tell the difference. (""This man's career is hanging by a thread! We need oxygen, a blood transfusion, and a heart transplant!"" ""But doctor, look, the Mandelson case file says 'do not resuscitate!'"")   At my table was Lembit Opik, the LibDem MP who has spent the last few years telling us that the meteor could strike at any time. I asked if we wouldn't have a few weeks' warning, to send up a nuclear device up to smash the rock before it hits us. He said we might get two minutes. What a cheery companion he proved to be.  Jon Snow, the presenter, made a joke about Michael Meacher ""only stopping by to pick up the rent"". That got a big laugh.  Lembit Opik appeared on camera talking about Gordon Prentice, a keen opponent of fox-hunting. He, Lembit, had suggested to him that it should remain legal, but there should be a regulatory   agency called ""Off-fox"". Mr Prentice had replied ""using the same words, but in the reverse order"".  There were some queeny ""whoo, whoos"" from the assembled pols and hacks, but Gordon Brown looked much amused.  Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing, was briefly fooled on air by a phone call from Tony Blair - actually a member of Radio 4's Dead Ringers team. The prime minister would like to visit his constituency. ""I can promise you no tomatoes,"" said Mr Pound, ""but a few kiwi fruits and aubergines, perhaps...""  The next winner was the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley, for his book about New   Labour and their general contempt for the voters. It is said that Gordon Brown was a source for this work, but now regrets telling the author whatever it was he said.  As the oeuvre was being praised, the chancellor looked thunderous. Margaret Beckett, two seats away, smiled a tight little smile.  Mr Rawnsley praised his wife for all her help. ""She is my rock, my comfort and my joy,"" he said. The chancellor's jaw literally hung open. He hugged himself, like someone signalling the maitre d' to bring a strait jacket.  Then Mr Brown himself won the top award of all, for ""the MP who has been the most outstanding figure in the House"". They showed   short clips of people praising him. He looked delighted. Who wouldn't be? Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews declared on the monitors: ""He is an absolutely typical Lowland Scot. He believes in the virtues of toil, and plunder.""  Back in the Commons, Mr Blair was replying to William Hague. Did an early referendum on the euro mean within two years of the next parliament? (The Tory leader seems to have given up any hope of winning.)  ""Early in the next parliament would, of course, be within two years,"" Mr Blair replied. Mr Brown scowled.  Win some, lose some. But he seems to win nearly all the time, so I don't suppose he'll mind too much."

Brown, and Blair for that matter, not only see British scientists as a core part of the New Labour progressive coalition, they see a revival of science and recovery of its self-belief as a handmaiden for advancing the economy and the idea of progress.Brown committed to a 10-year build up of investment in Britain's science infrastructure which will be the centrepiece of this summer's comprehensive spending review. He wants the share of GDP devoted to scientific research to rise towards the top of the international league table. He wants more collaboration between universities and business; more scientists and more science taught in schools, reversing the alarming decline in scientific GCSE and A-levels over the last 15 years.Moreover, the Government is prepared to take risks to make researchers feel that Britain is science-friendly; it countenances stem-cell research, wants to agree wider trials with GM food and will have no truck with the anti-vivisection movement. More investment is being accompanied by a cultural commitment to science; here, the Government shows a leadership that eludes it over Europe and the euro or the case for higher taxation.Which is all to the good, but I fear it underestimates the scale of the task. In the nineteenth century and for a good part of the twentieth, science was underpinned by a widespread understanding that it underwrote progress and prosperity alike. The shrinking of Britain's manufacturing base means that the number of sizable science-based companies hardly extends beyond aerospace and pharmaceuticals.  Today's prosperity is built on a credit-backed consumer boom and a service-sector economy that push forward independently of the state of science. In the US, some of the most dynamic parts of the country are the new 'ideopolises', where science-based universities spearhead the growth of new industries; apart from Cambridge, there are no British ideopolises, although Manchester has ambitions.But we need not just companies and parts of Britain which we can hold up as exemplars of the prosperity science can bring. We need a wider cultural acceptance that where science is currently taking us - understanding the building blocks on which life is constructed - is not terrifying but exhilarating.While scientific method does work to push back the frontiers of knowledge, it is also true that we need ever more robust mechanisms to discuss its implications and ensure that the benefits are universally shared and ethical risks universally guarded against.Science, paradoxically, has always flowered best when society has a strong public realm which allows it to have confidence that science ultimately can be made to serve us rather than be used against us - the fear of those who want to ban stem-cell research, cloning and GM foods.  Today's public realm is shrivelled and under siege; it, too, needs to be shored up. To revive the idea of progress is to revive the public realm that allows us to shape the world, rather than be shaped by it. New Labour is undertaking a proper fight, but it needs to think much bigger if it wants to win it.","We're losing the art of public interaction. The spaces - from a public park to a forum for public exchange - where social debate and contemplation can take place are eroding before our eyes. Two very disparate and under-reported initiatives were launched last week, both rooted in this concern - precursors perhaps of the beginning of civil society's fight back. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) delivered its manifesto for better public spaces, saying that a combination of powerful private interests, aggressive litigiousness and timidity by public authorities were together undermining public space.  Suffolk County Council's infamous decision to outlaw hanging baskets from some lampposts in Bury St Edmunds is the most graphic example of the general trend. Fear that the baskets might fall and hurt someone, sparking an expensive compensation claim, had forced the county council to act. Nor is it an idle fear. Manchester City Council's budget for compensation claims now exceeds its budget for repairing pavements - also, ironically, the source of many claims for compensation.  All around the country, according to Cabe, boating lakes, markets, adventure playgrounds, and public parks are under growing threat because they are deemed too risky in the face of claims for compensation from some aggrieved injured litigant or that they are too expensive to protect from the ambitions of private developers - and there is too little protest about the wider cost to us of access being reduced or even phased out altogether.  Yet there is a wealth of evidence that being able to stroll in a park and breathe good air prolongs life expectancy; that having somewhere to play reduces kids' obesity; that having wide pavements and well-lit bus stops reduces crime. It is worth paying to have park keepers, finding funds to pay compensation and imposing the planning controls to protect public space. Such things enhance our lives. By refusing to pay for our public sphere we collude in undermining it.  The Royal Society of Arts is worried that our well-being is under equal pressure from another source. We are losing the capacity to engage in anything other than private conversation about private passions; even public debate is increasingly about our private loves, hates and emotions - and when public debate is about something public, say the European constitution, or even the decline in public space, it is conducted in a way designed not to illuminate or inform.  There is certainly no dialogue; it is two sides duelling, holding their views with unshakeable and unchanging conviction, giving no quarter and spinning every fact with a vengeance, with the   public cast as onlookers to a gladiatorial spectacle. Their role is to enjoy the sparks rather than learn or modify their opinions in the light of the evidence.  The RSA's response is to launch a national series of coffee-house debates based on the coffee-house out of which it was born 250 years ago.  It wants to recreate the capacity to be engaged in public affairs, and that means, believes Britain's most venerable think-tank, that we need to acquire again the art of thinking aloud about public issues in an environment where you are not pounced on for making a mistake, not toeing the party line or excoriated for saying something illogical.  Creative conversation, when it happens, is intoxicating; interlocuters inspire and fire new thoughts in each other. Let us hope that we all know this sensation; but nobody would say good conversation characterises our current public realm. The Royal Society wants us to talk in today's coffee-houses - 500 Starbucks - and email them the results of our conversations.  I welcome both initiatives. We are locked in a vicious circle, in which declining public space begets the very excessive individualism that feeds self-interested litigiousness and the bear-baiting, take-no-prisoners attitude towards public debate.  What drives the compensation culture is the decline in people's sense of belonging to a wider public culture. This fuels a disproportionate sense of personal injury - along with the prospect of some easy money.  Equally, media interviews where the interviewer sets out to entrap and draw blood do nothing to enlarge public understanding - but that is because the listener and viewer collude in seeing the Minister, MP or official in the same way as the media. That is, not as legitimate representatives of a public realm that can only be sustained in the last resort if we respect it; rather, as somebody we want to see discomfited or commit a gaffe. Public life has become a kind of soap opera in which issues are less important than the private foibles, wobbles and passions of the actors in the drama.  Charles Kennedy's sweating or Michael Portillo's gay experiences are one part of this - the other is extraordinary over-exaggeration. There are 12 weeks to stop a European superstate; MMR vaccine causes autism; the Six Nations rugby tournament is bankrupt as a sports spectacle. Choose your issue and you know what I mean.  Even as I write this I'm aware of the counter arguments; the public parks I know well seem in rude good health. And if some toffs are complaining about the vulgarity and prurience of the British media, it was ever thus. The greater truth is its vitality - and people have the wit to see through the hype. Public debate is always going to be edgy with debaters probing for any advantage they can; to imagine it should be conducted as some glorified seminar is to bay for the moon.  And why shouldn't we be interested in the personal dimensions of our public figures?  And yet I stick to my guns. There is a rise in the compensation culture and there is a degradation in how public argument is conducted. What connects them both is a diminishing sense of why what we hold in common is as important to our well-being as the freedom to pursue our self-interest and accent only the personal. And this disappearing collectivity is, for example, why the BBC is under assault; it is why, in a larger sense, we are so bad-tempered and ill at ease with ourselves.  But the desire for better co-exists with the same trends. Thus Cabe and the RSA last week. Thus the polls that simultaneously show huge support for the BBC even while it is denigrated. Thus the periodic interest in the idea of new newspapers (the latest is Stephen Glover's the  World) which are built on public interest and impartial news journalism.  Such tensions are a feature of the age. The idea of 'the public' is too weak. It is only if we recognise that and fight back to restore its place that we have any hope of reasserting the values that are, literally, good for us all.  I am on the side of those who want to fight back."
0,"These are fearful times. The fall in the birth rate across the West is testimony to a growing pessimism about the future; the menaces that together seem to make the good life unattainable range from fear that science is running amok to terrorism and climate change. Live for today and don't have children is a rallying cry finding more adherents.The world is not a pleasant place and seems to be getting less pleasant fast. Above all else, we seem powerless to control and shape these forces; they exist as ominous influences that can no longer be contained.In this sense, the very idea of progress is now contested. No contemporary historians would trace British history, Macaulay-like, as an account of how democracy, the rule of law and the extension of British values have steadily increased their influence. We have no Sidney and Beatrice Webb dedicated to the possibility of social improvement. We have no Nye Bevan who can convince us that political action can shape the world.There is no Keynes to guide our economic thinking. There are no inventors or scientists so celebrated that when they die, London's streets would throng with mourners, as they did for Brunel and Stephenson in the nineteenth century.  Instead, there is a rise in credulity accompanied by an insistence that we must not meddle with natural verities. Religious fundamentalism, in the Christian and Islamic worlds alike, insists that religious texts should be interpreted literally. Christian creationists, arguing that God and not natural selection created the world, find a market as ready for their views as their counterparts in Islam.There is a small industry attacking the very idea of scientific method; for it, there is no objective material reality and the search to discover, explain and master the natural world has reached the ethical and moral limits. From now on, warn writers such as Francis Fukuyama, science is taking us into territory where it sets up men as gods able to manipulate the very marrow of humanity.This veneration of nature and suspicion of human agency makes conservatives of Right and Left alike. Political activism, even when allegedly radical, is imbued with a conservative streak. What is held out as the desirable norm is some Elysian state of nature in which there are no GM crops, only sustainable energy use, science is caged and communities are self-sustaining, trading as little as possible with the outside world. Prince Charles and the Greens make common purpose.This seeps into how we feel about social experimentation generally. New ways of teaching, of parenting, of living with other races are frowned on. We must stick to natural rules. David Goodhart, a liberal intellectual, wins an astonishing number of column inches arguing that as we prefer to associate with our own, there is a necessary and inevitable trade-off between solidarity and diversity.When the Left criticises Blair and New Labour for their lack of radicalism and their caution, it rarely places the criticism in this wider context. A progressive party can't flourish in an environment where the currents feeding progressivism are in retreat. The character of politics has a symbiotic relationship with the society of which it is part. If the cultural, intellectual and social forces that underpin progressive politics are themselves challenged, even the most inspired political leadership will only change matters at the margin. It's a fair complaint that New Labour attempts that only fitfully, but let's put the complaint into context.Blair and Brown are more conscious of this missing component of the progressive project than most commentators concede and Brown, particularly, thinks deeply about how to resurrect some confidence in the idea of progress.

Hang Saddam, says almost everyone. The gallows is not an option for Maxine Carr, who is due out of jail next May. The relatively minor nature of her sin, a crime of lies and silence, has not prevented Maxine-haters placing her in a continuum of female she-devils stretching from Medea to Myra. As the great Judaeo-Christian feast approaches, the polarity between good and evil is stark. In modern replays of the Book of Genesis, conducted in settings as diverse as the Old Bailey, a spider hole near Tikrit and your local Odeon, light does not often vanquish darkness. For happy endings, try Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy at the National Theatre or Tolkien's Return of the King.  In real life, evil prevails. Despite George W. Bush's masterclasses on the subject, there is no particular hierarchy of monsterdom. Michael Jackson, facing child sex-abuse charges, may get a politer welcome on his planned visit to the UK than the one extended to the God-fearing President of the United States. Nor is there an obvious logic to the way we treat untouchables.  Saddam's capture inspired a desire for vengeance, certainly, but also an uneasy pity. The dead eyes and prophet's beard drove commentators to plunder the Old and New Testaments as thoroughly as Bush's speechwriters in an effort to discover what their unexpected sympathy represented. The non-religious answer is what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil.  Tyrants and murderers are defined not only by evidence of their actions - in Saddam's case, the toll of Kurdish citizens gassed and of skulls scratched up from mass graves - but by a cruelty of the imagination. Myths of how maniacal despots behave sit uneasily with Saddam's domestic inventory: one can of 7 Up, a bottle of Lacoste Pour Homme cologne, minted toothpicks, Maxwell House coffee and a picture inscribed 'God Bless Our Home'.  The humdrum detail that jars the observer out of unadulterated hatred also operated in the case of Ian Huntley. His conviction for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman was a restrained affair, free of mobs storming the courtroom precinct or screaming 'Kill Him', in an echo of Tyburn. There was little sign of the bloodlust that followed the Moors Murders and the sentencing of James Bulger's killers. Yet few murders have transfixed Britain, and the world, like those of Holly and Jessica.  Their deaths fed a fear corroding society. If two little girls in smalltown England could be lured to their deaths by a trusted neighbour, then no son or daughter is safe. But more than one child is slaughtered every week by a parent and no one notices. Skewed notions of risk are driven by rare crimes and normally articulated in mob venom.  One reason for a more subdued response might be the dignity of the Chapman and the Wells families, who forbore to demand vengeance. In addition, people do not know, and perhaps never will, exactly how the children died. But those facts do not explain why Huntley has escaped bestial status. I asked a hairdresser friend who has been canvassing her clients. 'It's because he looks so normal,' they told her.  Presentability served Huntley well. His convincing manner persuaded underage girls to have sex with him and prosecutors to ignore their cries of rape. The post-trial furore has been directed at police error in logging past complaints against him, but this is not primarily a scandal of bad filing. The lack of heed paid to his record reflects a society that extended more credence and legal rights to plausible men than to abused girls. Even now, if a case is to succeed, prosecutors prefer their victims dead.  The authorities and the public want child molesters to look like proper perverts, in the mould of a snaggle-toothed Roy Whiting, Sarah Payne's murderer, who appeared in the Sun last week under the headline 'Grinning Creature'. Resembling Jack Nicholson in the latter stages of The Shining saves confusion. Irrespective of bureaucratic bungling by police, Whiting was never school caretaker material. He is separate, a monstrous other who, unlike Huntley or Saddam, holds no Caliban's mirror up to the virtuous world. Pious people, along with neglectful officials and prurient newspapers, need not worry about the thin dividing line between the demon and the normal citizen.  Since the Soham trial lacked a monster from central casting, Maxine Carr gets the role. A fellow prisoner has thrown boiling water at her, and the media hold her guilty of murder by proxy. On the night of the killings, Carr was at a party. The outing might, her critics claim, have pushed a jealous Huntley over the brink. 'Kiss of death' screamed the headline over a picture of her embracing a fellow reveller.  That snapshot in a Grimsby disco placed Carr in a pantheon of female monsters, ranging from the Harpies and the Sirens of Greek legend to Rose West. In myth and in distorted reality, women, deadlier than the male, occupy a spectrum between psychopathy and culpability for engineering family breakdown and producing delinquent children. Carr, branded the 'new Myra' and the catalysing agent of evil, was actually a liar whose mistake was to shack up with a murderer.  In being duped by Huntley's charm, she resembled the police, the school staff, the community and the two trusting girls he murdered. She behaved as others might, and for that reminder of our fallibility, more than her mendacity, she can never be forgiven. In a universe where religious language and political discourse collide, Carr is banished forever from the civilised world to reside with the ranks of the dark forces. Their quarters are becoming more cramped than Saddam's bunker.  The expanding army of darkness encompasses murderers and their gullible girlfriends, along with leaders of Iran and North Korea, the shapeless prosecutors of terror and the suspects interned without charge at Guantanamo and Belmarsh. Arbitrary polarities of good and evil, patented by politicians, mesh with a vengefulness in public thinking.  The capital punishment debate stirs again. Huntley should be executed, according to the string-'em-up lobby whose ambitions will never be heeded by any mainstream political party. Hanging Saddam, however, is deemed perfectly acceptable in Downing Street and the impeccably liberal leader columns of the Independent.  Merciful democrats cannot have it both ways. Certainly, Saddam should be tried in Iraq, but for Britain to rubber-stamp a death sentence would be disgraceful buck-passing by an occupying power which must now stand by its principles. Either we support what David Blunkett calls 'judicial murder' or we recognise that the first test of a humane society is the way it treats the most hideous.  Saddam, like Huntley, should spend his life in prison. There they can suffer for their crimes while offering an enduring reminder to those who once armed a tyrant and failed to stop a potential murderer. Denouncing evil is easy. How much harder to recognise that monsters, with their French cologne and high street clothes, not only share our tastes. Good societies must also shoulder some fragment of their guilt."
1,"The most interesting aspect of France's BSE scandal is that it makes no sense at all. Britain stopped exporting contaminated cattle feed to Europe in 1991 (though we continued sending it to the third world until 1996). In most other EU countries cases have already peaked and declined, as expected. But in France, the number of infected animals has doubled in the last year. It is impossible to see how this pattern could result from the export of British bone meal. The simple fact is that the transmission of BSE has never been satisfactorily explained by the prevailing theory. The consumption of meat and bone meal from infected cows has doubtless had an important role to play. Yet this explanation alone fails to account for the huge numbers of cattle in Britain which continued to become infected after most contaminated feed had been removed from the food chain. The latest research on the human form of the disease, nvCJD, published three weeks ago, failed to find any link with the consumption of infected beef.  You might have imagined that when its theory isn't working, a government would wish to test the alternatives. But the British administration has, so far, sought only to attack a hypothesis which does appear to fit the facts. Since 1988, a Somerset farmer called Mark Purdey has been arguing that scientists have overlooked the root causes of BSE. Self-taught and self- financed, he has mastered the brain's complex biochemical pathways and this year published a groundbreaking paper in a respected medical journal. His reward is to have been reviled, misrepresented and physically attacked.  Prions, the brain proteins whose alteration seems to be responsible for BSE, are designed to protect the brain from the oxidising properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultra- violet light, Purdey argues. When, he suggests, the prion proteins are exposed to too little copper and too much manganese, the manganese takes the place of the copper the prion normally binds to. This means that the protein becomes distorted and loses its function.   BSE arose in British herds during the 1980s, Mark Purdey asserts, because the Ministry of Agriculture started forcing all cattle farmers to treat their animals with an organophosphate pesticide called phosmet, at far higher doses than are used elsewhere in the world. The pesticide had to be poured along the line of the spinal cord. Phosmet, Purdey has shown, captures copper. At the same time, cattle feed was being supplemented with chicken manure, from birds dosed with manganese to increase their egg yield. The prion proteins in the cows' brains were   both deprived of copper and dosed with manganese. In France, the use of phosmet first became mandatory in Brittany. Twenty of the country's initial 28 cases of BSE emerged there. BSE's subsequent spread, Purdey maintains, mirrors the use of the pesticide.  Poisoning by similar means may explain the distribution of the human form of the disease. Of the two main clusters in Britain one, in Kent, is in the middle of a fruit and hop growing area where huge quantities of both organophosphates and manganese-based fungicides are used. The other is in Queniborough in Leicestershire, whose dyeworks (until they caught fire a few years ago, spraying chemicals over the village) used to dump some of their residues into the sewage system, Purdey alleges. The sewage was spread over the fields. Dyeworks use shedloads of manganese.  Purdey has tested his theory on BSE and CJD clusters in Iceland, Colorado, Slovakia and Sardinia. He found that people and animals had been exposed to deficiencies of   copper and surfeits of manganese. Most of the clusters, intriguingly, are in mountainous areas, where levels of ultraviolet light are high. But the most compelling evidence in support of his hypothesis comes from a paper published by a team of biochemists at Cambridge this year. They found that when copper was substituted by manganese in prion proteins, the prions adopted precisely the distinguishing features which identify the infective agent in BSE.  If Purdey is right, he deserves a Nobel Prize for medicine. Instead he has been shot at, his phone lines have been cut and his house has been burnt down. The Ministry of Agriculture, which for 50 years has enjoyed a dangerously close relationship with the agrochemical industry, has repeatedly sought to discredit him. Suddenly, however, its tone has changed, and it has now promised to start funding his research. The families of the French victims of CJD are threatening to sue the British government, and it desperately needs an alternative transmission theory. With funding on its way, and new evidence accumulating every month, a self-educated Somerset dairy farmer could be about to overturn the entire body of scientific research on the biggest public health scandal of modern times.","Injudicious as Neil Hamilton's misdemeanors were, they were only the flotsam on the tide of Tory sleaze. Houses were boarded up to change voting patterns, false certificates were used to evade arms embargoes and palms were greased to help secure foreign contracts. Conservative corruption left such a broad tideline that it isn't easy to say where the highwater mark was. But many would choose a story which resulted in the most humiliating legal verdict any recent British government has faced: the Pergau dam scandal. The Tory administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Malaysia, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Aid and Trade Provision.  If, somehow, you managed to miss this drama, don't worry. The whole intriguing tale is now being repeated by a government near you. The Labour administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, has misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Turkey, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Export Credit Guarantee Department.  There is, however, one critical difference. The primary purpose of the Pergau dam, like that of most major construction, was to provide lucrative work for large companies. The Ilisu dam in Turkey will certainly fulfil this function. Like Pergau, it will also provide some electricity, though not, of course, as much as forecast. But the main purposes of the Turkish government's project are quite different. The first is to hold Syria and Iraq to ransom by controlling the flow of the river Tigris. The second is to assist its ethnic cleansing programme.  Hasankeyf, an ancient city, is one of the most important archaeological sites on earth; contin- uously inhabited for 10,000 years, it bears the remains of nine distinct civilisations. The Kurds regard the city as their cultural heartland. Turkey sees it as an emblem of resistance. When Hasankeyf and surrounding settlements are drowned by the dam, some 20,000 Kurds will be forced from their homes and moved into model villages in which they can be monitored and controlled. Our government, which went to war in the spring to stop ethnic cleansing, is, in the winter, underwriting it.  It is not hard to see why. European leaders have just agreed that Turkey can join the union: one result will be valuable contracts for British companies if the government   can forge strong commercial links with the Turkish administration. British companies see the country's defence sector as a massive potential market.  The Labour government's involvement in the Ilisu dam may be the biggest corruption scandal in western Europe, but you could be forgiven for having missed it. The decision was, it seems, to have been announced on Christmas Eve, but when the Hamilton verdict broke, the government seized its chance. The headline on the press release it distributed indicated only that Stephen Byers, the secretary of state for trade and industry, had released reports about the dam. Only halfway down the press release was notice given that Mr Byers was ""minded to grant"" the project government backing. A story which should have been at the top of the bulletins was either missed or excluded altogether. The Labour government, in other words, has successfully hidden its own corruption behind a tale of Tory sleaze.  The reports on which the   government's decision is supposed to have been based provide a compelling case for taking precisely the opposite course. They show that most local people object to the dam, that no provisions have been made for adequate compensation, that the project has been attended by an information black-out, that it threatens fish species found only in the Tigris, and could poison the water downstream. The ""consultation"" and ""informed consent"" the reports insist must take place before the project goes ahead are a sick joke in a region in which dissent is ruthlessly crushed and people are imprisoned and tortured simply for speaking their own language. As the Kurdish Human Rights Project has documented, 19 villages in the area due to be flooded have already been evicted at gunpoint and destroyed. Instead of insisting that human rights are respected and the environment is defended, the British government is relying on assurances from the Turkish authorities, which are about as dependable as Neil Hamilton's memory.  Silenced by Turkey's repression, the Kurds are a half- forgotten, disposable people. Our government has wrapped them up and handed them over to big business. Christmas presents seldom come so generous."

If Purdey is right, he deserves a Nobel Prize for medicine. Instead he has been shot at, his phone lines have been cut and his house has been burnt down. The Ministry of Agriculture, which for 50 years has enjoyed a dangerously close relationship with the agrochemical industry, has repeatedly sought to discredit him. Suddenly, however, its tone has changed, and it has now promised to start funding his research. The families of the French victims of CJD are threatening to sue the British government, and it desperately needs an alternative transmission theory. With funding on its way, and new evidence accumulating every month, a self-educated Somerset dairy farmer could be about to overturn the entire body of scientific research on the biggest public health scandal of modern times.","These are fearful times. The fall in the birth rate across the West is testimony to a growing pessimism about the future; the menaces that together seem to make the good life unattainable range from fear that science is running amok to terrorism and climate change. Live for today and don't have children is a rallying cry finding more adherents.The world is not a pleasant place and seems to be getting less pleasant fast. Above all else, we seem powerless to control and shape these forces; they exist as ominous influences that can no longer be contained.In this sense, the very idea of progress is now contested. No contemporary historians would trace British history, Macaulay-like, as an account of how democracy, the rule of law and the extension of British values have steadily increased their influence. We have no Sidney and Beatrice Webb dedicated to the possibility of social improvement. We have no Nye Bevan who can convince us that political action can shape the world.There is no Keynes to guide our economic thinking. There are no inventors or scientists so celebrated that when they die, London's streets would throng with mourners, as they did for Brunel and Stephenson in the nineteenth century.  Instead, there is a rise in credulity accompanied by an insistence that we must not meddle with natural verities. Religious fundamentalism, in the Christian and Islamic worlds alike, insists that religious texts should be interpreted literally. Christian creationists, arguing that God and not natural selection created the world, find a market as ready for their views as their counterparts in Islam.There is a small industry attacking the very idea of scientific method; for it, there is no objective material reality and the search to discover, explain and master the natural world has reached the ethical and moral limits. From now on, warn writers such as Francis Fukuyama, science is taking us into territory where it sets up men as gods able to manipulate the very marrow of humanity.This veneration of nature and suspicion of human agency makes conservatives of Right and Left alike. Political activism, even when allegedly radical, is imbued with a conservative streak. What is held out as the desirable norm is some Elysian state of nature in which there are no GM crops, only sustainable energy use, science is caged and communities are self-sustaining, trading as little as possible with the outside world. Prince Charles and the Greens make common purpose.This seeps into how we feel about social experimentation generally. New ways of teaching, of parenting, of living with other races are frowned on. We must stick to natural rules. David Goodhart, a liberal intellectual, wins an astonishing number of column inches arguing that as we prefer to associate with our own, there is a necessary and inevitable trade-off between solidarity and diversity.When the Left criticises Blair and New Labour for their lack of radicalism and their caution, it rarely places the criticism in this wider context. A progressive party can't flourish in an environment where the currents feeding progressivism are in retreat. The character of politics has a symbiotic relationship with the society of which it is part. If the cultural, intellectual and social forces that underpin progressive politics are themselves challenged, even the most inspired political leadership will only change matters at the margin. It's a fair complaint that New Labour attempts that only fitfully, but let's put the complaint into context.Blair and Brown are more conscious of this missing component of the progressive project than most commentators concede and Brown, particularly, thinks deeply about how to resurrect some confidence in the idea of progress. Which is why his breakfast meeting last week with 30 leaders of Britain's scientific community was of more importance than just to British science. Brown, and Blair for that matter, not only see British scientists as a core part of the New Labour progressive coalition, they see a revival of science and recovery of its self-belief as a handmaiden for advancing the economy and the idea of progress.Brown committed to a 10-year build up of investment in Britain's science infrastructure which will be the centrepiece of this summer's comprehensive spending review. He wants the share of GDP devoted to scientific research to rise towards the top of the international league table. He wants more collaboration between universities and business; more scientists and more science taught in schools, reversing the alarming decline in scientific GCSE and A-levels over the last 15 years.Moreover, the Government is prepared to take risks to make researchers feel that Britain is science-friendly; it countenances stem-cell research, wants to agree wider trials with GM food and will have no truck with the anti-vivisection movement. More investment is being accompanied by a cultural commitment to science; here, the Government shows a leadership that eludes it over Europe and the euro or the case for higher taxation.Which is all to the good, but I fear it underestimates the scale of the task. In the nineteenth century and for a good part of the twentieth, science was underpinned by a widespread understanding that it underwrote progress and prosperity alike. The shrinking of Britain's manufacturing base means that the number of sizable science-based companies hardly extends beyond aerospace and pharmaceuticals.  Today's prosperity is built on a credit-backed consumer boom and a service-sector economy that push forward independently of the state of science. In the US, some of the most dynamic parts of the country are the new 'ideopolises', where science-based universities spearhead the growth of new industries; apart from Cambridge, there are no British ideopolises, although Manchester has ambitions.But we need not just companies and parts of Britain which we can hold up as exemplars of the prosperity science can bring. We need a wider cultural acceptance that where science is currently taking us - understanding the building blocks on which life is constructed - is not terrifying but exhilarating.While scientific method does work to push back the frontiers of knowledge, it is also true that we need ever more robust mechanisms to discuss its implications and ensure that the benefits are universally shared and ethical risks universally guarded against.Science, paradoxically, has always flowered best when society has a strong public realm which allows it to have confidence that science ultimately can be made to serve us rather than be used against us - the fear of those who want to ban stem-cell research, cloning and GM foods.  Today's public realm is shrivelled and under siege; it, too, needs to be shored up. To revive the idea of progress is to revive the public realm that allows us to shape the world, rather than be shaped by it. New Labour is undertaking a proper fight, but it needs to think much bigger if it wants to win it."
1,"Injudicious as Neil Hamilton's misdemeanors were, they were only the flotsam on the tide of Tory sleaze. Houses were boarded up to change voting patterns, false certificates were used to evade arms embargoes and palms were greased to help secure foreign contracts. Conservative corruption left such a broad tideline that it isn't easy to say where the highwater mark was. But many would choose a story which resulted in the most humiliating legal verdict any recent British government has faced: the Pergau dam scandal. The Tory administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Malaysia, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Aid and Trade Provision.  If, somehow, you managed to miss this drama, don't worry. The whole intriguing tale is now being repeated by a government near you. The Labour administration, being determined to secure contracts for both its arms manufacturers and the construction company Balfour Beatty, has misdirected some £200m to finance a white elephant dam in Turkey, through an obscure funding mechanism called the Export Credit Guarantee Department.  There is, however, one critical difference. The primary purpose of the Pergau dam, like that of most major construction, was to provide lucrative work for large companies. The Ilisu dam in Turkey will certainly fulfil this function. Like Pergau, it will also provide some electricity, though not, of course, as much as forecast. But the main purposes of the Turkish government's project are quite different. The first is to hold Syria and Iraq to ransom by controlling the flow of the river Tigris. The second is to assist its ethnic cleansing programme.  Hasankeyf, an ancient city, is one of the most important archaeological sites on earth; contin- uously inhabited for 10,000 years, it bears the remains of nine distinct civilisations. The Kurds regard the city as their cultural heartland. Turkey sees it as an emblem of resistance. When Hasankeyf and surrounding settlements are drowned by the dam, some 20,000 Kurds will be forced from their homes and moved into model villages in which they can be monitored and controlled. Our government, which went to war in the spring to stop ethnic cleansing, is, in the winter, underwriting it.  It is not hard to see why. European leaders have just agreed that Turkey can join the union: one result will be valuable contracts for British companies if the government   can forge strong commercial links with the Turkish administration. British companies see the country's defence sector as a massive potential market.  The Labour government's involvement in the Ilisu dam may be the biggest corruption scandal in western Europe, but you could be forgiven for having missed it. The decision was, it seems, to have been announced on Christmas Eve, but when the Hamilton verdict broke, the government seized its chance. The headline on the press release it distributed indicated only that Stephen Byers, the secretary of state for trade and industry, had released reports about the dam. Only halfway down the press release was notice given that Mr Byers was ""minded to grant"" the project government backing. A story which should have been at the top of the bulletins was either missed or excluded altogether. The Labour government, in other words, has successfully hidden its own corruption behind a tale of Tory sleaze.  The reports on which the   government's decision is supposed to have been based provide a compelling case for taking precisely the opposite course. They show that most local people object to the dam, that no provisions have been made for adequate compensation, that the project has been attended by an information black-out, that it threatens fish species found only in the Tigris, and could poison the water downstream. The ""consultation"" and ""informed consent"" the reports insist must take place before the project goes ahead are a sick joke in a region in which dissent is ruthlessly crushed and people are imprisoned and tortured simply for speaking their own language. As the Kurdish Human Rights Project has documented, 19 villages in the area due to be flooded have already been evicted at gunpoint and destroyed. Instead of insisting that human rights are respected and the environment is defended, the British government is relying on assurances from the Turkish authorities, which are about as dependable as Neil Hamilton's memory.  Silenced by Turkey's repression, the Kurds are a half- forgotten, disposable people. Our government has wrapped them up and handed them over to big business. Christmas presents seldom come so generous.","The most interesting aspect of France's BSE scandal is that it makes no sense at all. Britain stopped exporting contaminated cattle feed to Europe in 1991 (though we continued sending it to the third world until 1996). In most other EU countries cases have already peaked and declined, as expected. But in France, the number of infected animals has doubled in the last year. It is impossible to see how this pattern could result from the export of British bone meal. The simple fact is that the transmission of BSE has never been satisfactorily explained by the prevailing theory. The consumption of meat and bone meal from infected cows has doubtless had an important role to play. Yet this explanation alone fails to account for the huge numbers of cattle in Britain which continued to become infected after most contaminated feed had been removed from the food chain. The latest research on the human form of the disease, nvCJD, published three weeks ago, failed to find any link with the consumption of infected beef.  You might have imagined that when its theory isn't working, a government would wish to test the alternatives. But the British administration has, so far, sought only to attack a hypothesis which does appear to fit the facts. Since 1988, a Somerset farmer called Mark Purdey has been arguing that scientists have overlooked the root causes of BSE. Self-taught and self- financed, he has mastered the brain's complex biochemical pathways and this year published a groundbreaking paper in a respected medical journal. His reward is to have been reviled, misrepresented and physically attacked.  Prions, the brain proteins whose alteration seems to be responsible for BSE, are designed to protect the brain from the oxidising properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultra- violet light, Purdey argues. When, he suggests, the prion proteins are exposed to too little copper and too much manganese, the manganese takes the place of the copper the prion normally binds to. This means that the protein becomes distorted and loses its function.   BSE arose in British herds during the 1980s, Mark Purdey asserts, because the Ministry of Agriculture started forcing all cattle farmers to treat their animals with an organophosphate pesticide called phosmet, at far higher doses than are used elsewhere in the world. The pesticide had to be poured along the line of the spinal cord. Phosmet, Purdey has shown, captures copper. At the same time, cattle feed was being supplemented with chicken manure, from birds dosed with manganese to increase their egg yield. The prion proteins in the cows' brains were   both deprived of copper and dosed with manganese. In France, the use of phosmet first became mandatory in Brittany. Twenty of the country's initial 28 cases of BSE emerged there. BSE's subsequent spread, Purdey maintains, mirrors the use of the pesticide.  Poisoning by similar means may explain the distribution of the human form of the disease. Of the two main clusters in Britain one, in Kent, is in the middle of a fruit and hop growing area where huge quantities of both organophosphates and manganese-based fungicides are used. The other is in Queniborough in Leicestershire, whose dyeworks (until they caught fire a few years ago, spraying chemicals over the village) used to dump some of their residues into the sewage system, Purdey alleges. The sewage was spread over the fields. Dyeworks use shedloads of manganese.  Purdey has tested his theory on BSE and CJD clusters in Iceland, Colorado, Slovakia and Sardinia. He found that people and animals had been exposed to deficiencies of   copper and surfeits of manganese. Most of the clusters, intriguingly, are in mountainous areas, where levels of ultraviolet light are high. But the most compelling evidence in support of his hypothesis comes from a paper published by a team of biochemists at Cambridge this year. They found that when copper was substituted by manganese in prion proteins, the prions adopted precisely the distinguishing features which identify the infective agent in BSE.  If Purdey is right, he deserves a Nobel Prize for medicine. Instead he has been shot at, his phone lines have been cut and his house has been burnt down. The Ministry of Agriculture, which for 50 years has enjoyed a dangerously close relationship with the agrochemical industry, has repeatedly sought to discredit him.

Christmas presents seldom come so generous.","Gordon Brown arrived on the front bench in the Commons, laughing and joking with Tony Blair. Laughing and joking? With Tony Blair? Things must be desperate. The prime minister was about to shaft him. And so he did. Shortly after that he told us to expect a referendum on membership of   the euro within - he implied - two years of the election. The chancellor himself would prefer it some time after a giant meteor has wiped out all life on earth. At least that way he'd know the result in advance.  Step back with me two hours in time, to 1pm yesterday. I was at the Channel 4 Political Awards, to be shown at 8pm on Saturday. It'll be a funny show, so catch it if you can, though it goes out at the same time as Casualty. You might find it hard to tell the difference. (""This man's career is hanging by a thread! We need oxygen, a blood transfusion, and a heart transplant!"" ""But doctor, look, the Mandelson case file says 'do not resuscitate!'"")   At my table was Lembit Opik, the LibDem MP who has spent the last few years telling us that the meteor could strike at any time. I asked if we wouldn't have a few weeks' warning, to send up a nuclear device up to smash the rock before it hits us. He said we might get two minutes. What a cheery companion he proved to be.  Jon Snow, the presenter, made a joke about Michael Meacher ""only stopping by to pick up the rent"". That got a big laugh.  Lembit Opik appeared on camera talking about Gordon Prentice, a keen opponent of fox-hunting. He, Lembit, had suggested to him that it should remain legal, but there should be a regulatory   agency called ""Off-fox"". Mr Prentice had replied ""using the same words, but in the reverse order"".  There were some queeny ""whoo, whoos"" from the assembled pols and hacks, but Gordon Brown looked much amused.  Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing, was briefly fooled on air by a phone call from Tony Blair - actually a member of Radio 4's Dead Ringers team. The prime minister would like to visit his constituency. ""I can promise you no tomatoes,"" said Mr Pound, ""but a few kiwi fruits and aubergines, perhaps...""  The next winner was the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley, for his book about New   Labour and their general contempt for the voters. It is said that Gordon Brown was a source for this work, but now regrets telling the author whatever it was he said.  As the oeuvre was being praised, the chancellor looked thunderous. Margaret Beckett, two seats away, smiled a tight little smile.  Mr Rawnsley praised his wife for all her help. ""She is my rock, my comfort and my joy,"" he said. The chancellor's jaw literally hung open. He hugged himself, like someone signalling the maitre d' to bring a strait jacket.  Then Mr Brown himself won the top award of all, for ""the MP who has been the most outstanding figure in the House"". They showed   short clips of people praising him. He looked delighted. Who wouldn't be? Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews declared on the monitors: ""He is an absolutely typical Lowland Scot. He believes in the virtues of toil, and plunder.""  Back in the Commons, Mr Blair was replying to William Hague. Did an early referendum on the euro mean within two years of the next parliament? (The Tory leader seems to have given up any hope of winning.)  ""Early in the next parliament would, of course, be within two years,"" Mr Blair replied. Mr Brown scowled.  Win some, lose some. But he seems to win nearly all the time, so I don't suppose he'll mind too much."
1,"b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday July 17 2005</b><br><br>The comment piece below was wrong to say that the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen was 'delighted' at the attack on the World Trade Centre, describing it as 'a great work of art'. In fact, Stockhausen made a statement to the effect that he believed the devil was still an active force in the world and condemned the attack as 'Lucifer's greatest work of art'. Apologies.<br><br><hr size=""1""><br>The instinctive response of a significant portion of the rich world's intelligentsia to the murder of innocents on 11 September was anything but robust. A few, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, were delighted. The destruction of the World Trade Centre was 'the greatest work of art imaginable for the whole cosmos,' declared the composer whose tin ear failed to catch the screams.Others saw it as a blow for justice rather than art. They persuaded themselves that al-Qaeda was made up of anti-imperialist insurgents who were avenging the wrongs of the poor. 'The great speculators wallow in an economy that every year kills tens of millions of people with poverty, so what is 20,000 dead in New York?' asked Dario Fo. Rosie Boycott seemed to agree. 'The West should take the blame for pushing people in Third World countries to the end of their tether,' she wrote.In these bleak days, it's worth remembering what was said after September 2001. A backward glance shows that before the war against the Taliban and long before the war against Saddam Hussein, there were many who had determined that 'we had it coming'. They had to convince themselves that Islamism was a Western creation: a comprehensible reaction to the International Monetary Fund or hanging chads in Florida or whatever else was agitating them, rather than an autonomous psychopathic force with reasons of its own. In the years since, this manic masochism has spread like bindweed and strangled leftish and much conservative thought.All kinds of hypocrisy remained unchallenged. In my world of liberal London, social success at the dinner table belonged to the man who could simultaneously maintain that we've got it coming but that nothing was going to come; that indiscriminate murder would be Tony Blair's fault but there wouldn't be indiscriminate murder because 'the threat' was a phantom menace invented by Blair to scare the cowed electorate into supporting him.I'd say the 'power of nightmares' side of that oxymoronic argument is too bloodied to be worth discussing this weekend and it's better to stick with the wider delusion.On Thursday, before the police had made one arrest, before one terrorist group had claimed responsibility, before one body had been carried from the wreckage, let alone been identified and allowed to rest in peace, cocksure voices filled with righteousness were proclaiming that the real murderers weren't the real murderers but the Prime Minister. I'm not thinking of George Galloway and the other saluters of Saddam, but of upright men and women who sat down to write letters to respectable newspapers within minutes of hearing the news.'Hang your head in shame, Mr Blair. Better still, resign - and whoever takes over immediately withdraw all our forces from Iraq and Afghanistan,' wrote the Rev Mike Ketley, who is a vicar, for God's sake, but has no qualms about leaving Afghanistan to the Taliban and al-Qaeda or Iraq to the Baath party and al-Qaeda. 'Let's stop this murder and put on trial those criminals who are within our jurisdiction,' began Patrick Daly of south London in an apparently promising letter to the Independent. But, inevitably, he didn't mean the bombers. 'Let's start with the British government.'And so it went on. At no point did they grasp that Islamism was a reactionary movement as great as fascism, which had claimed millions of mainly Muslim lives in the Sudan, Iran, Algeria and Afghanistan and is claiming thousands in Iraq. As with fascism, it takes a resolute dunderheadedness to put all the responsibility on democratic governments for its existence.I feel the appeal, believe me. You are exasperated with the manifold faults of Tony Blair and George W Bush. Fighting your government is what you know how to do and what you want to do, and when you are confronted with totalitarian forces which are far worse than your government, the easy solution is to blame your government for them.But it's a parochial line of reasoning to suppose that all bad, or all good, comes from the West - and a racist one to boot. The unavoidable consequence is that you must refuse to support democrats, liberals, feminists and socialists in the Arab world and Iran who are the victims of Islamism in its Sunni and Shia guises because you are too compromised to condemn their persecutors.Islamism stops being an ideology intent on building an empire from Andalusia to Indonesia, destroying democracy and subjugating women and becomes, by the magic of parochial reasoning, a protest movement on a par with Make Poverty History or the TUC.Again, I understand the appeal. Whether you are brown or white, Muslim, Christian, Jew or atheist, it is uncomfortable to face the fact that there is a messianic cult of death which, like European fascism and communism before it, will send you to your grave whatever you do. But I'm afraid that's what the record shows.The only plausible excuse for 11 September was that it was a protest against America's support for Israel. Unfortunately, Osama bin Laden's statements revealed that he was obsessed with the American troops defending Saudi Arabia from Saddam Hussein and had barely said a word about Palestine.After the Bali bombings, the conventional wisdom was that the Australians had been blown to pieces as a punishment for their government's support for Bush. No one thought for a moment about the Australian forces which stopped Indonesian militias rampaging through East Timor, a small country Indonesia had invaded in 1975 with the backing of the US. Yet when bin Laden spoke, he said it was Australia's anti-imperialist intervention to free a largely Catholic population from a largely Muslim occupying power which had bugged him.East Timor was a great cause of the left until the Australians made it an embarrassment. So, too, was the suffering of the victims of Saddam, until the tyrant made the mistake of invading Kuwait and becoming America's enemy. In the past two years in Iraq, UN and Red Cross workers have been massacred, trade unionists assassinated, school children and aid workers kidnapped and decapitated and countless people who happened to be on the wrong bus or on the wrong street at the wrong time paid for their mistake with their lives.What can the survivors do? Not a lot according to a Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He told bin Laden that the northern Kurds may be Sunni but 'Islam's voice has died out among them' and they'd been infiltrated by Jews. The southern Shia were 'a sect of treachery' while any Arab, Kurd, Shia or Sunni who believed in a democratic Iraq was a heretic.Our options are as limited When Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested for the Bali bombings, he was asked how the families of the dead could avoid the fate of their relatives. 'Please convert to Islam,' he replied. But as the past 40 years have shown, Islamism is mainly concerned with killing and oppressing Muslims.In his intervention before last year's American presidential election, bin Laden praised Robert Fisk of the Independent whose journalism he admired. 'I consider him to be neutral,' he said, so I suppose we could all resolve not to take the tube unless we can sit next to Mr Fisk. But as the killings are indiscriminate, I can't see how that would help and, in any case, who wants to be stuck on a train with an Independent reporter?There are many tasks in the coming days. Staying calm, helping the police and protecting Muslim communities from neo-Nazi attack are high among them. But the greatest is to resolve to see the world for what it is and remove the twin vices of wilful myopia and bad faith which have disfigured too much liberal thought for too long.","What should be done with Maff?"" cried Ian Willmore, media coordinator for Friends of the Earth. '""What should be done with Maff? Maff should be shot in the head, dumped in a trench, fried to a cinder, sprinkled with quicklime and buried with a stake through its heart, that's what should be done with Maff ...and you can quote me on that if you want.""In normal circumstances quotation would be all but pointless. Willmore would be a voice from the green fringe, which could be dismissed by those whose opinions matter with the killer condemnatory sentence: 'No one takes him seriously.' Not this time, I think. The foot and mouth epidemic has had the cheering effect of shifting the fringe to the mainstream.  I've never found New Labour politicians and advisers as furious or as willing to talk to Leftie hacks. Undoubtedly the anger has been caused in part by the postponement of elections. But it is elevated by a less partisan contempt for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a determination that it should share the fate of millions of beasts. 'We've learned the hard way that the department which gave us BSE is the last organisation you want on your side in a crisis,' said one.  The official line is that the fall in the daily count of new cases shows that the slaughter programme is 'beginning to bite'. No one wants to contradict guarded optimism in public. In private, however, many worry about spread rather than numbers. There may be fewer outbreaks but they are popping up all over the country - in Shropshire, Cornwall, and the Peak District. This does not look like an emergency which has been contained. Above all, the strength of the disease in Cumbria terrifies officials. ""I don't know if we can stop it sweeping across to the Humber, however many animals we slaughter,' said one member of the Downing Street crisis team. 'We may have to think about vaccination again.""Opposition to vaccination is the ruling passion of the National Farmers' Union and Maff (the NFU's political wing). If their dogma is overturned both will be humiliated and Maff may die of shame and be replaced by a Ministry for Rural Affairs. Sticking to slaughter until the last cow dies in the last ditch suits their interests, but administrative convenience may not be enough to save Maff when New Labour's confrontation with the Ministry has been so disillusioning.  The party came to power as modernisers. In agriculture, as in so much else, 'modernity' meant more of the   same. A party adviser described Maff as a dumping ground for civil servants. The wages were lower, the chances of moving on to a better job in Whitehall non-existent. A posting to Maff was the bureaucratic equivalent of a Politburo order to take up duties at a Mongolian power station or - to mix continents, and quite possibly metaphors as well - to check in for an indefinite stay at the Hotel California. ""It was a secretive, depressed place,' he said, 'very suspicious of change, very defensive. New Ministers and new permanent secretaries can't stop the treacle layer of senior civil servants trapping new ideas."" Jack Cunningham, the first Labour Agriculture Minister, at least tried to change the privileges granted to the NFU by the Tories. He also noticed that while his office was a 10 feet square coop without a desk, senior civil servants were housed in some splendour. Cunningham made a fuss and the stories about 'Junket Jack', which were to help finish his career, duly appeared. The Civil Service can be vicious when crossed. 'Expect articles about how Nick Brown failed to heed the sound advice of righteous officials to surface within days,' my new friend predicted.  Back-covering briefers will have to work hard. The suicidally honest Michael Meacher blurted out last week that there will be an inquiry when the mess is finally cleared up and was reprimanded for telling the truth. When it comes, as it will, the investigators must ask: why a Maff inspector missed the initial outbreak? Why animal movements were allowed for four days after foot and mouth was discovered? When did Maff officials warn Ministers that trouble was coming? Why were misleading figures on detection and slaughter rates fed to Downing Street? How rigorous was Maff in cracking down on the 'black sheep' smuggling market of subsidy-fiddling farmers? And why was the conclusion that the Army and epidemiologists should be called in at once, which had been reached by the inquiries into the 1967-68 outbreak, ignored?  The last question has provoked many accusations in the past few days. But exiles from Maff argue that it should be rephrased. 'Someone should look at all the contingency plans from '68 to the present day,' said one, 'and try to spot the differences. My hunch is that there won't be any.'  Maff has been stuck with a slaughter policy since the 1920s when it overrode the protests of small farmers, who saw no need for animals with a minor illness to be massacred, in the interests of big farmers, who wanted to eliminate a disease which reduced auction prices. My colleague Anthony Browne was referred to a study from the 1950s by the Maff   press office when he asked if slaughter was the best policy. It was as if all the modern advances in vaccination had never happened. Macedonia and Albania vaccinated successfully to stop the spread of the disease in 1996. But it has not been considered here for fear it would jeopardise a livestock export market worth a paltry £570 million.  Dissent has its risks. The Elm Farm Research Centre, a Berkshire agricultural charity, had to promise vets anonymity when it asked them to discuss the merits of vaccination. Public exposure would threaten their careers. The slaughtermen in the NFU, meanwhile, are presented as the sole representatives of farmers (just as the Countryside Alliance is presented as sole representative of the countryside) though only 53,000 of the 180,000 farmers in England and Wales are members.  Farmers' organisations who favour vaccination are shut out. Mike Hart of the Small and Family Farmers Alliance told me how he and other small farming groups had tried to get past Maff and into see Blair to argue against mass slaughter. They gave up after 'hitting the   proverbial brick wall'. What we are witnessing is the sanctification of a dubious slaughter policy with little concern for the public interest.  Stephen Tindale, who was Meacher's political adviser at the Department of the Environment until earlier this year, is not surprised. He remembered the Government receiving pathetic complaints from farm workers afflicted with depression, lassitude and chronic muscular pains - the effects, they maintained of organo-phosphate sheep dips. Maff officials dismissed their claims. No one knew if the sheep dip was the culprit, they said, but the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh was on the case. The Institute duly reported that a link between exposure to sheep dip and 'chronic peripheral neuropathy' [damage to the nervous system] was 'suggested' by its research. Whitehall's Committee on Toxicity preferred to bin the report and uphold the reputation of the agri-chemical industry.  They may have been right to do so, I'm not qualified to judge. I do know that a majority of supposedly sovereign consumers do not want GM foods, but public opinion did not stop Maff and Lord Sainsbury bowing to the wishes of the GM conglomerates regardless. Witnesses at Maff meetings described the insouciance of officials as they discussed the slow elimination of organic farming by GM crop contamination.  As with sheep dips and organic food, so with foot and mouth. Many have criticised postponing elections and wrecking the tourist industry for the sake of livestock exports, and counted the price in pounds and votes. Fewer have looked at what I can only call the spiritual consequences. For hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, rambling is an escape from regimentation. They have lost the right to roam. They are being told that the slaughter of Herdwick sheep will transform the open fells of the Lake District into a scrubland no one who has loved Wordsworth or followed a Wainwright guide will recognise - and that the Peak District could follow.  The absence of a public outcry about restrictions on freedom of movement is a sign of deference which is on a par with the ability of Virgin Train directors to appear in public without bodyguards. A more assertive citizenry would wonder why it is that Albania and Macedonia can vaccinate their way out of foot and mouth when we can't.  <B>Email update</B><BR><BR><BR><B>More on the election and foot and mouth</B><BR><B>What's going on?</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR><BR><BR><B>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</B><BR>  <BR>  <BR><BR>"
0,"b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday July 17 2005</b><br><br>The comment piece below was wrong to say that the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen was 'delighted' at the attack on the World Trade Centre, describing it as 'a great work of art'. In fact, Stockhausen made a statement to the effect that he believed the devil was still an active force in the world and condemned the attack as 'Lucifer's greatest work of art'. Apologies.<br><br><hr size=""1""><br>The instinctive response of a significant portion of the rich world's intelligentsia to the murder of innocents on 11 September was anything but robust. A few, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, were delighted. The destruction of the World Trade Centre was 'the greatest work of art imaginable for the whole cosmos,' declared the composer whose tin ear failed to catch the screams.Others saw it as a blow for justice rather than art. They persuaded themselves that al-Qaeda was made up of anti-imperialist insurgents who were avenging the wrongs of the poor. 'The great speculators wallow in an economy that every year kills tens of millions of people with poverty, so what is 20,000 dead in New York?' asked Dario Fo. Rosie Boycott seemed to agree. 'The West should take the blame for pushing people in Third World countries to the end of their tether,' she wrote.In these bleak days, it's worth remembering what was said after September 2001. A backward glance shows that before the war against the Taliban and long before the war against Saddam Hussein, there were many who had determined that 'we had it coming'. They had to convince themselves that Islamism was a Western creation: a comprehensible reaction to the International Monetary Fund or hanging chads in Florida or whatever else was agitating them, rather than an autonomous psychopathic force with reasons of its own. In the years since, this manic masochism has spread like bindweed and strangled leftish and much conservative thought.All kinds of hypocrisy remained unchallenged. In my world of liberal London, social success at the dinner table belonged to the man who could simultaneously maintain that we've got it coming but that nothing was going to come; that indiscriminate murder would be Tony Blair's fault but there wouldn't be indiscriminate murder because 'the threat' was a phantom menace invented by Blair to scare the cowed electorate into supporting him.I'd say the 'power of nightmares' side of that oxymoronic argument is too bloodied to be worth discussing this weekend and it's better to stick with the wider delusion.On Thursday, before the police had made one arrest, before one terrorist group had claimed responsibility, before one body had been carried from the wreckage, let alone been identified and allowed to rest in peace, cocksure voices filled with righteousness were proclaiming that the real murderers weren't the real murderers but the Prime Minister. I'm not thinking of George Galloway and the other saluters of Saddam, but of upright men and women who sat down to write letters to respectable newspapers within minutes of hearing the news.'Hang your head in shame, Mr Blair. Better still, resign - and whoever takes over immediately withdraw all our forces from Iraq and Afghanistan,' wrote the Rev Mike Ketley, who is a vicar, for God's sake, but has no qualms about leaving Afghanistan to the Taliban and al-Qaeda or Iraq to the Baath party and al-Qaeda. 'Let's stop this murder and put on trial those criminals who are within our jurisdiction,' began Patrick Daly of south London in an apparently promising letter to the Independent. But, inevitably, he didn't mean the bombers. 'Let's start with the British government.'And so it went on. At no point did they grasp that Islamism was a reactionary movement as great as fascism, which had claimed millions of mainly Muslim lives in the Sudan, Iran, Algeria and Afghanistan and is claiming thousands in Iraq. As with fascism, it takes a resolute dunderheadedness to put all the responsibility on democratic governments for its existence.I feel the appeal, believe me. You are exasperated with the manifold faults of Tony Blair and George W Bush. Fighting your government is what you know how to do and what you want to do, and when you are confronted with totalitarian forces which are far worse than your government, the easy solution is to blame your government for them.But it's a parochial line of reasoning to suppose that all bad, or all good, comes from the West - and a racist one to boot. The unavoidable consequence is that you must refuse to support democrats, liberals, feminists and socialists in the Arab world and Iran who are the victims of Islamism in its Sunni and Shia guises because you are too compromised to condemn their persecutors.Islamism stops being an ideology intent on building an empire from Andalusia to Indonesia, destroying democracy and subjugating women and becomes, by the magic of parochial reasoning, a protest movement on a par with Make Poverty History or the TUC.Again, I understand the appeal. Whether you are brown or white, Muslim, Christian, Jew or atheist, it is uncomfortable to face the fact that there is a messianic cult of death which, like European fascism and communism before it, will send you to your grave whatever you do. But I'm afraid that's what the record shows.The only plausible excuse for 11 September was that it was a protest against America's support for Israel. Unfortunately, Osama bin Laden's statements revealed that he was obsessed with the American troops defending Saudi Arabia from Saddam Hussein and had barely said a word about Palestine.After the Bali bombings, the conventional wisdom was that the Australians had been blown to pieces as a punishment for their government's support for Bush. No one thought for a moment about the Australian forces which stopped Indonesian militias rampaging through East Timor, a small country Indonesia had invaded in 1975 with the backing of the US. Yet when bin Laden spoke, he said it was Australia's anti-imperialist intervention to free a largely Catholic population from a largely Muslim occupying power which had bugged him.East Timor was a great cause of the left until the Australians made it an embarrassment. So, too, was the suffering of the victims of Saddam, until the tyrant made the mistake of invading Kuwait and becoming America's enemy. In the past two years in Iraq, UN and Red Cross workers have been massacred, trade unionists assassinated, school children and aid workers kidnapped and decapitated and countless people who happened to be on the wrong bus or on the wrong street at the wrong time paid for their mistake with their lives.What can the survivors do? Not a lot according to a Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He told bin Laden that the northern Kurds may be Sunni but 'Islam's voice has died out among them' and they'd been infiltrated by Jews. The southern Shia were 'a sect of treachery' while any Arab, Kurd, Shia or Sunni who believed in a democratic Iraq was a heretic.Our options are as limited When Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested for the Bali bombings, he was asked how the families of the dead could avoid the fate of their relatives. 'Please convert to Islam,' he replied. But as the past 40 years have shown, Islamism is mainly concerned with killing and oppressing Muslims.In his intervention before last year's American presidential election, bin Laden praised Robert Fisk of the Independent whose journalism he admired. 'I consider him to be neutral,' he said, so I suppose we could all resolve not to take the tube unless we can sit next to Mr Fisk. But as the killings are indiscriminate, I can't see how that would help and, in any case, who wants to be stuck on a train with an Independent reporter?There are many tasks in the coming days. Staying calm, helping the police and protecting Muslim communities from neo-Nazi attack are high among them. But the greatest is to resolve to see the world for what it is and remove the twin vices of wilful myopia and bad faith which have disfigured too much liberal thought for too long.","The Daily Star's initial verdict on Charles and Camilla was too downbeat. 'Boring Old Gits to Wed' does not do justice to a legal maelstrom featuring a register office boycott by the Queen, who has allegedly also shelved plans for a banquet. Instead, the sporran polishers of the royal household will be rustling up bite-sized pork pies and warm Lambrusco. Some monarchists blame this 'shambles' on Tony Blair. In their view, his poor advice on wedding protocol betokens a contempt for royalty almost tantamount to back-door abolition. The Queen might certainly have expected a Prime Minister entitled to declare wars in her name to check, in return, whether a licence for Windsor Castle would entitle any old Kev and Bev to plight their troth beneath the Holbeins en route to Legoland.  Otherwise, the executive cannot be accused of negligence. Far from it. On whether the wedding will be lawful, the government has shown the same attention to detail that it applied to the war on Iraq. Both verdicts followed the celebrity chef school of jurisprudence, under which a brace of versions that someone prepared earlier is reheated with new finishing touches.  On the war, two old UN security council resolutions - 678 and 687- were conflated with a new one - 1,441 - to make the legal case. For the wedding, the Marriage Acts of 1836 and 1949, both appearing to preclude royal civil weddings, were laced with the Human Rights Act 1998, which affirms that adults may marry as they wish.  The difference is that Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, has publicly given his view that the marriage would be legal after others, including a former Tory   attorney general, said it might not. By contrast, the government still refuses to publish the current attorney's full advice on Iraq, despite mounting pressure.  But the point, beyond that discrepancy, is not whether the attack was legal (which it was not) or whether the marriage is lawful (a more mixed verdict). The issue is that the legal status of a bloody war has, over the past week, had less media coverage than the legitimacy of a marriage between middle-aged co-habitees.  This imbalance does not support the idea of an irrelevant or dying monarchy. Some royalists think Charles can never now be king; republicans say a clan so reviled by its fans must be tumbrel-fodder. But the Windsors are admirably performing one function of heads of state: that of defining who we are.  It is not a good picture, of Britain or of a family that makes  Shameless  look patrician. Charles's household, bedevilled by royal butler trials, employment tribunals and rape allegations, is presided over by a future king allegedly accused by his ex-wife of wanting to bump her off.  But the bystanders don't sound too pleasant, either. Father Paul Williamson of Feltham, Middlesex, who thinks it 'heresy and apostasy' to ordain women priests, intends to be at the ceremony and object out loud if his formal bids to halt proceedings are ignored. Other hecklers may turn up, egged on by frothing constitutionalists and commentators enjoying some down-and-dirty royal baiting. The Queen, in a reasonable decision, won't be there.  That is not to justify her handling of this mess. A monarch happy to sign a football and visit a drive-thru McDonald's should have welcomed the mix-up under which licensing Windsor Castle would have opened it to other people's weddings. Why not? The Windsors, who fleece visitors for inspecting treasures that belong to the nation, should not suddenly behave as if the paying public are scummy peasants likely to carve their initials in the perpendicular Gothic   or stick their gum on the van Dycks. In opting instead for a register office open to any befrocked pseudo-terrorist who wants to kiss Prince William, the royals might as well have issued gilt-edged invitations exactly to hoi polloi they wanted to exclude. They have also, inadvertently, created the sort of royal family Britain purports to want.  A bickering chavocracy that marries in register offices should suit advocates of a bicycling monarchy. But suddenly, a finger buffet, with all that subtext of pastel Crimplene and gift-wrapped toasters, strikes the media as too naff for words. Why no glass coaches and spit-roast Highgrove stag? Where is the self-respect of a country that may not be able to run a food standards agency but which defers to no one on choreographing a fairytale royal wedding? At the heart of the Windsors' survival is a snobbery that permeates society.  The current fuss has also conferred on them a new and powerful role. The real function of this monarchy is to be the lightning conductor for national loathing. Britain, in common with much of Europe, combusts too much hatred seeking a permissible outlet. In an age of fear, citizens are formally encouraged by government to accept people who represent otherness, such as immigrants and asylum seekers.  But those messages come laced with insidious hints of warning. From the terrorist suspect who cannot be charged to the exploited foreign worker and the disturbed child hauled before the courts, the country   is full of targets for a poisonous, if furtive, dislike. So how cathartic to have the royals, a conduit for collective cruelty and the only legitimate locus for upfront detestation. Obviously, this bloodsport is media-driven. Many Britons have no view on Charles's petulance or Camilla's cellulite and wish the royal story would go away, or at least switch from the personal to the institutional.  For the Windsors' sake, and ours, the government should act fast. As Lord Lester and others recommend, it should pass a brief bill formally sanctioning the legality of the marriage and so heading off inevitable challenges. Then Tony Blair should point out to Charles that the wedding got its initial figleaf of legality only because of a human rights act the prince once denounced as 'a threat to sane, civilised and ordered existence'. That legislation rules that royals must be treated like any ordinary citizen. In recognition, the prince should, like any ordinary citizen, pay his taxes, live within his means and be banned from sponging shamelessly off the state.  Short term, this democracy is stuck with the Windsors. The hereditary principle may be indefensible but, even at the current low point, only 23 per cent of respondents to a YouGov poll want the monarchy to die with the Queen. Until there is enough public enthusiasm for an elected head of state, reform and some kindness are better than a baying mob, in which sneering republicans stand shoulder to shoulder with hardcore evangelicals and Diana loyalists who think Camilla a Medusa in hunting pink.  Spite risks damaging Britain far more than our venal royals, who are never much dented by periodic fits of dislike. On the contrary, unpopularity may work to the advantage of an institution still capable of inspiring national unity, albeit of the ugliest kind. When, eventually, the monarchy perishes, its death certificate will cite as cause not public rage but the indifference of a grown-up country."
1,"At the height of the fuel crisis, Margaret Beckett denounced that part of conservative Britain which tolerated elections only when they brought victories to the Right. 'There is a group of people in this country who passionately believe... that there is something terribly, terribly wrong about having a Labour government,' she said. 'Labour ought never to be in power and if we are we ought to fail.' She was ridiculed as a barking conspiracy theorist by those who forgot the plots of MI5, retired colonels and Napoleonic tycoons against the Wilson administrations, but not by those who have been keeping an eye on the Countryside Alliance. The Alliance's fight to save hunting is no longer being waged with vaguely rational arguments. Enter its collective mind and you are in a war of national liberation against an alien and depraved dictatorship. If you think I'm exaggerating, ask how Sam Butler, the Alliance's chairman, could bellow without a blush to a demonstration outside the Labour Party Conference: 'Our forefathers didn't fight Hitler to have this lot take away our liberties.' One of Butler's forefathers was 'Rab' Butler. He didn't fight Hitler, he appeased him throughout the Thirties and then aided Lord Halifax's manoeuvres to force Churchill to come to terms with the Nazi in 1940. His grandson cannot spot the difference between a Government which is reluctantly allowing a free vote on hunting in response to overwhelming public and backbench pressure, and a totalitarian invader.  Because Parliament will sooner or later ban hunting with dogs, the MPs who support the new Hitler must be presented as human filth; unnatural and unEnglish politicians who have forfeited the right to legislate.  The magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog, for example, which carries the Countryside Alliance's logo, said of Ben Bradshaw, the gay Labour MP for Exeter: 'Fortunately most people are still totally revolted by such lifestyles. Let us not forget the money the health service is forced to spend on the treatment of Aids - the gay plague.<I>Do we really deserve to have such people rule us and tell us what to do ?'</I> Bradshaw's black colleague, Oona King, meanwhile was 'typical of her species'. She was told to 'direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts [the editorialist means the London poor King represents, not farmers]. <I>She has no right to interfere in my life or anybody else's, apart from the deadbeats who helped send her to Parliament.'</I> Butler has told his troops that the Government's record was one of 'terrorists released, rioters allowed to roam the streets wreaking havoc and destruction, whilst the authorities look on'. The Alliance 'has made it clear to Parliament and public alike that we have been resolute in our determination to conduct our protests within the law.<I> However, should Parliament act perversely on the issue of personal freedom, then it will only have itself to blame for what may follow.'</I> (My italics throughout).  As you can see, the anti-hunting campaign isn't only about hunting. The Alliance is a porte-manteau stuffed with every rage against women, gays, blacks, the poor, the Good Friday Agreement ... a damnable modern world turned upside down.  Butler's prediction that hunters will take the law into their own hands if the deviants in Parliament 'act perversely' is already being realised. The provisional wing of the Countryside Alliance is the Rural Action Group. It affects an air of conspiratorial secrecy, while neglecting to take elementary precautions to protect its emails. The most recent warns of the need to 'keep quiet' about its plans for tractor and Land Rover owners to blockade Parliament Square (on 23 October, traffic wardens should note).  If this sounds like an imitation of the tactics of the flying fuel pickets, then the resemblance may be more than coincidental. You do not have to go all the way with Beckett's notion that the oil refinery protests were a plot to be struck by the overlap between the demonstrators, the Countryside Alliance and the Conservative Party. Protesters' cars at the Stanlow oil refinery bore Alliance stickers. Where Tony Blair was confronted with demonstrators in Hull they carried banners crying 'No Hunting, No Petrol'. Liberal commentators responded by dissecting the hypocrisy of supportive Conservative politicians and newspapers who usually demand punitive sanctions against greedy strikers 'holding the country ransom'. But in truth their double-standard charge cut both ways. If Lefties believe urban workers are entitled to take action to protect their livelihoods, how can they criticise farmers suffering in the wors  agricultural depression since the Thirties for following suit?  Honest critics would be forced to hold their tongues if the Alliance and its fellow travellers represented the countryside. Predictably, they do nothing of the sort. Sam Butler isn't a persecuted yeoman, but a millionaire estate agent who has made his fortune by selling Cotswold property to the commuters and second-home owners who price the local peasantry out of the market. Britain's biggest builders - Robert McAlpine, Sunley Holdings, Persimmon Homes - are among his backers. So too is the Duke of Devonshire who wants to bring open-cast mining to his Derbyshire estate. These are 'countrymen' who are 'for field sports, not fields', as the International Fund for Animal Welfare neatly put it.  They are also the Tory party on horseback. The Alliance offices are filled with ex-Conservative officials and MPs who lost their jobs in the 1997 massacre. Conservative councillors joined the refinery picket lines. My guess is that the Government's attempts to strike a deal with fuel blockaders before their deadline runs out in 28 days will be futile. Their Tory wing may find it hard to see the political mileage in compromise.  The losers from the hijacking of rural grievance by the estate agents and developers are poor farmers. The best hope for an agricultural industry being crucified by a high pound is early entry to the European monetary union. The Alliance will no more support scrapping the pound than gay marriage or a windfall tax on the oil cartel.  Hunters themselves have respectable arguments against the faux humanitarianism of prohibiting hunting with dogs but not with guns. They might ask that if the language of socialism is the language of priorities, what seriously radical Labour Party would waste a moment on fox hunting after 18 years in opposition? They could, and indeed have, concluded that their opponents are more concerned with persecuting hunters than saving foxes.  For all that, the reasons to tolerate hunting have been destroyed by the hunting lobby. Any civilised person who has gaped at its bigotry can only shrug and mutter: all persecution is fine by me.    <B>And the biggest criminal is ... the governor, apparently</B>As our politicians are meant to be eager to save us from crime, you might have thought that a prison governor who managed to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens would be f&ecirc;ted.  Yet Eoin McLellan-Murray, the governor of Blantyre House, was loathed. He ran a prison with the lowest number of positive drug tests of any jail in Britain. It didn't help him.  Just 8 per cent of his inmates reoffended on release. The achievement served only to goad his enemies. In April they organised a raid by 80 officers dressed as if they were a Swat team breaking up a terrorist cell. McLellan-Murray was suspended and his jail was ransacked.  His offence was to run a liberal prison which prepared inmates for release by letting them work for Kent employers and charities.  Given the jail's success, reasons had to be found for destroying its regime. Martin Narey, the Director General of the Prison Service, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee in May that he had confidential intelligence of villainy in the jail which he couldn't discuss for fear of prejudicing criminal investigations. Kent Police said there were no criminal investigations.  His officers had uncovered stolen goods and escape equipment as they tore through the cells, Narey continued. He did not tell MPs that 'stolen' bank cards were the legally held property of working prisoners and the escape equipment was the tools of a prisoner who was repairing a Mencap charity shop.  This week the Home Affairs Committee will call Narey back to explain himself. Understandably, he has asked to give his evidence in secret. I hope the MPs will turn him down and ask why they were spun dark tales of criminal conspiracy and contraband which cannot be substantiated.  They should also inquire about the fate of the governor. Since the biggest raid in the recent history of the Prison Service failed to find anything McLellan-Murray need be ashamed of, he has been subjected to months of interrogation by Home Office hardliners desperate to find a justification for zero tolerance reduced to absurdity.  Last week, they gave us their best shot. Harry Fletcher, the spokesman for the probation officers union, reports McLellan-Murray will face disciplinary charges of failing to account for the purchase of a gas cylinder worth £110, two electric sockets priced at £8.56 and a £500 donation to the mentally ill from the prison's charitable funds.  He is not being accused of pocketing the money. It is merely that he or one of his subordinates didn't fill out the right forms when they dealt with the paperwork. For these terrible sins, one of the finest public servants in the Home Office will see his career wrecked while Narey's flourishes. 'Scandal' is an overused word by hacks, but in this instance no other will do.","As with so much else in Britain, whether or not you believe evil exists depends on your class. Readers of the popular papers have few difficulties accepting that terrible crimes from the murder of James Bulger to the serial killings of Harold Shipman can be explained by evil. But even bishops who read the broadsheets - or the 'unpopular papers' as Kelvin MacKenzie, a former editor of the Sun, once unkindly suggested we should be called - become fidgety in evil's presence. George W. Bush lost what slender chance he had of winning over middle-class liberal opinion when he denounced the 'Axis of Evil'. Politicians who use the word are seeking to 'demonise' enemies by turning them into monsters, argue those who don't think that the leaders of North Korea and Iraq were capable of becoming monstrous without help from others. Tabloid editors are as calculating. They need a constant supply of monsters to keep the paying public in a profitable state of outraged terror.  There's a lot to be said for conventional liberal wisdom. It has been almost comic to watch the effort put into turning Maxine Carr into the next Myra Hindley. She seemed perfect for the part: good-looking in certain lights; dead-eyed; and, apparently, motivated by an unnatural desire to assist her cruel lover in whatever he wanted to do. The shameful spectacle of the Home Secretary rushing to rig the law to prevent Carr's early release from prison last week was the fruit of a lot of hard work by my colleagues. In the end, however, Carr will fail the horror-movie screen test. She didn't help Ian Huntley. She was one of his victims in her own small way: a regular recipient of his beatings. Prison officers, who don't tend to be among nature's bleeding hearts, describe her as a simpleton who is 'as daft as a brush' rather than a sinister manipulator. The Carr case seems to justify fastidious prejudices about the mob and the mob's newspapers. All the unwarranted attention she has received has done is ensure that she will need years of police protection from an ignorant public which has been maddened by a reckless media.  But the public isn't always as ignorant as the hounding of Carr implies. If its concept of evil didn't exist, it would have to be invented to cover the gap in all great crimes between understandable causes and inexplicable consequences.  Take the Bulger murder which dominated the crime debate in the 1990s and helped make Tony Blair Labour leader. All kinds of reasons were advanced to explain why Jon Venables and Robert Thompson slaughtered a toddler. They came from poor homes, their fathers had walked out on them, they had watched Child's Play II, and may have been inspired by the gruesome film. But honest journalists and detectives admitted at the end of the trial that none of the theories they advanced began to explain the cruelty of the killing. From what I hear from people who have talked to the social workers who looked after them in custody, Thompson and Venables can't explain why they did what they did either. There is a gap between cause and effect, and if you don't use the concept of evil to bridge it, you'll have to find another word with the same meaning.  The gap in the case of Thompson and Venables becomes a yawning chasm in the case of Harold Shipman. Because he never confessed, no one can adequately explain how the doctor became a mass murderer. The best journalists can do is say that he was driven to succeed by an ambitious mother who cosseted and petted him. Vera Shipman died suddenly when he was 17, and the shock of her death is meant to have pushed him into depression, drug-taking and, finally, murder. It's a rational theory but its proponents accept that it doesn't begin to account for Shipman's actions.  The families of the patients he killed didn't on the whole share the crass jubilation of David Blunkett and the Sun at news of his suicide. They felt that he had remained in control to the end, and dictated the terms of his own death as he had dictated the terms of the deaths of so many others. Many complained that they had been denied the chance of discovering why their relatives had been murdered. It's no disrespect to them to suggest that if Shipman had come clean, they probably wouldn't have heard an explanation which made sense.  The German-American intellectual Hannah Arendt gave the best reason why not when she invented the phrase 'the banality of evil'. (Her use of the word 'evil', by the way, can be excused by the fact that she was writing in 1961, an unsophisticated time when we hadn't learned that it was sinful to be judgmental.) The occasion for her outburst was the trial of Otto Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. He had organised the deportation of millions to Nazi death camps.  Arendt looked at him and was shocked to discover that 'the man in the glass booth was not even sinister ... The deeds were monstrous, but the doer was quite ordinary, commonplace, and neither demonic nor monstrous.' The worst she could say about him was that he had 'a curious, quite authentic inability to think ... When confronted with situations for which routine procedures did not exist, he was helpless, and his clich-ridden language produced on the stand, as it had evidently done in his official life, a kind of macabre comedy.'   Eichmann was just a good bureaucrat who obeyed orders. When he was in power, he committed unimaginable crimes; when he was on trial he was a shrivelled and ridiculous figure who didn't have the language to explain what he had done to himself, let alone to others.  Evil is banal. Time and again with mass murderers, people expect to see a demon who can inspire awe as well as fear, only to find that they are dealing with a babbling fool. I remember the stir among the journalists in Dunblane when the police announced that they would release copies of letters Thomas Hamilton had posted just before he walked into Dunblane Primary School and massacred 16 children and their teacher. We were sure that they would give us an explanation; a reason which would make sense of the senseless.  The letters turned out to be complaints against the Scouts, who had expelled him 20 years before for minor mistakes during a camping trip to the Highlands. There had been no public disgrace, nothing that could provoke murderous resentment in an ordinary man. Local organisers had simply decided that Hamilton wasn't up to being a Scout leader because boys under his care had gone back to their parents cold and wet after he had made them dig snow holes. Hamilton must have thought that when people read the letters they would understand why he had to commit an atrocity and then kill himself; that comprehension would lead to a posthumous pardon. The effect was the precise opposite: readers were mystified and contemptuous. All that for this?  Huntley, Shipman and Hamilton were petty offenders compared to the great criminals of our times. But the pattern remains the same. The shock which followed the arrest of Saddam Hussein was the shock of being confronted with banality. Here was a leader who had sent armies roaming across the Middle East, who had produced the death of a million in foreign wars and hundreds of thousands in domestic oppression, who had enforced a cult of the personality it was fatal to dissent from, who had forced four million people into exile, who had been indulged by the West, the Soviet Union and the Arab world and who was, at the end of a lifetime of terror, just a dirty old man cowering in a hole.  Like the families of Shipman's victims, Saddam's subjects will want an explanation. They're unlikely to get one from their former tormentor. Adel Abdul-Mehdi, a Shia politician, confronted the tyrant after his capture. What about the 300,000 corpses found in mass graves since the end of the war, he asked?  Like Hamilton, Saddam assumed that even the relatives of the dead would have to concede that there were good grounds for the executions. 'Ask their families,' he replied. 'They were thieves and they ran away from the battlefields with Iran and the battlefields of Kuwait.'  Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress, watched the exchange and noted that Saddam was 'not remorseful at all. It was clear he was a complete narcissist who was incapable of showing remorse or sympathy to other human beings.'  And that, I think, is about as near as you can get to defining evil. It is pure selfishness and pure thoughtlessness. Once a Shipman or a Saddam has been overthrown, the only point worth dwelling on is how on earth the rest of us let them get away with murder for so long."
0,"At the height of the fuel crisis, Margaret Beckett denounced that part of conservative Britain which tolerated elections only when they brought victories to the Right. 'There is a group of people in this country who passionately believe... that there is something terribly, terribly wrong about having a Labour government,' she said. 'Labour ought never to be in power and if we are we ought to fail.' She was ridiculed as a barking conspiracy theorist by those who forgot the plots of MI5, retired colonels and Napoleonic tycoons against the Wilson administrations, but not by those who have been keeping an eye on the Countryside Alliance. The Alliance's fight to save hunting is no longer being waged with vaguely rational arguments. Enter its collective mind and you are in a war of national liberation against an alien and depraved dictatorship. If you think I'm exaggerating, ask how Sam Butler, the Alliance's chairman, could bellow without a blush to a demonstration outside the Labour Party Conference: 'Our forefathers didn't fight Hitler to have this lot take away our liberties.' One of Butler's forefathers was 'Rab' Butler. He didn't fight Hitler, he appeased him throughout the Thirties and then aided Lord Halifax's manoeuvres to force Churchill to come to terms with the Nazi in 1940. His grandson cannot spot the difference between a Government which is reluctantly allowing a free vote on hunting in response to overwhelming public and backbench pressure, and a totalitarian invader.  Because Parliament will sooner or later ban hunting with dogs, the MPs who support the new Hitler must be presented as human filth; unnatural and unEnglish politicians who have forfeited the right to legislate.  The magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog, for example, which carries the Countryside Alliance's logo, said of Ben Bradshaw, the gay Labour MP for Exeter: 'Fortunately most people are still totally revolted by such lifestyles. Let us not forget the money the health service is forced to spend on the treatment of Aids - the gay plague.<I>Do we really deserve to have such people rule us and tell us what to do ?'</I> Bradshaw's black colleague, Oona King, meanwhile was 'typical of her species'. She was told to 'direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts [the editorialist means the London poor King represents, not farmers]. <I>She has no right to interfere in my life or anybody else's, apart from the deadbeats who helped send her to Parliament.'</I> Butler has told his troops that the Government's record was one of 'terrorists released, rioters allowed to roam the streets wreaking havoc and destruction, whilst the authorities look on'. The Alliance 'has made it clear to Parliament and public alike that we have been resolute in our determination to conduct our protests within the law.<I> However, should Parliament act perversely on the issue of personal freedom, then it will only have itself to blame for what may follow.'</I> (My italics throughout).  As you can see, the anti-hunting campaign isn't only about hunting. The Alliance is a porte-manteau stuffed with every rage against women, gays, blacks, the poor, the Good Friday Agreement ... a damnable modern world turned upside down.  Butler's prediction that hunters will take the law into their own hands if the deviants in Parliament 'act perversely' is already being realised. The provisional wing of the Countryside Alliance is the Rural Action Group. It affects an air of conspiratorial secrecy, while neglecting to take elementary precautions to protect its emails. The most recent warns of the need to 'keep quiet' about its plans for tractor and Land Rover owners to blockade Parliament Square (on 23 October, traffic wardens should note).  If this sounds like an imitation of the tactics of the flying fuel pickets, then the resemblance may be more than coincidental. You do not have to go all the way with Beckett's notion that the oil refinery protests were a plot to be struck by the overlap between the demonstrators, the Countryside Alliance and the Conservative Party. Protesters' cars at the Stanlow oil refinery bore Alliance stickers. Where Tony Blair was confronted with demonstrators in Hull they carried banners crying 'No Hunting, No Petrol'. Liberal commentators responded by dissecting the hypocrisy of supportive Conservative politicians and newspapers who usually demand punitive sanctions against greedy strikers 'holding the country ransom'. But in truth their double-standard charge cut both ways. If Lefties believe urban workers are entitled to take action to protect their livelihoods, how can they criticise farmers suffering in the wors  agricultural depression since the Thirties for following suit?  Honest critics would be forced to hold their tongues if the Alliance and its fellow travellers represented the countryside. Predictably, they do nothing of the sort. Sam Butler isn't a persecuted yeoman, but a millionaire estate agent who has made his fortune by selling Cotswold property to the commuters and second-home owners who price the local peasantry out of the market. Britain's biggest builders - Robert McAlpine, Sunley Holdings, Persimmon Homes - are among his backers. So too is the Duke of Devonshire who wants to bring open-cast mining to his Derbyshire estate. These are 'countrymen' who are 'for field sports, not fields', as the International Fund for Animal Welfare neatly put it.  They are also the Tory party on horseback. The Alliance offices are filled with ex-Conservative officials and MPs who lost their jobs in the 1997 massacre. Conservative councillors joined the refinery picket lines. My guess is that the Government's attempts to strike a deal with fuel blockaders before their deadline runs out in 28 days will be futile. Their Tory wing may find it hard to see the political mileage in compromise.  The losers from the hijacking of rural grievance by the estate agents and developers are poor farmers. The best hope for an agricultural industry being crucified by a high pound is early entry to the European monetary union. The Alliance will no more support scrapping the pound than gay marriage or a windfall tax on the oil cartel.  Hunters themselves have respectable arguments against the faux humanitarianism of prohibiting hunting with dogs but not with guns. They might ask that if the language of socialism is the language of priorities, what seriously radical Labour Party would waste a moment on fox hunting after 18 years in opposition? They could, and indeed have, concluded that their opponents are more concerned with persecuting hunters than saving foxes.  For all that, the reasons to tolerate hunting have been destroyed by the hunting lobby. Any civilised person who has gaped at its bigotry can only shrug and mutter: all persecution is fine by me.    <B>And the biggest criminal is ... the governor, apparently</B>As our politicians are meant to be eager to save us from crime, you might have thought that a prison governor who managed to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens would be f&ecirc;ted.  Yet Eoin McLellan-Murray, the governor of Blantyre House, was loathed. He ran a prison with the lowest number of positive drug tests of any jail in Britain. It didn't help him.  Just 8 per cent of his inmates reoffended on release. The achievement served only to goad his enemies. In April they organised a raid by 80 officers dressed as if they were a Swat team breaking up a terrorist cell. McLellan-Murray was suspended and his jail was ransacked.  His offence was to run a liberal prison which prepared inmates for release by letting them work for Kent employers and charities.  Given the jail's success, reasons had to be found for destroying its regime. Martin Narey, the Director General of the Prison Service, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee in May that he had confidential intelligence of villainy in the jail which he couldn't discuss for fear of prejudicing criminal investigations. Kent Police said there were no criminal investigations.  His officers had uncovered stolen goods and escape equipment as they tore through the cells, Narey continued. He did not tell MPs that 'stolen' bank cards were the legally held property of working prisoners and the escape equipment was the tools of a prisoner who was repairing a Mencap charity shop.  This week the Home Affairs Committee will call Narey back to explain himself. Understandably, he has asked to give his evidence in secret. I hope the MPs will turn him down and ask why they were spun dark tales of criminal conspiracy and contraband which cannot be substantiated.  They should also inquire about the fate of the governor. Since the biggest raid in the recent history of the Prison Service failed to find anything McLellan-Murray need be ashamed of, he has been subjected to months of interrogation by Home Office hardliners desperate to find a justification for zero tolerance reduced to absurdity.  Last week, they gave us their best shot. Harry Fletcher, the spokesman for the probation officers union, reports McLellan-Murray will face disciplinary charges of failing to account for the purchase of a gas cylinder worth £110, two electric sockets priced at £8.56 and a £500 donation to the mentally ill from the prison's charitable funds.  He is not being accused of pocketing the money. It is merely that he or one of his subordinates didn't fill out the right forms when they dealt with the paperwork. For these terrible sins, one of the finest public servants in the Home Office will see his career wrecked while Narey's flourishes. 'Scandal' is an overused word by hacks, but in this instance no other will do.","The Daily Star's initial verdict on Charles and Camilla was too downbeat. 'Boring Old Gits to Wed' does not do justice to a legal maelstrom featuring a register office boycott by the Queen, who has allegedly also shelved plans for a banquet. Instead, the sporran polishers of the royal household will be rustling up bite-sized pork pies and warm Lambrusco. Some monarchists blame this 'shambles' on Tony Blair. In their view, his poor advice on wedding protocol betokens a contempt for royalty almost tantamount to back-door abolition. The Queen might certainly have expected a Prime Minister entitled to declare wars in her name to check, in return, whether a licence for Windsor Castle would entitle any old Kev and Bev to plight their troth beneath the Holbeins en route to Legoland.  Otherwise, the executive cannot be accused of negligence. Far from it. On whether the wedding will be lawful, the government has shown the same attention to detail that it applied to the war on Iraq. Both verdicts followed the celebrity chef school of jurisprudence, under which a brace of versions that someone prepared earlier is reheated with new finishing touches.  On the war, two old UN security council resolutions - 678 and 687- were conflated with a new one - 1,441 - to make the legal case. For the wedding, the Marriage Acts of 1836 and 1949, both appearing to preclude royal civil weddings, were laced with the Human Rights Act 1998, which affirms that adults may marry as they wish.  The difference is that Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, has publicly given his view that the marriage would be legal after others, including a former Tory   attorney general, said it might not. By contrast, the government still refuses to publish the current attorney's full advice on Iraq, despite mounting pressure.  But the point, beyond that discrepancy, is not whether the attack was legal (which it was not) or whether the marriage is lawful (a more mixed verdict). The issue is that the legal status of a bloody war has, over the past week, had less media coverage than the legitimacy of a marriage between middle-aged co-habitees.  This imbalance does not support the idea of an irrelevant or dying monarchy. Some royalists think Charles can never now be king; republicans say a clan so reviled by its fans must be tumbrel-fodder. But the Windsors are admirably performing one function of heads of state: that of defining who we are.  It is not a good picture, of Britain or of a family that makes  Shameless  look patrician. Charles's household, bedevilled by royal butler trials, employment tribunals and rape allegations, is presided over by a future king allegedly accused by his ex-wife of wanting to bump her off.  But the bystanders don't sound too pleasant, either. Father Paul Williamson of Feltham, Middlesex, who thinks it 'heresy and apostasy' to ordain women priests, intends to be at the ceremony and object out loud if his formal bids to halt proceedings are ignored. Other hecklers may turn up, egged on by frothing constitutionalists and commentators enjoying some down-and-dirty royal baiting. The Queen, in a reasonable decision, won't be there.  That is not to justify her handling of this mess. A monarch happy to sign a football and visit a drive-thru McDonald's should have welcomed the mix-up under which licensing Windsor Castle would have opened it to other people's weddings. Why not? The Windsors, who fleece visitors for inspecting treasures that belong to the nation, should not suddenly behave as if the paying public are scummy peasants likely to carve their initials in the perpendicular Gothic   or stick their gum on the van Dycks. In opting instead for a register office open to any befrocked pseudo-terrorist who wants to kiss Prince William, the royals might as well have issued gilt-edged invitations exactly to hoi polloi they wanted to exclude. They have also, inadvertently, created the sort of royal family Britain purports to want.  A bickering chavocracy that marries in register offices should suit advocates of a bicycling monarchy. But suddenly, a finger buffet, with all that subtext of pastel Crimplene and gift-wrapped toasters, strikes the media as too naff for words. Why no glass coaches and spit-roast Highgrove stag? Where is the self-respect of a country that may not be able to run a food standards agency but which defers to no one on choreographing a fairytale royal wedding? At the heart of the Windsors' survival is a snobbery that permeates society.  The current fuss has also conferred on them a new and powerful role. The real function of this monarchy is to be the lightning conductor for national loathing. Britain, in common with much of Europe, combusts too much hatred seeking a permissible outlet. In an age of fear, citizens are formally encouraged by government to accept people who represent otherness, such as immigrants and asylum seekers.  But those messages come laced with insidious hints of warning. From the terrorist suspect who cannot be charged to the exploited foreign worker and the disturbed child hauled before the courts, the country   is full of targets for a poisonous, if furtive, dislike. So how cathartic to have the royals, a conduit for collective cruelty and the only legitimate locus for upfront detestation. Obviously, this bloodsport is media-driven. Many Britons have no view on Charles's petulance or Camilla's cellulite and wish the royal story would go away, or at least switch from the personal to the institutional.  For the Windsors' sake, and ours, the government should act fast. As Lord Lester and others recommend, it should pass a brief bill formally sanctioning the legality of the marriage and so heading off inevitable challenges. Then Tony Blair should point out to Charles that the wedding got its initial figleaf of legality only because of a human rights act the prince once denounced as 'a threat to sane, civilised and ordered existence'. That legislation rules that royals must be treated like any ordinary citizen. In recognition, the prince should, like any ordinary citizen, pay his taxes, live within his means and be banned from sponging shamelessly off the state.  Short term, this democracy is stuck with the Windsors. The hereditary principle may be indefensible but, even at the current low point, only 23 per cent of respondents to a YouGov poll want the monarchy to die with the Queen. Until there is enough public enthusiasm for an elected head of state, reform and some kindness are better than a baying mob, in which sneering republicans stand shoulder to shoulder with hardcore evangelicals and Diana loyalists who think Camilla a Medusa in hunting pink.  Spite risks damaging Britain far more than our venal royals, who are never much dented by periodic fits of dislike. On the contrary, unpopularity may work to the advantage of an institution still capable of inspiring national unity, albeit of the ugliest kind. When, eventually, the monarchy perishes, its death certificate will cite as cause not public rage but the indifference of a grown-up country."
1,"What should be done with Maff?"" cried Ian Willmore, media coordinator for Friends of the Earth. '""What should be done with Maff? Maff should be shot in the head, dumped in a trench, fried to a cinder, sprinkled with quicklime and buried with a stake through its heart, that's what should be done with Maff ...and you can quote me on that if you want.""In normal circumstances quotation would be all but pointless. Willmore would be a voice from the green fringe, which could be dismissed by those whose opinions matter with the killer condemnatory sentence: 'No one takes him seriously.' Not this time, I think. The foot and mouth epidemic has had the cheering effect of shifting the fringe to the mainstream.  I've never found New Labour politicians and advisers as furious or as willing to talk to Leftie hacks. Undoubtedly the anger has been caused in part by the postponement of elections. But it is elevated by a less partisan contempt for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a determination that it should share the fate of millions of beasts. 'We've learned the hard way that the department which gave us BSE is the last organisation you want on your side in a crisis,' said one.  The official line is that the fall in the daily count of new cases shows that the slaughter programme is 'beginning to bite'. No one wants to contradict guarded optimism in public. In private, however, many worry about spread rather than numbers. There may be fewer outbreaks but they are popping up all over the country - in Shropshire, Cornwall, and the Peak District. This does not look like an emergency which has been contained. Above all, the strength of the disease in Cumbria terrifies officials. ""I don't know if we can stop it sweeping across to the Humber, however many animals we slaughter,' said one member of the Downing Street crisis team. 'We may have to think about vaccination again.""Opposition to vaccination is the ruling passion of the National Farmers' Union and Maff (the NFU's political wing). If their dogma is overturned both will be humiliated and Maff may die of shame and be replaced by a Ministry for Rural Affairs. Sticking to slaughter until the last cow dies in the last ditch suits their interests, but administrative convenience may not be enough to save Maff when New Labour's confrontation with the Ministry has been so disillusioning.  The party came to power as modernisers. In agriculture, as in so much else, 'modernity' meant more of the   same. A party adviser described Maff as a dumping ground for civil servants. The wages were lower, the chances of moving on to a better job in Whitehall non-existent. A posting to Maff was the bureaucratic equivalent of a Politburo order to take up duties at a Mongolian power station or - to mix continents, and quite possibly metaphors as well - to check in for an indefinite stay at the Hotel California. ""It was a secretive, depressed place,' he said, 'very suspicious of change, very defensive. New Ministers and new permanent secretaries can't stop the treacle layer of senior civil servants trapping new ideas."" Jack Cunningham, the first Labour Agriculture Minister, at least tried to change the privileges granted to the NFU by the Tories. He also noticed that while his office was a 10 feet square coop without a desk, senior civil servants were housed in some splendour. Cunningham made a fuss and the stories about 'Junket Jack', which were to help finish his career, duly appeared. The Civil Service can be vicious when crossed. 'Expect articles about how Nick Brown failed to heed the sound advice of righteous officials to surface within days,' my new friend predicted.  Back-covering briefers will have to work hard. The suicidally honest Michael Meacher blurted out last week that there will be an inquiry when the mess is finally cleared up and was reprimanded for telling the truth. When it comes, as it will, the investigators must ask: why a Maff inspector missed the initial outbreak? Why animal movements were allowed for four days after foot and mouth was discovered? When did Maff officials warn Ministers that trouble was coming? Why were misleading figures on detection and slaughter rates fed to Downing Street? How rigorous was Maff in cracking down on the 'black sheep' smuggling market of subsidy-fiddling farmers? And why was the conclusion that the Army and epidemiologists should be called in at once, which had been reached by the inquiries into the 1967-68 outbreak, ignored?  The last question has provoked many accusations in the past few days. But exiles from Maff argue that it should be rephrased. 'Someone should look at all the contingency plans from '68 to the present day,' said one, 'and try to spot the differences. My hunch is that there won't be any.'  Maff has been stuck with a slaughter policy since the 1920s when it overrode the protests of small farmers, who saw no need for animals with a minor illness to be massacred, in the interests of big farmers, who wanted to eliminate a disease which reduced auction prices. My colleague Anthony Browne was referred to a study from the 1950s by the Maff   press office when he asked if slaughter was the best policy. It was as if all the modern advances in vaccination had never happened. Macedonia and Albania vaccinated successfully to stop the spread of the disease in 1996. But it has not been considered here for fear it would jeopardise a livestock export market worth a paltry £570 million.  Dissent has its risks. The Elm Farm Research Centre, a Berkshire agricultural charity, had to promise vets anonymity when it asked them to discuss the merits of vaccination. Public exposure would threaten their careers. The slaughtermen in the NFU, meanwhile, are presented as the sole representatives of farmers (just as the Countryside Alliance is presented as sole representative of the countryside) though only 53,000 of the 180,000 farmers in England and Wales are members.  Farmers' organisations who favour vaccination are shut out. Mike Hart of the Small and Family Farmers Alliance told me how he and other small farming groups had tried to get past Maff and into see Blair to argue against mass slaughter. They gave up after 'hitting the   proverbial brick wall'. What we are witnessing is the sanctification of a dubious slaughter policy with little concern for the public interest.  Stephen Tindale, who was Meacher's political adviser at the Department of the Environment until earlier this year, is not surprised. He remembered the Government receiving pathetic complaints from farm workers afflicted with depression, lassitude and chronic muscular pains - the effects, they maintained of organo-phosphate sheep dips. Maff officials dismissed their claims. No one knew if the sheep dip was the culprit, they said, but the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh was on the case. The Institute duly reported that a link between exposure to sheep dip and 'chronic peripheral neuropathy' [damage to the nervous system] was 'suggested' by its research. Whitehall's Committee on Toxicity preferred to bin the report and uphold the reputation of the agri-chemical industry.  They may have been right to do so, I'm not qualified to judge. I do know that a majority of supposedly sovereign consumers do not want GM foods, but public opinion did not stop Maff and Lord Sainsbury bowing to the wishes of the GM conglomerates regardless. Witnesses at Maff meetings described the insouciance of officials as they discussed the slow elimination of organic farming by GM crop contamination.  As with sheep dips and organic food, so with foot and mouth. Many have criticised postponing elections and wrecking the tourist industry for the sake of livestock exports, and counted the price in pounds and votes. Fewer have looked at what I can only call the spiritual consequences. For hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, rambling is an escape from regimentation. They have lost the right to roam. They are being told that the slaughter of Herdwick sheep will transform the open fells of the Lake District into a scrubland no one who has loved Wordsworth or followed a Wainwright guide will recognise - and that the Peak District could follow.  The absence of a public outcry about restrictions on freedom of movement is a sign of deference which is on a par with the ability of Virgin Train directors to appear in public without bodyguards. A more assertive citizenry would wonder why it is that Albania and Macedonia can vaccinate their way out of foot and mouth when we can't.  <B>Email update</B><BR><BR><BR><B>More on the election and foot and mouth</B><BR><B>What's going on?</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR><BR><BR><B>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</B><BR>  <BR>  <BR><BR>","b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday July 17 2005</b><br><br>The comment piece below was wrong to say that the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen was 'delighted' at the attack on the World Trade Centre, describing it as 'a great work of art'. In fact, Stockhausen made a statement to the effect that he believed the devil was still an active force in the world and condemned the attack as 'Lucifer's greatest work of art'. Apologies.<br><br><hr size=""1""><br>The instinctive response of a significant portion of the rich world's intelligentsia to the murder of innocents on 11 September was anything but robust. A few, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, were delighted. The destruction of the World Trade Centre was 'the greatest work of art imaginable for the whole cosmos,' declared the composer whose tin ear failed to catch the screams.Others saw it as a blow for justice rather than art. They persuaded themselves that al-Qaeda was made up of anti-imperialist insurgents who were avenging the wrongs of the poor. 'The great speculators wallow in an economy that every year kills tens of millions of people with poverty, so what is 20,000 dead in New York?' asked Dario Fo. Rosie Boycott seemed to agree. 'The West should take the blame for pushing people in Third World countries to the end of their tether,' she wrote.In these bleak days, it's worth remembering what was said after September 2001. A backward glance shows that before the war against the Taliban and long before the war against Saddam Hussein, there were many who had determined that 'we had it coming'. They had to convince themselves that Islamism was a Western creation: a comprehensible reaction to the International Monetary Fund or hanging chads in Florida or whatever else was agitating them, rather than an autonomous psychopathic force with reasons of its own. In the years since, this manic masochism has spread like bindweed and strangled leftish and much conservative thought.All kinds of hypocrisy remained unchallenged. In my world of liberal London, social success at the dinner table belonged to the man who could simultaneously maintain that we've got it coming but that nothing was going to come; that indiscriminate murder would be Tony Blair's fault but there wouldn't be indiscriminate murder because 'the threat' was a phantom menace invented by Blair to scare the cowed electorate into supporting him.I'd say the 'power of nightmares' side of that oxymoronic argument is too bloodied to be worth discussing this weekend and it's better to stick with the wider delusion.On Thursday, before the police had made one arrest, before one terrorist group had claimed responsibility, before one body had been carried from the wreckage, let alone been identified and allowed to rest in peace, cocksure voices filled with righteousness were proclaiming that the real murderers weren't the real murderers but the Prime Minister. I'm not thinking of George Galloway and the other saluters of Saddam, but of upright men and women who sat down to write letters to respectable newspapers within minutes of hearing the news.'Hang your head in shame, Mr Blair. Better still, resign - and whoever takes over immediately withdraw all our forces from Iraq and Afghanistan,' wrote the Rev Mike Ketley, who is a vicar, for God's sake, but has no qualms about leaving Afghanistan to the Taliban and al-Qaeda or Iraq to the Baath party and al-Qaeda. 'Let's stop this murder and put on trial those criminals who are within our jurisdiction,' began Patrick Daly of south London in an apparently promising letter to the Independent. But, inevitably, he didn't mean the bombers. 'Let's start with the British government.'And so it went on. At no point did they grasp that Islamism was a reactionary movement as great as fascism, which had claimed millions of mainly Muslim lives in the Sudan, Iran, Algeria and Afghanistan and is claiming thousands in Iraq. As with fascism, it takes a resolute dunderheadedness to put all the responsibility on democratic governments for its existence.I feel the appeal, believe me. You are exasperated with the manifold faults of Tony Blair and George W Bush. Fighting your government is what you know how to do and what you want to do, and when you are confronted with totalitarian forces which are far worse than your government, the easy solution is to blame your government for them.But it's a parochial line of reasoning to suppose that all bad, or all good, comes from the West - and a racist one to boot. The unavoidable consequence is that you must refuse to support democrats, liberals, feminists and socialists in the Arab world and Iran who are the victims of Islamism in its Sunni and Shia guises because you are too compromised to condemn their persecutors.Islamism stops being an ideology intent on building an empire from Andalusia to Indonesia, destroying democracy and subjugating women and becomes, by the magic of parochial reasoning, a protest movement on a par with Make Poverty History or the TUC.Again, I understand the appeal. Whether you are brown or white, Muslim, Christian, Jew or atheist, it is uncomfortable to face the fact that there is a messianic cult of death which, like European fascism and communism before it, will send you to your grave whatever you do. But I'm afraid that's what the record shows.The only plausible excuse for 11 September was that it was a protest against America's support for Israel. Unfortunately, Osama bin Laden's statements revealed that he was obsessed with the American troops defending Saudi Arabia from Saddam Hussein and had barely said a word about Palestine.After the Bali bombings, the conventional wisdom was that the Australians had been blown to pieces as a punishment for their government's support for Bush. No one thought for a moment about the Australian forces which stopped Indonesian militias rampaging through East Timor, a small country Indonesia had invaded in 1975 with the backing of the US. Yet when bin Laden spoke, he said it was Australia's anti-imperialist intervention to free a largely Catholic population from a largely Muslim occupying power which had bugged him.East Timor was a great cause of the left until the Australians made it an embarrassment. So, too, was the suffering of the victims of Saddam, until the tyrant made the mistake of invading Kuwait and becoming America's enemy. In the past two years in Iraq, UN and Red Cross workers have been massacred, trade unionists assassinated, school children and aid workers kidnapped and decapitated and countless people who happened to be on the wrong bus or on the wrong street at the wrong time paid for their mistake with their lives.What can the survivors do? Not a lot according to a Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He told bin Laden that the northern Kurds may be Sunni but 'Islam's voice has died out among them' and they'd been infiltrated by Jews. The southern Shia were 'a sect of treachery' while any Arab, Kurd, Shia or Sunni who believed in a democratic Iraq was a heretic.Our options are as limited When Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested for the Bali bombings, he was asked how the families of the dead could avoid the fate of their relatives. 'Please convert to Islam,' he replied. But as the past 40 years have shown, Islamism is mainly concerned with killing and oppressing Muslims.In his intervention before last year's American presidential election, bin Laden praised Robert Fisk of the Independent whose journalism he admired. 'I consider him to be neutral,' he said, so I suppose we could all resolve not to take the tube unless we can sit next to Mr Fisk. But as the killings are indiscriminate, I can't see how that would help and, in any case, who wants to be stuck on a train with an Independent reporter?There are many tasks in the coming days. Staying calm, helping the police and protecting Muslim communities from neo-Nazi attack are high among them. But the greatest is to resolve to see the world for what it is and remove the twin vices of wilful myopia and bad faith which have disfigured too much liberal thought for too long."

'We've learned the hard way that the department which gave us BSE is the last organisation you want on your side in a crisis,' said one.  The official line is that the fall in the daily count of new cases shows that the slaughter programme is 'beginning to bite'. No one wants to contradict guarded optimism in public. In private, however, many worry about spread rather than numbers. There may be fewer outbreaks but they are popping up all over the country - in Shropshire, Cornwall, and the Peak District. This does not look like an emergency which has been contained. Above all, the strength of the disease in Cumbria terrifies officials. ""I don't know if we can stop it sweeping across to the Humber, however many animals we slaughter,' said one member of the Downing Street crisis team. 'We may have to think about vaccination again.""Opposition to vaccination is the ruling passion of the National Farmers' Union and Maff (the NFU's political wing). If their dogma is overturned both will be humiliated and Maff may die of shame and be replaced by a Ministry for Rural Affairs. Sticking to slaughter until the last cow dies in the last ditch suits their interests, but administrative convenience may not be enough to save Maff when New Labour's confrontation with the Ministry has been so disillusioning.  The party came to power as modernisers. In agriculture, as in so much else, 'modernity' meant more of the   same. A party adviser described Maff as a dumping ground for civil servants. The wages were lower, the chances of moving on to a better job in Whitehall non-existent. A posting to Maff was the bureaucratic equivalent of a Politburo order to take up duties at a Mongolian power station or - to mix continents, and quite possibly metaphors as well - to check in for an indefinite stay at the Hotel California. ""It was a secretive, depressed place,' he said, 'very suspicious of change, very defensive. New Ministers and new permanent secretaries can't stop the treacle layer of senior civil servants trapping new ideas."" Jack Cunningham, the first Labour Agriculture Minister, at least tried to change the privileges granted to the NFU by the Tories. He also noticed that while his office was a 10 feet square coop without a desk, senior civil servants were housed in some splendour. Cunningham made a fuss and the stories about 'Junket Jack', which were to help finish his career, duly appeared. The Civil Service can be vicious when crossed. 'Expect articles about how Nick Brown failed to heed the sound advice of righteous officials to surface within days,' my new friend predicted.  Back-covering briefers will have to work hard. The suicidally honest Michael Meacher blurted out last week that there will be an inquiry when the mess is finally cleared up and was reprimanded for telling the truth. When it comes, as it will, the investigators must ask: why a Maff inspector missed the initial outbreak? Why animal movements were allowed for four days after foot and mouth was discovered? When did Maff officials warn Ministers that trouble was coming? Why were misleading figures on detection and slaughter rates fed to Downing Street? How rigorous was Maff in cracking down on the 'black sheep' smuggling market of subsidy-fiddling farmers? And why was the conclusion that the Army and epidemiologists should be called in at once, which had been reached by the inquiries into the 1967-68 outbreak, ignored?  The last question has provoked many accusations in the past few days. But exiles from Maff argue that it should be rephrased. 'Someone should look at all the contingency plans from '68 to the present day,' said one, 'and try to spot the differences. My hunch is that there won't be any.'  Maff has been stuck with a slaughter policy since the 1920s when it overrode the protests of small farmers, who saw no need for animals with a minor illness to be massacred, in the interests of big farmers, who wanted to eliminate a disease which reduced auction prices. My colleague Anthony Browne was referred to a study from the 1950s by the Maff   press office when he asked if slaughter was the best policy. It was as if all the modern advances in vaccination had never happened. Macedonia and Albania vaccinated successfully to stop the spread of the disease in 1996. But it has not been considered here for fear it would jeopardise a livestock export market worth a paltry £570 million.  Dissent has its risks. The Elm Farm Research Centre, a Berkshire agricultural charity, had to promise vets anonymity when it asked them to discuss the merits of vaccination. Public exposure would threaten their careers. The slaughtermen in the NFU, meanwhile, are presented as the sole representatives of farmers (just as the Countryside Alliance is presented as sole representative of the countryside) though only 53,000 of the 180,000 farmers in England and Wales are members.  Farmers' organisations who favour vaccination are shut out. Mike Hart of the Small and Family Farmers Alliance told me how he and other small farming groups had tried to get past Maff and into see Blair to argue against mass slaughter. They gave up after 'hitting the   proverbial brick wall'. What we are witnessing is the sanctification of a dubious slaughter policy with little concern for the public interest.  Stephen Tindale, who was Meacher's political adviser at the Department of the Environment until earlier this year, is not surprised. He remembered the Government receiving pathetic complaints from farm workers afflicted with depression, lassitude and chronic muscular pains - the effects, they maintained of organo-phosphate sheep dips. Maff officials dismissed their claims. No one knew if the sheep dip was the culprit, they said, but the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh was on the case. The Institute duly reported that a link between exposure to sheep dip and 'chronic peripheral neuropathy' [damage to the nervous system] was 'suggested' by its research. Whitehall's Committee on Toxicity preferred to bin the report and uphold the reputation of the agri-chemical industry.  They may have been right to do so, I'm not qualified to judge. I do know that a majority of supposedly sovereign consumers do not want GM foods, but public opinion did not stop Maff and Lord Sainsbury bowing to the wishes of the GM conglomerates regardless. Witnesses at Maff meetings described the insouciance of officials as they discussed the slow elimination of organic farming by GM crop contamination.  As with sheep dips and organic food, so with foot and mouth. Many have criticised postponing elections and wrecking the tourist industry for the sake of livestock exports, and counted the price in pounds and votes. Fewer have looked at what I can only call the spiritual consequences. For hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, rambling is an escape from regimentation. They have lost the right to roam. They are being told that the slaughter of Herdwick sheep will transform the open fells of the Lake District into a scrubland no one who has loved Wordsworth or followed a Wainwright guide will recognise - and that the Peak District could follow.  The absence of a public outcry about restrictions on freedom of movement is a sign of deference which is on a par with the ability of Virgin Train directors to appear in public without bodyguards. A more assertive citizenry would wonder why it is that Albania and Macedonia can vaccinate their way out of foot and mouth when we can't.  <B>Email update</B><BR><BR><BR><B>More on the election and foot and mouth</B><BR><B>What's going on?</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR><BR><BR><B>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</B><BR>  <BR>  <BR><BR>","There is hard news and soft news, according to the sainted John Humphrys. (He likes the hard stuff; his BBC employers have gone soft at Six). But you can split categories of news every which way - including, as Mo Mowlam might add, real news; the news where reality bites. Consider: I'm sitting a few weeks ago with a very senior copper discussing the aftermath of the Jill Dando murder. Where did the hit man buy his gun? Surely Jack Straw's dynamic ban on gun ownership has made the whole firearms scene much tighter?  Not really, says top cop reflectively. He can rattle out a long list of pubs where anyone with a wad of fivers can pick up a pistol in 30 minutes flat. Laws don't get in the way of trade. The Straw package may make life tougher for deranged amateurs: fewer guns in legal circulation mean fewer fumbling fingers on triggers. But don't, for a second, suppose that the professionally determined are much incommoded. There's a sharp bang a couple of streets away as I leave. A dodgy exhaust - or a touring Yardie?  In other words, if you want a gun and know where to look for it, the underworld is your oyster. Parliament can pass laws till kingdom come - but, for the drug runners, bank robbers and terrorists, life and death continue as though nothing had happened. And if that's true in the east end of London or Manchester Moss Side, it must be even truer in Belfast (where the Straw law, remember, doesn't run anyway).  Did anyone seriously suppose that the Good Friday agreement would lead to complete disarmament along the back alleys and side roads of Northern Ireland? Did David Trimble suppose that the IRA would turn in every last armalite and stash of grenades? Did Gerry Adams suppose that the UVF and the rest wouldn't forget to turn in the hardware under the floorboards?  Of course not. They 're talking symbolism, not reality. See how, across Europe, the Kosovo Liberation Army claims to have met its own disarmament obligations. Nobody believes that - and the murder of Serbs continues unabated. Kosovo, in any case, is a vast dump of weaponry left behind: enough to keep the black markets of the west stocked for years.  Even if the IRA, in some unimaginable circumstance, turned in every last gun tomorrow, it could be up and shooting again in three months. The reality of peace isn't turning revolvers into ploughshares: it is, slowly, painfully, ensuring that fingers slide away from the triggers.  But unreality, alas, is so much easier to play with; the mouthings of unreality glide so much less painfully from political lips. And one unreality feeds on another. Thus the unreality of a symbolic start to disarmament (which wasn't in the agreement to begin with) leads, over stretching time, to a deliberative pause in which our secretary of state is required to deem the ceasefire firm or illusory. Mo Mowlam does what she was always going to do, what she had no option but to do. She deems the process battered but fundamentally intact.  The IRA have not taken up guns again against the army or the police or the leaders of unionism. There has been no return to sectarian killing. The gangs and the protection racketeers are still operating with some brutality. But no Good Friday words on paper ever could or ever will do much about that - just as no words of Straw, transmuted by parliamentary draftsmen, could stop Dando's murderer going to a pub he'd heard about from the friend of a friend. The essential, basic peace remains.  Again: everybody intimately involved knows this. David Trimble, first minister designate of Northern Ireland, knows it. Even the suddenly omnipresent Jeffrey Donaldson, Ulster Unionist MP, knows it. The roars of outrage and threats of legal action, the prating calls for Mo Mowlam's head, are ritualistic and synthetic. They are either a way for weak men of moderate goodwill to hang on to power in the hope that better times will come - or a thinly disguised attempt to wreck the agreement and shelve every vestige of what process remains by men who never wanted peace on these terms in the first place.  The real news is that divide and that debate: not the flummery of fury. And the real issue behind it needs to be put still more starkly - in a way that even John Humphrys might quail over.  Back to my truth-telling top cop. Can we (I once asked him, in the darker days before Good Friday) ever defeat the IRA? Can our army ever bring peace at the point of a gun? Is there a military answer of enforcement and internment and massive policing which is the alternative to accommodation and compromise?  Straight questions: straight answer. No, there isn't an alternative. Good intelligence can abate the violence for a while, but it can't stop it.  There is no law and order solution here (any more than a large army billeted in Kosovo can prevent ethnic cleansings or simple gangsterism). The alternative to the way things are is a return to the way things were.  Two years ago, both sides implicitly recognised that. Nobody was winning and nobody losing. The conflict was just pottering bloodily on, in increasing futility. So there was a halt (perhaps, says my wise copper, only the first of several as the lessons are gradually learned). But time, in the passing, is another enemy here. Men with guns and politicians with restive constituencies forget. They load back the unreality. George Mitchell becomes a strolling player, not a saviour. The words of hope become ever more strained, the deadlines ever more malleable.  The devil of the situation, though, is that the truth of our impotence in all its bleakness can never be voiced openly by those who understand. Neither Tony Blair nor Mo Mowlam can admit the inability of the state apparatus they control to impose a solution - and the Conservatives have all too swiftly forgotten what they learned through 18 bitter years.  The ordinary people of Northern Ireland are left darkling among the posturers and the bigots. The ordinary voters of the rest of the UK are given no chance to tell the minority over the water what they think should be done.  Real news? Real news gives you the real options and the real assessments - and confronts you with the real decisions. Real news gags on the surface show and shrugs off facile connections to four frightened lads in Dungannon. Real news deals in the fundamentals of life and death. Harder than hard, truer than truer. But there isn't, it seems, much of it around - at Six or any other spot on the clock."
1,"As with so much else in Britain, whether or not you believe evil exists depends on your class. Readers of the popular papers have few difficulties accepting that terrible crimes from the murder of James Bulger to the serial killings of Harold Shipman can be explained by evil. But even bishops who read the broadsheets - or the 'unpopular papers' as Kelvin MacKenzie, a former editor of the Sun, once unkindly suggested we should be called - become fidgety in evil's presence. George W. Bush lost what slender chance he had of winning over middle-class liberal opinion when he denounced the 'Axis of Evil'. Politicians who use the word are seeking to 'demonise' enemies by turning them into monsters, argue those who don't think that the leaders of North Korea and Iraq were capable of becoming monstrous without help from others. Tabloid editors are as calculating. They need a constant supply of monsters to keep the paying public in a profitable state of outraged terror.  There's a lot to be said for conventional liberal wisdom. It has been almost comic to watch the effort put into turning Maxine Carr into the next Myra Hindley. She seemed perfect for the part: good-looking in certain lights; dead-eyed; and, apparently, motivated by an unnatural desire to assist her cruel lover in whatever he wanted to do. The shameful spectacle of the Home Secretary rushing to rig the law to prevent Carr's early release from prison last week was the fruit of a lot of hard work by my colleagues. In the end, however, Carr will fail the horror-movie screen test. She didn't help Ian Huntley. She was one of his victims in her own small way: a regular recipient of his beatings. Prison officers, who don't tend to be among nature's bleeding hearts, describe her as a simpleton who is 'as daft as a brush' rather than a sinister manipulator. The Carr case seems to justify fastidious prejudices about the mob and the mob's newspapers. All the unwarranted attention she has received has done is ensure that she will need years of police protection from an ignorant public which has been maddened by a reckless media.  But the public isn't always as ignorant as the hounding of Carr implies. If its concept of evil didn't exist, it would have to be invented to cover the gap in all great crimes between understandable causes and inexplicable consequences.  Take the Bulger murder which dominated the crime debate in the 1990s and helped make Tony Blair Labour leader. All kinds of reasons were advanced to explain why Jon Venables and Robert Thompson slaughtered a toddler. They came from poor homes, their fathers had walked out on them, they had watched Child's Play II, and may have been inspired by the gruesome film. But honest journalists and detectives admitted at the end of the trial that none of the theories they advanced began to explain the cruelty of the killing. From what I hear from people who have talked to the social workers who looked after them in custody, Thompson and Venables can't explain why they did what they did either. There is a gap between cause and effect, and if you don't use the concept of evil to bridge it, you'll have to find another word with the same meaning.  The gap in the case of Thompson and Venables becomes a yawning chasm in the case of Harold Shipman. Because he never confessed, no one can adequately explain how the doctor became a mass murderer. The best journalists can do is say that he was driven to succeed by an ambitious mother who cosseted and petted him. Vera Shipman died suddenly when he was 17, and the shock of her death is meant to have pushed him into depression, drug-taking and, finally, murder. It's a rational theory but its proponents accept that it doesn't begin to account for Shipman's actions.  The families of the patients he killed didn't on the whole share the crass jubilation of David Blunkett and the Sun at news of his suicide. They felt that he had remained in control to the end, and dictated the terms of his own death as he had dictated the terms of the deaths of so many others. Many complained that they had been denied the chance of discovering why their relatives had been murdered. It's no disrespect to them to suggest that if Shipman had come clean, they probably wouldn't have heard an explanation which made sense.  The German-American intellectual Hannah Arendt gave the best reason why not when she invented the phrase 'the banality of evil'. (Her use of the word 'evil', by the way, can be excused by the fact that she was writing in 1961, an unsophisticated time when we hadn't learned that it was sinful to be judgmental.) The occasion for her outburst was the trial of Otto Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. He had organised the deportation of millions to Nazi death camps.  Arendt looked at him and was shocked to discover that 'the man in the glass booth was not even sinister ... The deeds were monstrous, but the doer was quite ordinary, commonplace, and neither demonic nor monstrous.' The worst she could say about him was that he had 'a curious, quite authentic inability to think ... When confronted with situations for which routine procedures did not exist, he was helpless, and his clich-ridden language produced on the stand, as it had evidently done in his official life, a kind of macabre comedy.'   Eichmann was just a good bureaucrat who obeyed orders. When he was in power, he committed unimaginable crimes; when he was on trial he was a shrivelled and ridiculous figure who didn't have the language to explain what he had done to himself, let alone to others.  Evil is banal. Time and again with mass murderers, people expect to see a demon who can inspire awe as well as fear, only to find that they are dealing with a babbling fool. I remember the stir among the journalists in Dunblane when the police announced that they would release copies of letters Thomas Hamilton had posted just before he walked into Dunblane Primary School and massacred 16 children and their teacher. We were sure that they would give us an explanation; a reason which would make sense of the senseless.  The letters turned out to be complaints against the Scouts, who had expelled him 20 years before for minor mistakes during a camping trip to the Highlands. There had been no public disgrace, nothing that could provoke murderous resentment in an ordinary man. Local organisers had simply decided that Hamilton wasn't up to being a Scout leader because boys under his care had gone back to their parents cold and wet after he had made them dig snow holes. Hamilton must have thought that when people read the letters they would understand why he had to commit an atrocity and then kill himself; that comprehension would lead to a posthumous pardon. The effect was the precise opposite: readers were mystified and contemptuous. All that for this?  Huntley, Shipman and Hamilton were petty offenders compared to the great criminals of our times. But the pattern remains the same. The shock which followed the arrest of Saddam Hussein was the shock of being confronted with banality. Here was a leader who had sent armies roaming across the Middle East, who had produced the death of a million in foreign wars and hundreds of thousands in domestic oppression, who had enforced a cult of the personality it was fatal to dissent from, who had forced four million people into exile, who had been indulged by the West, the Soviet Union and the Arab world and who was, at the end of a lifetime of terror, just a dirty old man cowering in a hole.  Like the families of Shipman's victims, Saddam's subjects will want an explanation. They're unlikely to get one from their former tormentor. Adel Abdul-Mehdi, a Shia politician, confronted the tyrant after his capture. What about the 300,000 corpses found in mass graves since the end of the war, he asked?  Like Hamilton, Saddam assumed that even the relatives of the dead would have to concede that there were good grounds for the executions. 'Ask their families,' he replied. 'They were thieves and they ran away from the battlefields with Iran and the battlefields of Kuwait.'  Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress, watched the exchange and noted that Saddam was 'not remorseful at all. It was clear he was a complete narcissist who was incapable of showing remorse or sympathy to other human beings.'  And that, I think, is about as near as you can get to defining evil. It is pure selfishness and pure thoughtlessness. Once a Shipman or a Saddam has been overthrown, the only point worth dwelling on is how on earth the rest of us let them get away with murder for so long.","At the height of the fuel crisis, Margaret Beckett denounced that part of conservative Britain which tolerated elections only when they brought victories to the Right. 'There is a group of people in this country who passionately believe... that there is something terribly, terribly wrong about having a Labour government,' she said. 'Labour ought never to be in power and if we are we ought to fail.' She was ridiculed as a barking conspiracy theorist by those who forgot the plots of MI5, retired colonels and Napoleonic tycoons against the Wilson administrations, but not by those who have been keeping an eye on the Countryside Alliance. The Alliance's fight to save hunting is no longer being waged with vaguely rational arguments. Enter its collective mind and you are in a war of national liberation against an alien and depraved dictatorship. If you think I'm exaggerating, ask how Sam Butler, the Alliance's chairman, could bellow without a blush to a demonstration outside the Labour Party Conference: 'Our forefathers didn't fight Hitler to have this lot take away our liberties.' One of Butler's forefathers was 'Rab' Butler. He didn't fight Hitler, he appeased him throughout the Thirties and then aided Lord Halifax's manoeuvres to force Churchill to come to terms with the Nazi in 1940. His grandson cannot spot the difference between a Government which is reluctantly allowing a free vote on hunting in response to overwhelming public and backbench pressure, and a totalitarian invader.  Because Parliament will sooner or later ban hunting with dogs, the MPs who support the new Hitler must be presented as human filth; unnatural and unEnglish politicians who have forfeited the right to legislate.  The magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog, for example, which carries the Countryside Alliance's logo, said of Ben Bradshaw, the gay Labour MP for Exeter: 'Fortunately most people are still totally revolted by such lifestyles. Let us not forget the money the health service is forced to spend on the treatment of Aids - the gay plague.<I>Do we really deserve to have such people rule us and tell us what to do ?'</I> Bradshaw's black colleague, Oona King, meanwhile was 'typical of her species'. She was told to 'direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts [the editorialist means the London poor King represents, not farmers]. <I>She has no right to interfere in my life or anybody else's, apart from the deadbeats who helped send her to Parliament.'</I> Butler has told his troops that the Government's record was one of 'terrorists released, rioters allowed to roam the streets wreaking havoc and destruction, whilst the authorities look on'. The Alliance 'has made it clear to Parliament and public alike that we have been resolute in our determination to conduct our protests within the law.<I> However, should Parliament act perversely on the issue of personal freedom, then it will only have itself to blame for what may follow.'</I> (My italics throughout).  As you can see, the anti-hunting campaign isn't only about hunting. The Alliance is a porte-manteau stuffed with every rage against women, gays, blacks, the poor, the Good Friday Agreement ... a damnable modern world turned upside down.  Butler's prediction that hunters will take the law into their own hands if the deviants in Parliament 'act perversely' is already being realised. The provisional wing of the Countryside Alliance is the Rural Action Group. It affects an air of conspiratorial secrecy, while neglecting to take elementary precautions to protect its emails. The most recent warns of the need to 'keep quiet' about its plans for tractor and Land Rover owners to blockade Parliament Square (on 23 October, traffic wardens should note).  If this sounds like an imitation of the tactics of the flying fuel pickets, then the resemblance may be more than coincidental. You do not have to go all the way with Beckett's notion that the oil refinery protests were a plot to be struck by the overlap between the demonstrators, the Countryside Alliance and the Conservative Party. Protesters' cars at the Stanlow oil refinery bore Alliance stickers. Where Tony Blair was confronted with demonstrators in Hull they carried banners crying 'No Hunting, No Petrol'. Liberal commentators responded by dissecting the hypocrisy of supportive Conservative politicians and newspapers who usually demand punitive sanctions against greedy strikers 'holding the country ransom'. But in truth their double-standard charge cut both ways. If Lefties believe urban workers are entitled to take action to protect their livelihoods, how can they criticise farmers suffering in the wors  agricultural depression since the Thirties for following suit?  Honest critics would be forced to hold their tongues if the Alliance and its fellow travellers represented the countryside. Predictably, they do nothing of the sort. Sam Butler isn't a persecuted yeoman, but a millionaire estate agent who has made his fortune by selling Cotswold property to the commuters and second-home owners who price the local peasantry out of the market. Britain's biggest builders - Robert McAlpine, Sunley Holdings, Persimmon Homes - are among his backers. So too is the Duke of Devonshire who wants to bring open-cast mining to his Derbyshire estate. These are 'countrymen' who are 'for field sports, not fields', as the International Fund for Animal Welfare neatly put it.  They are also the Tory party on horseback. The Alliance offices are filled with ex-Conservative officials and MPs who lost their jobs in the 1997 massacre. Conservative councillors joined the refinery picket lines. My guess is that the Government's attempts to strike a deal with fuel blockaders before their deadline runs out in 28 days will be futile. Their Tory wing may find it hard to see the political mileage in compromise.  The losers from the hijacking of rural grievance by the estate agents and developers are poor farmers. The best hope for an agricultural industry being crucified by a high pound is early entry to the European monetary union. The Alliance will no more support scrapping the pound than gay marriage or a windfall tax on the oil cartel.  Hunters themselves have respectable arguments against the faux humanitarianism of prohibiting hunting with dogs but not with guns. They might ask that if the language of socialism is the language of priorities, what seriously radical Labour Party would waste a moment on fox hunting after 18 years in opposition? They could, and indeed have, concluded that their opponents are more concerned with persecuting hunters than saving foxes.  For all that, the reasons to tolerate hunting have been destroyed by the hunting lobby. Any civilised person who has gaped at its bigotry can only shrug and mutter: all persecution is fine by me.    <B>And the biggest criminal is ... the governor, apparently</B>As our politicians are meant to be eager to save us from crime, you might have thought that a prison governor who managed to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens would be f&ecirc;ted.  Yet Eoin McLellan-Murray, the governor of Blantyre House, was loathed. He ran a prison with the lowest number of positive drug tests of any jail in Britain. It didn't help him.  Just 8 per cent of his inmates reoffended on release. The achievement served only to goad his enemies. In April they organised a raid by 80 officers dressed as if they were a Swat team breaking up a terrorist cell. McLellan-Murray was suspended and his jail was ransacked.  His offence was to run a liberal prison which prepared inmates for release by letting them work for Kent employers and charities.  Given the jail's success, reasons had to be found for destroying its regime. Martin Narey, the Director General of the Prison Service, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee in May that he had confidential intelligence of villainy in the jail which he couldn't discuss for fear of prejudicing criminal investigations. Kent Police said there were no criminal investigations.  His officers had uncovered stolen goods and escape equipment as they tore through the cells, Narey continued. He did not tell MPs that 'stolen' bank cards were the legally held property of working prisoners and the escape equipment was the tools of a prisoner who was repairing a Mencap charity shop.  This week the Home Affairs Committee will call Narey back to explain himself. Understandably, he has asked to give his evidence in secret. I hope the MPs will turn him down and ask why they were spun dark tales of criminal conspiracy and contraband which cannot be substantiated.  They should also inquire about the fate of the governor. Since the biggest raid in the recent history of the Prison Service failed to find anything McLellan-Murray need be ashamed of, he has been subjected to months of interrogation by Home Office hardliners desperate to find a justification for zero tolerance reduced to absurdity.  Last week, they gave us their best shot. Harry Fletcher, the spokesman for the probation officers union, reports McLellan-Murray will face disciplinary charges of failing to account for the purchase of a gas cylinder worth £110, two electric sockets priced at £8.56 and a £500 donation to the mentally ill from the prison's charitable funds.  He is not being accused of pocketing the money. It is merely that he or one of his subordinates didn't fill out the right forms when they dealt with the paperwork. For these terrible sins, one of the finest public servants in the Home Office will see his career wrecked while Narey's flourishes. 'Scandal' is an overused word by hacks, but in this instance no other will do."

The families of the patients he killed didn't on the whole share the crass jubilation of David Blunkett and the Sun at news of his suicide. They felt that he had remained in control to the end, and dictated the terms of his own death as he had dictated the terms of the deaths of so many others. Many complained that they had been denied the chance of discovering why their relatives had been murdered. It's no disrespect to them to suggest that if Shipman had come clean, they probably wouldn't have heard an explanation which made sense.  The German-American intellectual Hannah Arendt gave the best reason why not when she invented the phrase 'the banality of evil'. (Her use of the word 'evil', by the way, can be excused by the fact that she was writing in 1961, an unsophisticated time when we hadn't learned that it was sinful to be judgmental.) The occasion for her outburst was the trial of Otto Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. He had organised the deportation of millions to Nazi death camps.  Arendt looked at him and was shocked to discover that 'the man in the glass booth was not even sinister ... The deeds were monstrous, but the doer was quite ordinary, commonplace, and neither demonic nor monstrous.' The worst she could say about him was that he had 'a curious, quite authentic inability to think ... When confronted with situations for which routine procedures did not exist, he was helpless, and his clich-ridden language produced on the stand, as it had evidently done in his official life, a kind of macabre comedy.'   Eichmann was just a good bureaucrat who obeyed orders. When he was in power, he committed unimaginable crimes; when he was on trial he was a shrivelled and ridiculous figure who didn't have the language to explain what he had done to himself, let alone to others.  Evil is banal. Time and again with mass murderers, people expect to see a demon who can inspire awe as well as fear, only to find that they are dealing with a babbling fool. I remember the stir among the journalists in Dunblane when the police announced that they would release copies of letters Thomas Hamilton had posted just before he walked into Dunblane Primary School and massacred 16 children and their teacher. We were sure that they would give us an explanation; a reason which would make sense of the senseless.  The letters turned out to be complaints against the Scouts, who had expelled him 20 years before for minor mistakes during a camping trip to the Highlands. There had been no public disgrace, nothing that could provoke murderous resentment in an ordinary man. Local organisers had simply decided that Hamilton wasn't up to being a Scout leader because boys under his care had gone back to their parents cold and wet after he had made them dig snow holes. Hamilton must have thought that when people read the letters they would understand why he had to commit an atrocity and then kill himself; that comprehension would lead to a posthumous pardon. The effect was the precise opposite: readers were mystified and contemptuous. All that for this?  Huntley, Shipman and Hamilton were petty offenders compared to the great criminals of our times. But the pattern remains the same. The shock which followed the arrest of Saddam Hussein was the shock of being confronted with banality. Here was a leader who had sent armies roaming across the Middle East, who had produced the death of a million in foreign wars and hundreds of thousands in domestic oppression, who had enforced a cult of the personality it was fatal to dissent from, who had forced four million people into exile, who had been indulged by the West, the Soviet Union and the Arab world and who was, at the end of a lifetime of terror, just a dirty old man cowering in a hole.  Like the families of Shipman's victims, Saddam's subjects will want an explanation. They're unlikely to get one from their former tormentor. Adel Abdul-Mehdi, a Shia politician, confronted the tyrant after his capture. What about the 300,000 corpses found in mass graves since the end of the war, he asked?  Like Hamilton, Saddam assumed that even the relatives of the dead would have to concede that there were good grounds for the executions. 'Ask their families,' he replied. 'They were thieves and they ran away from the battlefields with Iran and the battlefields of Kuwait.'  Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress, watched the exchange and noted that Saddam was 'not remorseful at all. It was clear he was a complete narcissist who was incapable of showing remorse or sympathy to other human beings.'  And that, I think, is about as near as you can get to defining evil. It is pure selfishness and pure thoughtlessness. Once a Shipman or a Saddam has been overthrown, the only point worth dwelling on is how on earth the rest of us let them get away with murder for so long.","Last Tuesday morning, every national newspaper - including the Guardian - made the Soham murder trial its front-page lead. Some of the headlines were written in taut American colloquialisms, which, as well as saving space, convey an impression of dramatic urgency. The Manchester United replica shirts, in which Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman died, had been ""binned"". Ian Huntley, the principal defendant, ""took the stand"". The effect was so startling that, for a moment, it seemed irresponsible not to read what one tabloid called ""the chilling details"". Most of the stories were illustrated with two photographs. One was of the bath in which Holly Wells was said to have died. The other - reproduced in colour - showed, half-burned at the bottom of a school dustbin, the shirts in which the girls were last seen. I do not follow murder trails with the care that would make me an authority of their coverage by the press. But I cannot recall any recent prosecution being reported in such detail. And Tuesday was only one day in the continuing saga. In the next week, after the judge has summed up and the jury announced its verdict, we can expect the coverage to be augmented by an avalanche of comment.  Newspapers fill their front pages with stories that they judge will attract readers and increase circulation. So we are required to believe - as a result of last Tuesday's unanimous editorial verdict - that the British public, whatever its general taste in journalism, combines in its enthusiasm for information about human suffering. Accounts of Ian Huntley ""sobbing in court"", admitting responsibility for the two girls' deaths and expressing his bitter regret that he cannot ""turn back the clock"" to the time before they died, apparently sold newspapers. It seems that large sections of the great British public have an inexhaustible appetite for horror.  Newspapers have a duty to report the trial of Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr and the right to describe it in whatever way they choose. In a democracy, justice must be done in public. Newspapers often pretend that their penchant for sensation is essential to the national interest rather than to circulation. But, while we are entitled to deplore their hypocrisy, we should not complain too loudly about the run-of-the-mill revelation and routine expos. They have to sell copies to survive. That explains their readiness to supply the salacious details of murder, rape and assault cases once the stories can be legitimised as court reporting. But what about the demand? There is only one word with which to describe the desire for details of the   Soham tragedy. The word is prurience.  All decent people felt unmitigated horror when they heard the simple fact of the two girls' deaths. And no one who has not endured a similar trauma is fully able to imagine the depth of grief in which their parents must still be engulfed. The Chapmans and the Wellses deserve our unqualified sympathy. Absorption in the squalid details of Ian Huntley's behaviour is a strange way in which to show it. Reading his explanation of how he fitted the girls' bodies into the boot of his car is hardly an expression of condolence. The lawyers have to argue about his conduct. But there is something sick about the casual reader following him on that last tragic journey.  Poring over every detail of the evidence and cross-examination - ""Had you disturbed the clothing of either girl before they went into the ditch?"" - is not very different from standing outside the courthouse in the hope of catching a glimpse of the defendant through the window of the prison van or waiting at Tyburn to see the week's hangings. Last week,   the country was awash with sedentary voyeurism.  The vicarious emotions that the accounts of the trial provoked range from the honourable, through the ignoble to the thoroughly perverse. Sentimentalists will claim that by learning of the two girls' suffering they share the parents' grief and loss. Can they really believe that families bereaved by such tragedies want complete strangers to read the necessarily sordid arguments about their children's last hours? It has to happen in court. And the families have shown admirable courage in being there to see justice done. But they are unlikely to find much consolation in headlines such as ""I put the body in the ditch and rolled her down"".  If people really enjoy reading that sort of thing, there is no way in which we can stop newspapers publishing such stories. Nor, in a free society, should we wish to do so. But I resolutely refuse to believe that fascination with the details of vicious death is an inherent part of human nature. How many sales would a serious newspaper lose if, in the days ahead, it reported the result of the Soham trial unelaborated with the salacious details that we must brace ourselves to expect? Regrettably, we shall never know."

The palace responded that there were no plans to include the Duchess of Cornwall by name, though she was included ""by implication, because churchgoers pray in general to the royal family"" (who knew that?).It's a perfectly defensible decision by the Queen. The marriage between Charles and Camilla has any number of features that aren't particularly reputable - its genesis, for instance.

I'm sure that's not what the divine right of kings was supposed to be about.","Tony Martin should never have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Punishing the Norfolk farmer in this way is an outrage. It offends any sane person's instincts about the meaning of justice. On the spectrum of heinous murders it places Martin at the same point as the Yorkshire Ripper, which is plainly unacceptable. All murderers do not weigh the same in the scales of human wickedness, yet we discover that they are equal before the law. Something very wrong is happening to a man who went too far, with a terrible result, in defending himself and his property. It is obvious, therefore, that politicians should be heard from. They have a duty to say what they would do not only for Martin but for others in similar situations. William Hague had a go at doing that yesterday. Very naturally there has been an outcry, and you don't have to be a Daily Mail reader to experience the indignation that produces it. But one does need to take a little care. Ends and means bear some examination. The very same political instincts that drive Mr Hague to lash out in all directions are the ones that sent Martin to jail for life. Politicians, especially Tory politicians, are accomplices before the fact of the outrage that has now occurred.  For Martin got his life sentence because the judge had no option but to impose it. Ever since the abolition of capital punishment, life has been mandatory for murder. This was the political sweetener that got rid of the gallows, a necessary reassurance to the public at that revolutionary penal moment.  But as the gallows receded, the weakness of the mandatory life sentence became clearer, precisely for the reason that it fails to distinguish between the Ripper and the farmer. By lumping all murders together, it reduces recognition of what is truly heinous, and nullifies the grades of stigma between a desperate act of domestic violence and contract murders by a professional killer.  Over the years, there has been a build-up of studies and reports with detailed argument showing that life should be a maximum and not a mandatory sentence for murder. It would not only be fairer but more effective. The Butler committee said so in 1975, the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1978, the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group in 1986, a House of Lords select committee in 1989. All lord chief justices in living memory have thought that a judge was no less qualified to exercise discretion in murder cases than in others, and to determine a fixed sentence appropriate to the case - retaining life only for the very worst.  If this collective wisdom had been followed, Tony Martin would now be serving a proper and not a repugnant sentence for murder. But the wisdom was spurned by politicians. Although it acquired critical mass in the Tory years, no home secretary would listen to it. David Waddington said removing mandatory life would ""greatly damage public confidence"". Kenneth Baker said that all murder, whatever the circumstances, was more abhorrent than any other crime. Douglas Hurd, an aspirant reformer, said it was impossible to get away from the politics of it. None of them paid attention to their colleague, Lord Chancellor Hailsham, who scorned the mandatory life rule and what he called the ""hairy heel of populism"" that made it apparently untouchable.   The Martin case could be used as a unique moment to turn the hairy heel to advantage. Isn't it the best proof yet available of how mandatory life sentences can offend popular instincts? Couldn't the thorny issues of what is appropriate self-defence and what is reasonable force be dealt with, after the jury has spoken, precisely by the judicial discretion that the mandatory sentence takes away? If, as the tabloids and the Tories scream, a better balance must be struck between wicked criminals and overheated householders with a gun to hand, isn't reform of the blanket life sentence by far the most sensible way to do it?   Not to William Hague. Nor to Jack Straw - though abolishing mandatory life is another penal reform Labour once favoured but now rejects. Instead Hague finds the conventional populist appeal irresistible, and overlooks the penal failures it incessantly produced during the Thatcher-Howard years. In 1996, after all, Michael Howard produced mandatory minimum three-year sentences for persistent domestic burglars, which didn't do much good to Tony Martin. A decade of answering what Hague now righteously calls ""an explosion of anger among millions of law abiding people"" with explosions of anger by ranting politicians had limited success in crime-reduction, and still less in restoring to society a hard sense of the difference between right and wrong.  There are many reasons for that failure: moral decline, godless materialism, social neglect, personal indifference, a duty-free society. For vigilante-ism to be written into law, the remedy Hague comes close to proposing, is insupportable, but people must be able, within the law, to defend themselves proportionately to the threat they face. Martin had an illegal weapon, and committed a shocking crime. The issue is the context, especially the legal context, in which this should henceforth be dealt with. There are sharply contrasting possibilities.  The politicians' way is to pass sweeping laws of ever greater crudity. These are what have put Tony Martin in jail for life, and Hague   wants more of them. They reject individual justice, in favour of grand statements that brush aside particulars. They may catch some serious criminals and send them down for a long time, but people of minor as well as major evil are caught in a penal regime which, more and more over the past decade, has promoted political over judicial decision-making. Life sentences, with discretion over the real time served given to the home secretary, are a burgeoning phenomenon of the British system, now extending well beyond murder. They undermine the notion of justice as a juridical not a political commodity, applying to people not to categories, addressing real lives and not tabloid furies.  The judges' way is different. The judge uses his judgment in all the circum- stances. He can look at Tony Martin and see he's not one of the Krays. Restoring his power to discriminate between one murderer and another would restore justice without imperilling social order in any way. Judges can be as hard as politicians, but aren't locked into a system that guarantees injustice. Actually, they will get their power back. As the Bulger case showed, political intervention in sentencing is beginning to seep away, because it violates the European human rights convention. This will retrieve some sanity. But not before the Martin case has sent politicians raging in the wrong direction.  <A"

One time, when he was younger, he drank quite a lot, and his father made some noises about putting him in rehab. Now we're talking about it, I can't remember whether or not he did go to rehab, but I remember thinking it was the most ludicrous thing I'd ever heard, putting someone in rehab over a couple of Smirnoff Ices; you might just as well put someone in Broadmoor for killing a squirrel.He once went to a fancy-dress party disguised as a Nazi. He thought this was funny; a lot of people called it controversial. I found it impossible to determine why it would be either funny or controversial. (Really, unless it's the pelt of a creature you care about, who could care less what aristos wear to parties?) I know that he regrets wearing the outfit sincerely, according to some interview he gave to a TV company, which wasn't the BBC, whom he snubbed with his seminal coming-of-age message. He likes motorbikes, and has been photographed by Mario Testino with some grime on his face, looking like a young Marlon Brando, except in the respect of having any charisma, or beauty, or sex appeal. He used the word ""arse"", apropos of his time at Sandhurst. And, er, that's it.Contrary to popular wisdom, there is a much more serious image crisis in the younger generation of this family than there is in the older. However much the Queen or Prince Charles might be accused of being ""out of date"", starchy, slightly ridiculous, overfond of pets, they can get away with it, since they belong to a reticent generation. The young ones, however, are required to be accessible yet special. Having no special talents, their speciality must be something basically impossible - a classless version of aristocratic superiority; a faith-free version of divine right.They have been hailed as the great white hope, this generation, free from the tang of the seamy love hexagons that beset their parents, bringing with them a new informality and a new approachability, but it's those very qualities that make them even less viable than their forebears. Make your minds up, chums - do you want to be just like one of us, mucking in with your Sandhurst minions and swearing with the best of them, or do you want to be a breed apart? And if you're not the second, on what possible grounds would we laud you as the first?Politely aware of this tricksy business, our media construct certain fictions around these people to keep them afloat. The first is that they are beautiful. Everyone from Zara Phillips through Princess Beatrice to Prince William has been credited with some physical loveliness, on the basis that beauty is a perfectly comprehensible, modern thing to be celebrated for. Of course, it's wholly bogus; none of them is ever going to put the squeeze on Kate Moss. The second fiction is that their lifestyles are rarefied and unusual for reasons beyond the fact that they spend a lot of money on them. Again, patently bogus. The third is that they occupy an indispensable place in the nation's culture; in fact it is this lie of indispensability that has screwed them, since if they had been allowed to fade quietly into the background, slowly replacing ""engagements"" with actual ""jobs"", and ""apartments"" with actual ""flats"", they would be well on the way to moneyed normality by now.No such luck for young Harry, who has also exclusively revealed that he ""likes to have a laugh"". Our expectations of this family are not real, but that won't stop us making a fuss when they let us down; they couldn't fulfil them even if they were real. Nobody, come to that, is sure what these expectations are, but we'll know, next time a prince goes to a party dressed as a member of the Ba'ath party, what they aren't. It's a thorny, inconsistent business that seems to preclude almost all kinds of laugh. Would it not be easier just to pay tax?"

""So just what is wrong with the Prince of Wales,"" probed Richard Kay. Well, it's pretty obvious isn't it? He's gone mad. Or worse. ""Friends ... are increasingly concerned about his wellbeing."" Which sounds as if the prince has joined Les Dennis, Winona Ryder, Michael Barrymore and Jeffrey Archer, all of whom have been reported, at various times, to be on ""suicide watch"". If only it were so easy! In jail, where the term originated, suicidal inmates can be checked every hour or more, through a handy peephole. But distressed celebrities are scattered all over the place, often behind closed doors, and quite impossible for their carers in the press to keep tabs on. The safest solution, surely, would be for Lord Rothermere or one of his competitors to establish a sort of celebrity Bedlam adjacent to their newsrooms into which these tragic individuals could be committed for their own good. With the stars monitored 24 hours a day by staff reporters and media mental health experts such as Raj Persaud, we could rest assured that everything was being done to stand between our favourite celebrities and their besetting problems with depression and alcoholism, shop-lifting and overweight and - perhaps saddest of all - crockery."

Would it not be easier just to pay tax?","When the slings and arrows of the lottery deliver up a fortune that is truly outrageous, as onlookers we immediately try to wrestle it into a narrative. Without a narrative, it is just a wonderful stroke of life-changing luck that happened to some other people and didn't happen to us. That's just nauseating  you can't live with that, not even for half an hour. One way to overcome it is to make out that the luck is cursed: the Times yesterday ran with a ""tale of two lottery winners"", in which the super-lout Michael Carroll had his myriad flaws adumbrated yet again, the number of cars he's crashed given yet again, his ludicrous poetry quoted yet again, to ram home the reassuring message that you can get as lucky as you like, but unless you have some laudable interior qualities you will not stay lucky. This message was reinforced by the contrasting case of Pat Griffiths, a winner so ascetic, so hard-working and unmaterialistic, that although she gave up her job editing the local paper, she hasn't stopped working, hasn't moved house and hasn't spent much more than she (probably) could have borrowed from a bank. ""Why would we want to move?"" she asks, rhetorically, to underline her deserving nature. ""We already live in paradise on earth."" Ah, Bisto. I feel better already. The Daily Mail, today, took a more gnomic stab at making sense of the luck. The married winners, sharing between them £45.5m, are from Newport.

Punishing the Norfolk farmer in this way is an outrage. It offends any sane person's instincts about the meaning of justice. On the spectrum of heinous murders it places Martin at the same point as the Yorkshire Ripper, which is plainly unacceptable. All murderers do not weigh the same in the scales of human wickedness, yet we discover that they are equal before the law. Something very wrong is happening to a man who went too far, with a terrible result, in defending himself and his property. It is obvious, therefore, that politicians should be heard from. They have a duty to say what they would do not only for Martin but for others in similar situations. William Hague had a go at doing that yesterday. Very naturally there has been an outcry, and you don't have to be a Daily Mail reader to experience the indignation that produces it. But one does need to take a little care. Ends and means bear some examination. The very same political instincts that drive Mr Hague to lash out in all directions are the ones that sent Martin to jail for life. Politicians, especially Tory politicians, are accomplices before the fact of the outrage that has now occurred.  For Martin got his life sentence because the judge had no option but to impose it. Ever since the abolition of capital punishment, life has been mandatory for murder. This was the political sweetener that got rid of the gallows, a necessary reassurance to the public at that revolutionary penal moment.  But as the gallows receded, the weakness of the mandatory life sentence became clearer, precisely for the reason that it fails to distinguish between the Ripper and the farmer. By lumping all murders together, it reduces recognition of what is truly heinous, and nullifies the grades of stigma between a desperate act of domestic violence and contract murders by a professional killer.  Over the years, there has been a build-up of studies and reports with detailed argument showing that life should be a maximum and not a mandatory sentence for murder. It would not only be fairer but more effective. The Butler committee said so in 1975, the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1978, the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group in 1986, a House of Lords select committee in 1989. All lord chief justices in living memory have thought that a judge was no less qualified to exercise discretion in murder cases than in others, and to determine a fixed sentence appropriate to the case - retaining life only for the very worst.  If this collective wisdom had been followed, Tony Martin would now be serving a proper and not a repugnant sentence for murder. But the wisdom was spurned by politicians. Although it acquired critical mass in the Tory years, no home secretary would listen to it. David Waddington said removing mandatory life would ""greatly damage public confidence"". Kenneth Baker said that all murder, whatever the circumstances, was more abhorrent than any other crime. Douglas Hurd, an aspirant reformer, said it was impossible to get away from the politics of it. None of them paid attention to their colleague, Lord Chancellor Hailsham, who scorned the mandatory life rule and what he called the ""hairy heel of populism"" that made it apparently untouchable.   The Martin case could be used as a unique moment to turn the hairy heel to advantage. Isn't it the best proof yet available of how mandatory life sentences can offend popular instincts? Couldn't the thorny issues of what is appropriate self-defence and what is reasonable force be dealt with, after the jury has spoken, precisely by the judicial discretion that the mandatory sentence takes away? If, as the tabloids and the Tories scream, a better balance must be struck between wicked criminals and overheated householders with a gun to hand, isn't reform of the blanket life sentence by far the most sensible way to do it?   Not to William Hague. Nor to Jack Straw - though abolishing mandatory life is another penal reform Labour once favoured but now rejects. Instead Hague finds the conventional populist appeal irresistible, and overlooks the penal failures it incessantly produced during the Thatcher-Howard years. In 1996, after all, Michael Howard produced mandatory minimum three-year sentences for persistent domestic burglars, which didn't do much good to Tony Martin. A decade of answering what Hague now righteously calls ""an explosion of anger among millions of law abiding people"" with explosions of anger by ranting politicians had limited success in crime-reduction, and still less in restoring to society a hard sense of the difference between right and wrong.  There are many reasons for that failure: moral decline, godless materialism, social neglect, personal indifference, a duty-free society. For vigilante-ism to be written into law, the remedy Hague comes close to proposing, is insupportable, but people must be able, within the law, to defend themselves proportionately to the threat they face. Martin had an illegal weapon, and committed a shocking crime. The issue is the context, especially the legal context, in which this should henceforth be dealt with. There are sharply contrasting possibilities.  The politicians' way is to pass sweeping laws of ever greater crudity. These are what have put Tony Martin in jail for life, and Hague   wants more of them. They reject individual justice, in favour of grand statements that brush aside particulars. They may catch some serious criminals and send them down for a long time, but people of minor as well as major evil are caught in a penal regime which, more and more over the past decade, has promoted political over judicial decision-making. Life sentences, with discretion over the real time served given to the home secretary, are a burgeoning phenomenon of the British system, now extending well beyond murder. They undermine the notion of justice as a juridical not a political commodity, applying to people not to categories, addressing real lives and not tabloid furies.  The judges' way is different. The judge uses his judgment in all the circum- stances. He can look at Tony Martin and see he's not one of the Krays. Restoring his power to discriminate between one murderer and another would restore justice without imperilling social order in any way. Judges can be as hard as politicians, but aren't locked into a system that guarantees injustice. Actually, they will get their power back. As the Bulger case showed, political intervention in sentencing is beginning to seep away, because it violates the European human rights convention. This will retrieve some sanity. But not before the Martin case has sent politicians raging in the wrong direction.  <A"
1,"The symbol of this Christmas is the noose. Hang my son, says Ian Huntley's mother. Hang Saddam, says almost everyone. The gallows is not an option for Maxine Carr, who is due out of jail next May. The relatively minor nature of her sin, a crime of lies and silence, has not prevented Maxine-haters placing her in a continuum of female she-devils stretching from Medea to Myra. As the great Judaeo-Christian feast approaches, the polarity between good and evil is stark. In modern replays of the Book of Genesis, conducted in settings as diverse as the Old Bailey, a spider hole near Tikrit and your local Odeon, light does not often vanquish darkness. For happy endings, try Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy at the National Theatre or Tolkien's Return of the King.  In real life, evil prevails. Despite George W. Bush's masterclasses on the subject, there is no particular hierarchy of monsterdom. Michael Jackson, facing child sex-abuse charges, may get a politer welcome on his planned visit to the UK than the one extended to the God-fearing President of the United States. Nor is there an obvious logic to the way we treat untouchables.  Saddam's capture inspired a desire for vengeance, certainly, but also an uneasy pity. The dead eyes and prophet's beard drove commentators to plunder the Old and New Testaments as thoroughly as Bush's speechwriters in an effort to discover what their unexpected sympathy represented. The non-religious answer is what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil.  Tyrants and murderers are defined not only by evidence of their actions - in Saddam's case, the toll of Kurdish citizens gassed and of skulls scratched up from mass graves - but by a cruelty of the imagination. Myths of how maniacal despots behave sit uneasily with Saddam's domestic inventory: one can of 7 Up, a bottle of Lacoste Pour Homme cologne, minted toothpicks, Maxwell House coffee and a picture inscribed 'God Bless Our Home'.  The humdrum detail that jars the observer out of unadulterated hatred also operated in the case of Ian Huntley. His conviction for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman was a restrained affair, free of mobs storming the courtroom precinct or screaming 'Kill Him', in an echo of Tyburn. There was little sign of the bloodlust that followed the Moors Murders and the sentencing of James Bulger's killers. Yet few murders have transfixed Britain, and the world, like those of Holly and Jessica.  Their deaths fed a fear corroding society. If two little girls in smalltown England could be lured to their deaths by a trusted neighbour, then no son or daughter is safe. But more than one child is slaughtered every week by a parent and no one notices. Skewed notions of risk are driven by rare crimes and normally articulated in mob venom.  One reason for a more subdued response might be the dignity of the Chapman and the Wells families, who forbore to demand vengeance. In addition, people do not know, and perhaps never will, exactly how the children died. But those facts do not explain why Huntley has escaped bestial status. I asked a hairdresser friend who has been canvassing her clients. 'It's because he looks so normal,' they told her.  Presentability served Huntley well. His convincing manner persuaded underage girls to have sex with him and prosecutors to ignore their cries of rape. The post-trial furore has been directed at police error in logging past complaints against him, but this is not primarily a scandal of bad filing. The lack of heed paid to his record reflects a society that extended more credence and legal rights to plausible men than to abused girls. Even now, if a case is to succeed, prosecutors prefer their victims dead.  The authorities and the public want child molesters to look like proper perverts, in the mould of a snaggle-toothed Roy Whiting, Sarah Payne's murderer, who appeared in the Sun last week under the headline 'Grinning Creature'. Resembling Jack Nicholson in the latter stages of The Shining saves confusion. Irrespective of bureaucratic bungling by police, Whiting was never school caretaker material. He is separate, a monstrous other who, unlike Huntley or Saddam, holds no Caliban's mirror up to the virtuous world. Pious people, along with neglectful officials and prurient newspapers, need not worry about the thin dividing line between the demon and the normal citizen.  Since the Soham trial lacked a monster from central casting, Maxine Carr gets the role. A fellow prisoner has thrown boiling water at her, and the media hold her guilty of murder by proxy. On the night of the killings, Carr was at a party. The outing might, her critics claim, have pushed a jealous Huntley over the brink. 'Kiss of death' screamed the headline over a picture of her embracing a fellow reveller.  That snapshot in a Grimsby disco placed Carr in a pantheon of female monsters, ranging from the Harpies and the Sirens of Greek legend to Rose West. In myth and in distorted reality, women, deadlier than the male, occupy a spectrum between psychopathy and culpability for engineering family breakdown and producing delinquent children. Carr, branded the 'new Myra' and the catalysing agent of evil, was actually a liar whose mistake was to shack up with a murderer.  In being duped by Huntley's charm, she resembled the police, the school staff, the community and the two trusting girls he murdered. She behaved as others might, and for that reminder of our fallibility, more than her mendacity, she can never be forgiven. In a universe where religious language and political discourse collide, Carr is banished forever from the civilised world to reside with the ranks of the dark forces. Their quarters are becoming more cramped than Saddam's bunker.  The expanding army of darkness encompasses murderers and their gullible girlfriends, along with leaders of Iran and North Korea, the shapeless prosecutors of terror and the suspects interned without charge at Guantanamo and Belmarsh. Arbitrary polarities of good and evil, patented by politicians, mesh with a vengefulness in public thinking.  The capital punishment debate stirs again. Huntley should be executed, according to the string-'em-up lobby whose ambitions will never be heeded by any mainstream political party. Hanging Saddam, however, is deemed perfectly acceptable in Downing Street and the impeccably liberal leader columns of the Independent.  Merciful democrats cannot have it both ways. Certainly, Saddam should be tried in Iraq, but for Britain to rubber-stamp a death sentence would be disgraceful buck-passing by an occupying power which must now stand by its principles. Either we support what David Blunkett calls 'judicial murder' or we recognise that the first test of a humane society is the way it treats the most hideous.  Saddam, like Huntley, should spend his life in prison. There they can suffer for their crimes while offering an enduring reminder to those who once armed a tyrant and failed to stop a potential murderer. Denouncing evil is easy. How much harder to recognise that monsters, with their French cologne and high street clothes, not only share our tastes. Good societies must also shoulder some fragment of their guilt.","Today, and for many mornings to come, Linda Walker will be waking up in Styal prison, in Cheshire. There are better places to spend a Sunday. Six women killed themselves there in the space of a year and 41 tried to hang themselves over the last Mother's Day weekend. Mrs Walker, 48, is a teacher and head of year at a school for children with behavioural problems. She has a partner who is a college lecturer, twin sons of 17, a daughter and an elderly father for whom she cooks. Last week, she was jailed for six months after carrying out the sort of fantasy to which some liberals furtively confess. She showed the yobs what fear feels like.  In Mrs Walker's account, her house had been under siege. Bicycles were stolen, fish disappeared from the garden pond and wing mirrors were smashed. An abusive caller said her son was a 'poof' and asked: 'Does he want a good bumming?' On 14 August last year, Mrs Walker snapped when a container of liquid was poured over a family car  After haranguing a group of teenagers, she returned home to arm herself with a Walther CP88 gas-powered air pistol, which she had kept in her underwear drawer since a previous burglary, and an air rifle. Pausing only to phone the police to tell them that she was 'going to shoot the f****** vandals', she fired six times at the ground near an 18-year-old youth.  Exit Mrs Walker, her career almost certainly in ruins, complaining that the law supported 'yobbos and not victims'. The court heard later that she had acted in a moment of madness to defend her family. Anyone could write the script from this point onwards. As mainly right-wing newspapers clamoured for her freedom, Michael Howard made her the official martyr of his campaign to 'put fear into the heart of yobs'.  So far, so predictable, except that the Walker case, far from confirming entrenched opinions, confounds many of them. For a start, conservatives are correct to challenge her sentence. Prison is for those whose crimes are so grave or who are such a danger to the public that no other option is possible. Mrs Walker fulfils neither criterion, and, like thousands of other British women, she should not be there.  Harsh sentencing does not, though, excuse her behaviour or explain it. I have just been burgled and my neighbour had her basement stripped bare three days ago. Neither of us felt impelled to add a Terminator-style armoury to our underwear drawers. In her defence, Mrs Walker was reacting against something more insidious. Kierkegaard called anxiety 'the dizziness of freedom', but nothing makes people feel more unfree than being constantly under threat. And so Mrs Walker, a respectable teacher, staged a conversion almost as startling as if Miss Jean Brodie had become a Clockwork Orange droog.  Greater Manchester, where Mrs Walker lives, does not resemble Kubrick's urban nightmare. Indeed, the showcase for the government's anti-yob strategy should be getting safer by the day. No other police force has been so eager to hand out antisocial behaviour orders, making the patch the Home Office's model of good practice. In a six-month period last year, 155 people were Asboed, compared with 27 in Merseyside.  Mrs Walker's story, and her son's claim that she had vainly asked the police 15 times for help,   offers only an isolated example that all is not well in Asboland. But then the government, despite the focus on expanding its crackdown, hasn't been very scientific either. We know that a third of orders are breached and that two-thirds of those sentenced for failing to comply are sent to jail. There are worrying reports of children who are mentally ill or frail being criminalised. But six years and 4,000 orders after the policy's inception, there is not a single longitudinal study to show whether the orders stop bad behaviour or, as many experts on youth crime believe, make it worse.  That question matters more than pre-election chatter allows. The jailing of Linda Walker may be unjust, but it is much less alarming, in the story of badland Britain, than the spate of child offenders currently appearing at the Old Bailey. Last month alone, three schoolboys stood trial for murder there. One in 10 12-year-old boys and a quarter of 16- years-old boys have gone out armed in the last year.  Fear is for bigots and for politicians more adept at conjuring despair than dreams. Michael Howard talks up terror. The Archbishop of Canterbury knocks it down. Liberals, appalled by being asked to beware the gypsy, the asylum seeker, the immigrant and the kid outside the chip shop, think dread a disreputable emotion. But suddenly I am afraid.  My fear began when Hakeem Johnson, aged 13, walked into my local takeaway and stabbed a young manager to death because he would not serve him a £1 pizza after a special offer had ended. I am not personally frightened of Johnson's friends, whom I probably brush past often in the Holloway Road, but I am scared by the statistic that three-quarters of boys excluded from school, as he was, have used a weapon. I am disturbed that a teaching union   has reported a surge in classroom violence, and the government must be anxious, too, because the Schools Minister last week announced a knife amnesty to tackle the 'hugely disturbing' culture of weapons.  But most of all, I am alarmed that, despite the overall fall in crime, a new mood of casual cruelty is fermenting in cities where the problems, and solutions, are mostly arcane and intractable. Atrocious families and deprivation are nothing novel and the government has done some good things to tackle both; 100,000 children lifted out of poverty last year is not enough, but it is slow progress.  So why the knives and the gangs of teenagers practising the elastic-hipped swagger of the pretend assassin? Why the wave of rapes and murders combining adult savagery and the capricious pointlessness of childish rage?  I do not know and nor does the government. But I think, and so do charities working in the field, that a society driving wedges between adult authority and alienated youngsters can only ignite the problem of children who evolve so fast from victims to aggressors.  That is not to suggest that the mean streets of Greater Manchester and elsewhere can be sanitised by a combination of table tennis and a willingness by law-abiding citizens to have their lives made miserable in the interest of community relations. But neither is it right to beat the drum of punishment and exclusion while saying so little about positive intervention.  Linda Walker's jailing was not only extreme. It also helped reinforce the narrative, only patchily accurate, about a middle class terrorised by yobs. Politicians like that story. It strikes a chord with anyone who has had their windows smashed or their geography class made hell. It offers slick solutions to the genuinely persecuted. And it stops anyone asking whether today's tearaways are being officially groomed for tomorrow's knife gangs."

Tyrants and murderers are defined not only by evidence of their actions - in Saddam's case, the toll of Kurdish citizens gassed and of skulls scratched up from mass graves - but by a cruelty of the imagination. Myths of how maniacal despots behave sit uneasily with Saddam's domestic inventory: one can of 7 Up, a bottle of Lacoste Pour Homme cologne, minted toothpicks, Maxwell House coffee and a picture inscribed 'God Bless Our Home'.  The humdrum detail that jars the observer out of unadulterated hatred also operated in the case of Ian Huntley. His conviction for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman was a restrained affair, free of mobs storming the courtroom precinct or screaming 'Kill Him', in an echo of Tyburn. There was little sign of the bloodlust that followed the Moors Murders and the sentencing of James Bulger's killers. Yet few murders have transfixed Britain, and the world, like those of Holly and Jessica.  Their deaths fed a fear corroding society. If two little girls in smalltown England could be lured to their deaths by a trusted neighbour, then no son or daughter is safe. But more than one child is slaughtered every week by a parent and no one notices. Skewed notions of risk are driven by rare crimes and normally articulated in mob venom.  One reason for a more subdued response might be the dignity of the Chapman and the Wells families, who forbore to demand vengeance. In addition, people do not know, and perhaps never will, exactly how the children died. But those facts do not explain why Huntley has escaped bestial status. I asked a hairdresser friend who has been canvassing her clients. 'It's because he looks so normal,' they told her.  Presentability served Huntley well. His convincing manner persuaded underage girls to have sex with him and prosecutors to ignore their cries of rape. The post-trial furore has been directed at police error in logging past complaints against him, but this is not primarily a scandal of bad filing. The lack of heed paid to his record reflects a society that extended more credence and legal rights to plausible men than to abused girls. Even now, if a case is to succeed, prosecutors prefer their victims dead.  The authorities and the public want child molesters to look like proper perverts, in the mould of a snaggle-toothed Roy Whiting, Sarah Payne's murderer, who appeared in the Sun last week under the headline 'Grinning Creature'. Resembling Jack Nicholson in the latter stages of The Shining saves confusion. Irrespective of bureaucratic bungling by police, Whiting was never school caretaker material. He is separate, a monstrous other who, unlike Huntley or Saddam, holds no Caliban's mirror up to the virtuous world. Pious people, along with neglectful officials and prurient newspapers, need not worry about the thin dividing line between the demon and the normal citizen.  Since the Soham trial lacked a monster from central casting, Maxine Carr gets the role. A fellow prisoner has thrown boiling water at her, and the media hold her guilty of murder by proxy. On the night of the killings, Carr was at a party. The outing might, her critics claim, have pushed a jealous Huntley over the brink. 'Kiss of death' screamed the headline over a picture of her embracing a fellow reveller.  That snapshot in a Grimsby disco placed Carr in a pantheon of female monsters, ranging from the Harpies and the Sirens of Greek legend to Rose West. In myth and in distorted reality, women, deadlier than the male, occupy a spectrum between psychopathy and culpability for engineering family breakdown and producing delinquent children. Carr, branded the 'new Myra' and the catalysing agent of evil, was actually a liar whose mistake was to shack up with a murderer.  In being duped by Huntley's charm, she resembled the police, the school staff, the community and the two trusting girls he murdered. She behaved as others might, and for that reminder of our fallibility, more than her mendacity, she can never be forgiven. In a universe where religious language and political discourse collide, Carr is banished forever from the civilised world to reside with the ranks of the dark forces. Their quarters are becoming more cramped than Saddam's bunker.  The expanding army of darkness encompasses murderers and their gullible girlfriends, along with leaders of Iran and North Korea, the shapeless prosecutors of terror and the suspects interned without charge at Guantanamo and Belmarsh. Arbitrary polarities of good and evil, patented by politicians, mesh with a vengefulness in public thinking.  The capital punishment debate stirs again. Huntley should be executed, according to the string-'em-up lobby whose ambitions will never be heeded by any mainstream political party. Hanging Saddam, however, is deemed perfectly acceptable in Downing Street and the impeccably liberal leader columns of the Independent.  Merciful democrats cannot have it both ways. Certainly, Saddam should be tried in Iraq, but for Britain to rubber-stamp a death sentence would be disgraceful buck-passing by an occupying power which must now stand by its principles. Either we support what David Blunkett calls 'judicial murder' or we recognise that the first test of a humane society is the way it treats the most hideous.  Saddam, like Huntley, should spend his life in prison. There they can suffer for their crimes while offering an enduring reminder to those who once armed a tyrant and failed to stop a potential murderer. Denouncing evil is easy. How much harder to recognise that monsters, with their French cologne and high street clothes, not only share our tastes. Good societies must also shoulder some fragment of their guilt.","Gordon Brown arrived on the front bench in the Commons, laughing and joking with Tony Blair. Laughing and joking? With Tony Blair? Things must be desperate. The prime minister was about to shaft him. And so he did. Shortly after that he told us to expect a referendum on membership of   the euro within - he implied - two years of the election. The chancellor himself would prefer it some time after a giant meteor has wiped out all life on earth. At least that way he'd know the result in advance.  Step back with me two hours in time, to 1pm yesterday. I was at the Channel 4 Political Awards, to be shown at 8pm on Saturday. It'll be a funny show, so catch it if you can, though it goes out at the same time as Casualty. You might find it hard to tell the difference. (""This man's career is hanging by a thread! We need oxygen, a blood transfusion, and a heart transplant!"" ""But doctor, look, the Mandelson case file says 'do not resuscitate!'"")   At my table was Lembit Opik, the LibDem MP who has spent the last few years telling us that the meteor could strike at any time. I asked if we wouldn't have a few weeks' warning, to send up a nuclear device up to smash the rock before it hits us. He said we might get two minutes. What a cheery companion he proved to be.  Jon Snow, the presenter, made a joke about Michael Meacher ""only stopping by to pick up the rent"". That got a big laugh.  Lembit Opik appeared on camera talking about Gordon Prentice, a keen opponent of fox-hunting. He, Lembit, had suggested to him that it should remain legal, but there should be a regulatory   agency called ""Off-fox"". Mr Prentice had replied ""using the same words, but in the reverse order"".  There were some queeny ""whoo, whoos"" from the assembled pols and hacks, but Gordon Brown looked much amused.  Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing, was briefly fooled on air by a phone call from Tony Blair - actually a member of Radio 4's Dead Ringers team. The prime minister would like to visit his constituency. ""I can promise you no tomatoes,"" said Mr Pound, ""but a few kiwi fruits and aubergines, perhaps...""  The next winner was the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley, for his book about New   Labour and their general contempt for the voters. It is said that Gordon Brown was a source for this work, but now regrets telling the author whatever it was he said.  As the oeuvre was being praised, the chancellor looked thunderous. Margaret Beckett, two seats away, smiled a tight little smile.  Mr Rawnsley praised his wife for all her help. ""She is my rock, my comfort and my joy,"" he said. The chancellor's jaw literally hung open. He hugged himself, like someone signalling the maitre d' to bring a strait jacket.  Then Mr Brown himself won the top award of all, for ""the MP who has been the most outstanding figure in the House"". They showed   short clips of people praising him. He looked delighted. Who wouldn't be? Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews declared on the monitors: ""He is an absolutely typical Lowland Scot. He believes in the virtues of toil, and plunder.""  Back in the Commons, Mr Blair was replying to William Hague. Did an early referendum on the euro mean within two years of the next parliament? (The Tory leader seems to have given up any hope of winning.)  ""Early in the next parliament would, of course, be within two years,"" Mr Blair replied. Mr Brown scowled.  Win some, lose some. But he seems to win nearly all the time, so I don't suppose he'll mind too much."

Funerals are difficult. Too basic, and they seem depressing. Too fussy, and they risk vulgarity. One remembers the apocryphal send-off for Woody Allen's grandfather, featuring a buffet table laden with 'a replica of the deceased in potato salad'. Last week, Chatsworth offered its idealised tableau of a British demise. A hearse bearing Andrew Cavendish, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, wound through parkland lined by ribbons of servants in black serge and starched white aprons. The spectacle summarised how the rich die, and how they live. Never, outside a Conrad Black dinner party, have so many below-stairs staff been gathered together. The scene could have been a flashback to the margarine-advert England of Stanley Baldwin, except that Chatsworth's 600 employees are closer to the cast of a club reps docusoap than to old retainers. Most work for the tourist trade, running playgrounds or supplying internet customers with 'Duke's hampers' (price £499, plus £7.95 delivery).  In 1799, the Duke's forebear was the fourth wealthiest man in Britain. Since then, the aristocracy, lacking the wit to invent unopenable milk cartons or flatpack tables, has slithered down the international rich lists. The modern toff has had to compress Adam Smith's three categories of landowner, businessman and labourer into one multi-purpose model. That is why the current Earl of Sandwich is stuffing tuna wraps and why the departing Duke of Devonshire was winged to his rest by short-order chefs from Jean-Pierre's Chatsworth bar.  These days, only tycoons and footballers exist like Bourbon kings. A £700 million lawsuit issued by Hollinger against Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, alleges that the Blacks' excesses included billing the firm for 'household staff, including chefs, senior butlers, butlers, under-butlers, chauffeurs and footmen.' The Blacks' invention of an Almanack de Gotha of the buttling classes intrigued the media less, however, than Lady Amiel-Black's tip to a Bergdorf Goodman store doorman.  It can't have been her creativity that rankled, since many journalists are more inventive with expenses claims. The fascination of the Blacks is, instead, their cocktail of grandeur and frugality, the rich people's traits that others most love to deride. The Duke of Devonshire, a humble man, gave to good causes in the noblesse oblige tradition of the 19th-century landowner, while Hollinger, so its lawsuit claims, paid or promised $250,000 to charities on behalf of Amiel-Black.  The rich are often stingy. Queen Mary was a kleptomaniac who helped herself to knick-knacks from other people's houses, while Ingvar Kamprad, the Ikea founder and the wealthiest man in the world, drives an ancient Volvo. Tycoons have tended, too, towards madness, partly because they can pay others to sustain their worst delusions. Hence the Mormon army employed by the dying Howard Hughes to swat any germ-bearing fly entering the airspaces near the sealed room where he lay watching Ice Station Zebra on a video loop.  Though often selfish and sometimes unhinged, the rich have seldom seemed so dislikeable as now. Maybe plutocrats have to try harder to impress. When anyone with a semi in the right bit of inner London is a millionaire, only dollar billionaires feel truly wealthy. And when the middle classes, too upper crust to dust, hire two million servants of their own, the oligarchy needs better status symbols. In the US, the co-founder of Microsoft has just arrived at a New Orleans conference in the world's largest private yacht. Paul Allen's acquisition has a deck the size of Old Trafford, a submarine in the hold and a fuel tank that takes $250,000 to fill. Think Barbara Amiel's charity budget in unleaded diesel.   Lower down the food chain of plutocracy, fat cats are thriving. Luc Vandevelde, of M&amp;S, received a £450,000 annual package for failing to beguile women with polyester suits and this spring's toeless tights. Vandevelde, though sacked, has so many other lucrative boardroom roles that he will barely make it through M&amp;S's five-items-only checkout.  Ken Clarke told me, when he was Chancellor, that he wished business leaders 'would show a decent level of restraint'. His departure from the Tory script was aimed at proto-fat cats such as Cedric Brown, who was paid like one of Lord Black's Shake'n'Vac army in comparison with today's CEOs. Ten years down the line, optimists dare to think that, if Gordon Brown gets to be Prime Minister, he will tax the rich an extra 1 per cent. That wish may be forlorn. So far, the Chancellor's tax and benefit policy has helped the worst-off and lifted 700,000 children out of poverty. But 3.6m others remain poor, and the income gap is being prised apart by a failure to redistribute wealth.  Reluctance to make the rich pay their share is partly down to the awe in which government holds new money. From the Beckhams to a record influx of foreign billionaires, high-rollers are lionised. The moderately wealthy don't complain, partly because a rentier lifestyle, once for the coked-up sons of earls, is now an aspiration for those with a Fulham postcode and a trust fund for the children. Poorer people are not, by instinct, jealous. And even if they were, militancy was neutered long ago by Thatcher.  Helping the rich is part of the national culture, just as buying the Big Issue, or giving money to beggars, is not. Those on average incomes tend to be embarrassed by the impoverished, while   cheerfully subsidising affluent dependents, such as the royal family. It would be wrong to think that Prince Charles is scaling down the monarchy's extravagance in his current visit to Mount Athos, a remote religious community he uses as a spiritual Champneys. The austere regime is leavened by the prince's habit of arriving, often on a yacht owned by the Latsis dynasty, with 30 suitcases, one police bodyguard, one folding bed, one satellite telephone and several coolboxes of Palace delicacies to replace the monks' inedible bean stew.  Supporting the royals has always been justified, however shakily, by the argument that they work for the public good. New plutocrats do not. With exceptions, such as the Sainsburys, they shirk the philanthropy of their American counterparts, from Rockefeller and Carnegie onwards. Unlike Edwardian aristocrats, they rarely feel compelled, by God, guilt or public duty, to plough an unnecessary penny back into the public domain.  Orwell's moneyed and ruling classes have impacted into one. Nancy Mitford's U and non-U categories are only for snobs with chilblains and defective heating systems. This is a society that disdains rank and prejudice, and which has just been promised a brand new equality commission to uphold high standards. And still, old hierarchies linger.  A hearse goes by, and few scoff at the battalions of retainers that watch it pass, or mock the self-reverence of the rich. Instead, there is a reflex twitch of nostalgia for feudal England. Maybe everyone is suffering from Trollope overload. Or perhaps the revamped squirarchy, custodian of art and purveyor of damson jam online, looks suddenly less alarming than new potentates.","The Daily Star's initial verdict on Charles and Camilla was too downbeat. 'Boring Old Gits to Wed' does not do justice to a legal maelstrom featuring a register office boycott by the Queen, who has allegedly also shelved plans for a banquet. Instead, the sporran polishers of the royal household will be rustling up bite-sized pork pies and warm Lambrusco. Some monarchists blame this 'shambles' on Tony Blair. In their view, his poor advice on wedding protocol betokens a contempt for royalty almost tantamount to back-door abolition. The Queen might certainly have expected a Prime Minister entitled to declare wars in her name to check, in return, whether a licence for Windsor Castle would entitle any old Kev and Bev to plight their troth beneath the Holbeins en route to Legoland.  Otherwise, the executive cannot be accused of negligence. Far from it. On whether the wedding will be lawful, the government has shown the same attention to detail that it applied to the war on Iraq. Both verdicts followed the celebrity chef school of jurisprudence, under which a brace of versions that someone prepared earlier is reheated with new finishing touches.  On the war, two old UN security council resolutions - 678 and 687- were conflated with a new one - 1,441 - to make the legal case. For the wedding, the Marriage Acts of 1836 and 1949, both appearing to preclude royal civil weddings, were laced with the Human Rights Act 1998, which affirms that adults may marry as they wish.  The difference is that Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, has publicly given his view that the marriage would be legal after others, including a former Tory   attorney general, said it might not. By contrast, the government still refuses to publish the current attorney's full advice on Iraq, despite mounting pressure.  But the point, beyond that discrepancy, is not whether the attack was legal (which it was not) or whether the marriage is lawful (a more mixed verdict). The issue is that the legal status of a bloody war has, over the past week, had less media coverage than the legitimacy of a marriage between middle-aged co-habitees.  This imbalance does not support the idea of an irrelevant or dying monarchy. Some royalists think Charles can never now be king; republicans say a clan so reviled by its fans must be tumbrel-fodder. But the Windsors are admirably performing one function of heads of state: that of defining who we are.  It is not a good picture, of Britain or of a family that makes  Shameless  look patrician. Charles's household, bedevilled by royal butler trials, employment tribunals and rape allegations, is presided over by a future king allegedly accused by his ex-wife of wanting to bump her off.  But the bystanders don't sound too pleasant, either. Father Paul Williamson of Feltham, Middlesex, who thinks it 'heresy and apostasy' to ordain women priests, intends to be at the ceremony and object out loud if his formal bids to halt proceedings are ignored. Other hecklers may turn up, egged on by frothing constitutionalists and commentators enjoying some down-and-dirty royal baiting. The Queen, in a reasonable decision, won't be there.  That is not to justify her handling of this mess. A monarch happy to sign a football and visit a drive-thru McDonald's should have welcomed the mix-up under which licensing Windsor Castle would have opened it to other people's weddings. Why not? The Windsors, who fleece visitors for inspecting treasures that belong to the nation, should not suddenly behave as if the paying public are scummy peasants likely to carve their initials in the perpendicular Gothic   or stick their gum on the van Dycks. In opting instead for a register office open to any befrocked pseudo-terrorist who wants to kiss Prince William, the royals might as well have issued gilt-edged invitations exactly to hoi polloi they wanted to exclude. They have also, inadvertently, created the sort of royal family Britain purports to want.  A bickering chavocracy that marries in register offices should suit advocates of a bicycling monarchy. But suddenly, a finger buffet, with all that subtext of pastel Crimplene and gift-wrapped toasters, strikes the media as too naff for words. Why no glass coaches and spit-roast Highgrove stag? Where is the self-respect of a country that may not be able to run a food standards agency but which defers to no one on choreographing a fairytale royal wedding? At the heart of the Windsors' survival is a snobbery that permeates society.  The current fuss has also conferred on them a new and powerful role. The real function of this monarchy is to be the lightning conductor for national loathing. Britain, in common with much of Europe, combusts too much hatred seeking a permissible outlet. In an age of fear, citizens are formally encouraged by government to accept people who represent otherness, such as immigrants and asylum seekers.  But those messages come laced with insidious hints of warning. From the terrorist suspect who cannot be charged to the exploited foreign worker and the disturbed child hauled before the courts, the country   is full of targets for a poisonous, if furtive, dislike. So how cathartic to have the royals, a conduit for collective cruelty and the only legitimate locus for upfront detestation. Obviously, this bloodsport is media-driven. Many Britons have no view on Charles's petulance or Camilla's cellulite and wish the royal story would go away, or at least switch from the personal to the institutional.  For the Windsors' sake, and ours, the government should act fast. As Lord Lester and others recommend, it should pass a brief bill formally sanctioning the legality of the marriage and so heading off inevitable challenges. Then Tony Blair should point out to Charles that the wedding got its initial figleaf of legality only because of a human rights act the prince once denounced as 'a threat to sane, civilised and ordered existence'. That legislation rules that royals must be treated like any ordinary citizen. In recognition, the prince should, like any ordinary citizen, pay his taxes, live within his means and be banned from sponging shamelessly off the state.  Short term, this democracy is stuck with the Windsors. The hereditary principle may be indefensible but, even at the current low point, only 23 per cent of respondents to a YouGov poll want the monarchy to die with the Queen. Until there is enough public enthusiasm for an elected head of state, reform and some kindness are better than a baying mob, in which sneering republicans stand shoulder to shoulder with hardcore evangelicals and Diana loyalists who think Camilla a Medusa in hunting pink.  Spite risks damaging Britain far more than our venal royals, who are never much dented by periodic fits of dislike. On the contrary, unpopularity may work to the advantage of an institution still capable of inspiring national unity, albeit of the ugliest kind. When, eventually, the monarchy perishes, its death certificate will cite as cause not public rage but the indifference of a grown-up country."

The government has done the right thing and the dome gets another chance. Other bidders - now suddenly many more - can come forward and suggest something better than a disgraceful fire-sale at a knock-down price to property developers. It would have been the final scandal of the dome's history. The panic that seized the government at the end of last year is over. There is time to stop and think, time to consider every option - ""as long as it takes,"" says Lord Falconer - no artificial deadlines. But will it be saved as a public space? Now the dome is closed, the spate of bad news that hung over it like a thick smog has lifted. Panic was the danger - the same panic that seized governments before. The Festival of Britain of 1951, besieged by many of the same headlines calling it a monstrous waste of public money, was razed to the ground the day it closed to save further public embarrassment. The incoming Conservative government smashed the Skylon to pieces and bulldozed the Dome of Discovery, both icons that would now be loved and revered landmarks. They couldn't move fast enough to pull down the Crystal Palace after the Great Exhibition of 1851 and remove it to a distant suburb where it later burned to the ground. The moment a great public exhibition closes is the moment when it is least fashionable and least valued. Its value plummets so low people can't even see the value of the land around it. By the time the final deal is done, we will look back on the idea of selling this majestic site for a fraction of its true worth with utter incredulity.  Talking to top London property dealers yesterday, they said there had been a phenomenal conspiracy of silence among the five big property companies who stood by and looked on as Legacy seemed about to be given it almost as a gift. ""We could not believe it,"" said one leading estate agent. Why the silence? Well, it was government business and no one wanted to make trouble, with future contracts in mind. But consider this, said one. Canary Wharf is just 40 seconds' travel time from the dome peninsula. Last November the Canary Wharf Group plc acquired a new 6.3-acre tract of land for development in North Canary Wharf called Shed 35. It cost them £53m. That is the same sum Legacy was proposing to put down on 63 similar acres, with just another £75m to follow later. ""The site value   has soared in the past 20 months since bids were first invited. Now there is a tube and infrastructure, it's a different game."" He reckons a full and fair global competition will bring in a sizeable fortune for the site - and still leave plenty of room for publicly owned space.  Now for round two. This spectacular peninsula is the most beautiful piece of undeveloped urban landscape in the capital, surrounded by the Thames on three sides, under a great wide sky with breathtaking views in all directions. Reached by boat and by one of London's most architecturally exciting new tube stations, this is a dream public space, a park, a treasure. Once sold off and built over, it will be gone for ever, unreclaimable for the public. Richard Rogers, architect of this mighty white structure, is one of those who has been fighting hard behind the scenes to keep it as a publicly owned place for ever. If the Skylon, the Dome of Discovery and the Crystal Palace still stood, how extraordinary it would seem now ever to sell them off. If some of the dome land is now sold well, the dome and its park can remain a public place, with no need to sell it, though it might be rented. The day will come - probably soon - when some Olympic or other sporting or cultural event will need the dome in a capital bereft of wonderful sites. The failure of Wembley Stadium plans is just another example of how badly Britain does great national monuments. But now we have a chance to get this right.  The last great dome crisis forced the Millennium Commission angrily to fork out a final £47m last October. But this sum was never actually drawn down. In its last three months, according to one millennium commissioner, increased numbers of visitors meant the dome broke even and never used those final funds that caused such volcanic public fury. The money is there, already given to the dome, and it should be used to help ensure the dome remains a public space. But the real endowment comes from the land around it, sold to create a trust for it in perpetuity.  Richard Rogers has an ambitious vision for the place and is likely to join better developers to propose a scheme for the North Greenwich peninsula that would be a model for the kind of regeneration his Urban Task Force advocates. It would include at least 40% affordable housing for the local community: he has been talking with Peabody and Rowntree about social housing possibilities. It would be a high density cityscape with shops and offices as well as homes, looking on to a leisure park around the dome that would be a national attraction for sports and concerts - run by PY or the BBC/Tussauds group, or any other entertainment consortium. He talks of things built in Barcelona and Amsterdam, and London's terrible past   mistakes. Last time I wrote about the dome, a fair number of emails from around the country complained bitterly at any more public time, money or attention being thrown at this London site. They have a point. It would have been better had the dome been built elsewhere. But there it is now in Greenwich, a national treasure on a site of natural beauty. Huge sums have been wasted, but that is no reason to waste the only good that can come from it.  Rogers points across the water to Canary Wharf, the great emblem of the Thatcher era - all offices, stylish restaurants and expensive houses, a pure property developers' hygienic, anodyne heaven straight from the brochure. It is an eerie place - no children, schools or old people, no workers, beggars, misfits, everything crisp and pricey for its cloned battalions of young professionals, with none of the eccentric, random oddity that breathes real   city life. Now imagine across the water a Labour era development in complete social contrast, a regeneration project as a model for other city schemes.  The question is: does this mark new thinking by Labour? In the early days, how avidly they sought to show they were as friendly to private developers as any conservative government. The tube is the next big question, as bargaining continues ferociously behind the scenes. Gordon Brown, jaw set, says the risk of major construction programmes must all be borne by private companies, despite passionate public opinion in favour of keeping it publicly owned. He ploughs on with the sale of air traffic control too, against the public will. But somewhere in the heart of government, the dome decision may herald the start of a welcome change of attitude for the second term."
1,"Walter Bagehot's edict that daylight should never shine on the magic of royalty is back in vogue. Not that much lustre attaches to an institution now darkened by a scandal of which we should not know. Officially, we have been told only that one subject of the rumour is Michael Fawcett, former toothpaste-squeezer to the Prince of Wales, and that the other is the prince himself. Maybe, by today, the full details of the mystery that dare not speak its name will have seeped from foreign newspapers into the British press. Disclosure was inevitable from the moment Mr Justice Tugendhat, a judge less in favour than some colleagues of Bagehotian news blackouts, ruled that Mr Fawcett could be named as the obtainer of a draconian gagging order.  Soon afterwards, Clarence House acknowledged Charles's involvement, issuing a vehement denial, though of what it could not say. The prince's men were gambling that this factual short-circuitry might appeal to people who long for a prelapsarian age of royalty and for butlers who, like Jeeves, shimmer about with trays of beverages rather than serving up necro-gossip from beyond Diana's grave. The courtiers were almost right.  The rumours do not sound compelling. Their source, another ex-toiler for the prince, is supposedly an alcoholic and a fantasist. Even readers who object to Charles using the media as a megaphone for his barmier causes recoil at how royal life has become Big Brother for the ermine set. Like any citizen, Charles is entitled to defend himself against being traduced. The usual means were at his disposal, and at Mr Fawcett's.  They could have let the story run and denounced it as poisonous fabrication. If that was not enough, a libel jury would have settled the matter. The first recourse might have sufficed, since the public does not enjoy crucifying the royals half as much as newspapers suppose. Nor are people stupid. They know that monarchs, from Aethelred the Redeless to Henry VIII, have behaved in ways that make today's royal family look like the Townswomen's Guild.  Last week's Channel 4 documentary on the Queen's uncle, the Duke of Kent, portrayed him as a hard-drinking, drug-using bisexual once chased by the police as he and his lover, Nol Coward, clattered down a London street in stilettoes. The Clarence House gossip, modest in comparison, is tabloid ectoplasm, swelled and shaped partly by the bungling of a household already suspected of furtiveness.  Considering how much practice they have had, the Windsors are hopeless at defusing scandal. Some months ago, entirely separate allegations of the cover-up of a homosexual rape by another palace servant and the sale of official gifts prompted Charles to launch an inquiry, conducted by his private secretary, Sir Michael Peat. Though cleared of financial impropriety, 'Fawcett the Fence' had to go. He left with generous severance pay, retained his £450,000 grace-and-favour home and earns a reported £100,000 a year for freelance services to Charles.  Mr Fawcett is again central to a furore, this time billed as the one that could break the monarchy. If that forecast is right, and it seems unlikely, then a British republic will spring not from grotesque rumour but from its heavy-handed suppression.  Royalty's evolving relationship with the law has often centred on canine matters. Queen Victoria sued to stop a publisher selling etchings of her dogs, and Princess Anne was fined for failing to prevent hers from biting a passer-by. On a less corgified note, Queen Anne refused royal assent to a 1707 Bill settling the militia in Scotland.   Three centuries on, the trials of two royal butlers collapsed after it emerged that the Queen, constitutionally the fount of justice, had known of Paul Burrell's stash of Diana's possessions but had not thought to mention it earlier. The resulting questions are so far unaddressed by the Law Lords. Although it seems probable that Her Majesty is competent to appear as a witness in a criminal case, the question of whether she is compellable is less sure. The Director of Public Prosecutions said last week that he could 'give no authoritative answer'.  Mr Fawcett was spared such legal vagueness. On learning that the Mail on Sunday was about to publish its bombshell, he speedily obtained from Mr Justice McKinnon an injunction that is hardly ever granted. How delighted the makers of Thalidomide, or the late Robert Maxwell, might have been if offered similar prior restraint.  To smash the precept that newspapers should publish and be damned would usher in the censorship of the police state. Yet when the Guardian proposed to name Mr Fawcett simply as the obtainer of this super-ban, Mr Justice Henriques handed out another gagging order over his mobile phone while stuck in traffic. The inescapable presumption of wig-doffing to royalty, unfortunate in the week when the Lord Chief Justice warned that the judiciary's sacred independence is under threat, has not even done Charles a favour.  First, he wants suppression, then pre-emptive denial. What, the courts may wonder, is his game? I doubt, having met him, that he really knows. To see him as dissolute or disreputable would be ludicrous. In many ways a rather tragic man, he affects despair that his worthwhile social policy work is overshadowed by carping. He cannot, or perhaps dare not, understand why he is so undermined.  The media tacitly decided, long ago, that Charles-baiting was the last legitimate national bloodsport. His faithlessness to the beloved Diana made him a target for high-minded moralisers of the popular media. That unfairness was made worse by the fact that the prince is unsuited, by behaviour and by temperament, to living under a tabloid fatwa. His combination of petulance and autocracy may have prompted the latest, panicked reaction.  Had he been wise, he would have faced down this rumour at the start. He could have gained public sympathy by pointing out how powerless even the privileged can be when newspapers discard human values and gossip is the wisdom of the age.  But even if the story were true, so what? Monarchists love the royals despite their venal ways, and republicans can think of worse failings than unprintable but legal indiscretions.  The Prince of Wales has shown, once again, that he simply does not get the dangers facing him, or understand the nation he hopes to lead. Britons are accommodating. They tolerate a kleptocratic monarchy that has never understood what treasures belong to it and which are ours. People have accepted, or revered in Diana's case, a princess who thinks she is Mother Teresa in Versace, an heir to the throne who thinks he is a Tampax and a mistress who thinks, maybe, she could one day be a queen.  The House of Windsor is almost scandal-proof. No flaky gossip-broker will directly bring it down. But the paying public does demand some openness. It does not want the fingerprints of a future head of state on the pillars of the constitution. If the Windsors, or their minions, give the impression that the law is at their personal disposal, Charles really might be staring at oblivion.  <BR>","The Daily Star's initial verdict on Charles and Camilla was too downbeat. 'Boring Old Gits to Wed' does not do justice to a legal maelstrom featuring a register office boycott by the Queen, who has allegedly also shelved plans for a banquet. Instead, the sporran polishers of the royal household will be rustling up bite-sized pork pies and warm Lambrusco. Some monarchists blame this 'shambles' on Tony Blair. In their view, his poor advice on wedding protocol betokens a contempt for royalty almost tantamount to back-door abolition. The Queen might certainly have expected a Prime Minister entitled to declare wars in her name to check, in return, whether a licence for Windsor Castle would entitle any old Kev and Bev to plight their troth beneath the Holbeins en route to Legoland.  Otherwise, the executive cannot be accused of negligence. Far from it. On whether the wedding will be lawful, the government has shown the same attention to detail that it applied to the war on Iraq. Both verdicts followed the celebrity chef school of jurisprudence, under which a brace of versions that someone prepared earlier is reheated with new finishing touches.  On the war, two old UN security council resolutions - 678 and 687- were conflated with a new one - 1,441 - to make the legal case. For the wedding, the Marriage Acts of 1836 and 1949, both appearing to preclude royal civil weddings, were laced with the Human Rights Act 1998, which affirms that adults may marry as they wish.  The difference is that Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, has publicly given his view that the marriage would be legal after others, including a former Tory   attorney general, said it might not. By contrast, the government still refuses to publish the current attorney's full advice on Iraq, despite mounting pressure.  But the point, beyond that discrepancy, is not whether the attack was legal (which it was not) or whether the marriage is lawful (a more mixed verdict). The issue is that the legal status of a bloody war has, over the past week, had less media coverage than the legitimacy of a marriage between middle-aged co-habitees.  This imbalance does not support the idea of an irrelevant or dying monarchy. Some royalists think Charles can never now be king; republicans say a clan so reviled by its fans must be tumbrel-fodder. But the Windsors are admirably performing one function of heads of state: that of defining who we are.  It is not a good picture, of Britain or of a family that makes  Shameless  look patrician. Charles's household, bedevilled by royal butler trials, employment tribunals and rape allegations, is presided over by a future king allegedly accused by his ex-wife of wanting to bump her off.  But the bystanders don't sound too pleasant, either. Father Paul Williamson of Feltham, Middlesex, who thinks it 'heresy and apostasy' to ordain women priests, intends to be at the ceremony and object out loud if his formal bids to halt proceedings are ignored. Other hecklers may turn up, egged on by frothing constitutionalists and commentators enjoying some down-and-dirty royal baiting. The Queen, in a reasonable decision, won't be there.  That is not to justify her handling of this mess. A monarch happy to sign a football and visit a drive-thru McDonald's should have welcomed the mix-up under which licensing Windsor Castle would have opened it to other people's weddings. Why not? The Windsors, who fleece visitors for inspecting treasures that belong to the nation, should not suddenly behave as if the paying public are scummy peasants likely to carve their initials in the perpendicular Gothic   or stick their gum on the van Dycks. In opting instead for a register office open to any befrocked pseudo-terrorist who wants to kiss Prince William, the royals might as well have issued gilt-edged invitations exactly to hoi polloi they wanted to exclude. They have also, inadvertently, created the sort of royal family Britain purports to want.  A bickering chavocracy that marries in register offices should suit advocates of a bicycling monarchy. But suddenly, a finger buffet, with all that subtext of pastel Crimplene and gift-wrapped toasters, strikes the media as too naff for words. Why no glass coaches and spit-roast Highgrove stag? Where is the self-respect of a country that may not be able to run a food standards agency but which defers to no one on choreographing a fairytale royal wedding? At the heart of the Windsors' survival is a snobbery that permeates society.  The current fuss has also conferred on them a new and powerful role. The real function of this monarchy is to be the lightning conductor for national loathing. Britain, in common with much of Europe, combusts too much hatred seeking a permissible outlet. In an age of fear, citizens are formally encouraged by government to accept people who represent otherness, such as immigrants and asylum seekers.  But those messages come laced with insidious hints of warning. From the terrorist suspect who cannot be charged to the exploited foreign worker and the disturbed child hauled before the courts, the country   is full of targets for a poisonous, if furtive, dislike. So how cathartic to have the royals, a conduit for collective cruelty and the only legitimate locus for upfront detestation. Obviously, this bloodsport is media-driven. Many Britons have no view on Charles's petulance or Camilla's cellulite and wish the royal story would go away, or at least switch from the personal to the institutional.  For the Windsors' sake, and ours, the government should act fast. As Lord Lester and others recommend, it should pass a brief bill formally sanctioning the legality of the marriage and so heading off inevitable challenges. Then Tony Blair should point out to Charles that the wedding got its initial figleaf of legality only because of a human rights act the prince once denounced as 'a threat to sane, civilised and ordered existence'. That legislation rules that royals must be treated like any ordinary citizen. In recognition, the prince should, like any ordinary citizen, pay his taxes, live within his means and be banned from sponging shamelessly off the state.  Short term, this democracy is stuck with the Windsors. The hereditary principle may be indefensible but, even at the current low point, only 23 per cent of respondents to a YouGov poll want the monarchy to die with the Queen. Until there is enough public enthusiasm for an elected head of state, reform and some kindness are better than a baying mob, in which sneering republicans stand shoulder to shoulder with hardcore evangelicals and Diana loyalists who think Camilla a Medusa in hunting pink.  Spite risks damaging Britain far more than our venal royals, who are never much dented by periodic fits of dislike. On the contrary, unpopularity may work to the advantage of an institution still capable of inspiring national unity, albeit of the ugliest kind. When, eventually, the monarchy perishes, its death certificate will cite as cause not public rage but the indifference of a grown-up country."

That is an Irish legend lost among the bogs and mists of futility. But, as the chimera called ""peace"" slips and slides again, it is at least worth going back to the beginning of these Troubles (more modern than ancient). What did the British government think then? We know, because the 30-year rule opens the closed cabinet doors of 1969. Home secretary James Callaghan told his colleagues that: ""There is a good deal of corroboration for the view that the Catholics have acted in self-defence, and little evidence to support the view of the Northern Irish government that the IRA are mainly responsible."" Big Jim's officials reported widespread unionist gerrymandering, favouritism and seedy control over local authority housing. ""There are legitimate grievances and it is entirely legitimate that they should be ventilated by demonstration.""  Callaghan himself told the new Northern Irish prime minister that ""he must not rely on British military support in maintaining repressive policies"". Harold Wilson's private secretary reported bleakly that ""our main trouble is from the Protestants"". Defence secretary Healey blamed the RUC for the ""indiscriminate use of firearms, tear gas etc"" and the head of the British army described a police force ""which is behind the times, poorly led and administered, with a sadly inefficient special branch.""   In sum, as it seemed to the men and women gathered around the long table in Downing Street, this was a no-win game which the unionists, the triumphalists of the Orange Order, had started by their mindless choice of sectarian repression over liberal democracy. And now, yet again, the poor old mainland Brits were being summoned to sort things out in blood, sweat and tears.  You don't need to agree in detail with those ministers and witnesses of 30 years ago to see the point. Agreement about anything in Northern Ireland's past is probably an unattainable golal. But the cabinet minutes do paint a grisly picture of frustration and helpessness. They tell us, as troubled times returned, where an impotent government far away laid the (mostly private, teeth-grinding) blame. British imperialism? Wilson's team, even then, wished Belfast could be deemed independent and told to push off.  For once, too, the recent past has relevance to the present. It reminds us, as the IRA hangs on to its guns and another ""process"" of reconciliation threatens to go belly up - perhaps for many years - that it takes two to make a peace. It reminds us that nothing can really begin afresh without continuing compromise, exercised day after day until it becomes normality.  A few weeks ago one truce ended. Eta, the zealots of Basque nationalism, returned to blowing up cars in crowded streets and killing people. And some thing else returned to Spain, the squares of Madrid and Pamplona. Crowds a million-strong walked arm in arm, expressing their disgust, horror and defiance. The Spanish people made their voices heard and, in so doing, immediately isolated the tiny straggle of terrorists. It won't end their campaign, to be sure: but it does create a political context which puts the greatest pressure on them. The people, massed, have that power.  I wonder, though, where the people of Northern Ireland have gone through these few glum weeks of slithering failure. I wonder (extrapolating) what the rest of the people of Britain think, if they care. For it is the people who have gone missing again, ruled themselves out of this eqation.   They were there once, with their candlelit vigils and their funeral marches as the killings echoed on. Many gallant individuals began movements then and still persevere. But where is the great shout of anger? Where are streets filled end to end with crowds who put peace first? Where is the pressure, the blessed pressure, for change?   Gerry Adams was talking the other day about ""the undefeated army"" of the IRA. It wasn't a popular line, one promptly rubbished by all the usual suspects. But it is also a clinically accurate description. The IRA was not defeated, any more than the British army and the RUC were defeated. Neither side was winning or losing: the struggle was just going on, for decade after decade, without point or possible outcome. If it is now renewed, as it may well eventually be, the years ahead will only be filled with more pointless violence. The IRA cannot win; but nor - as those who confront them admit under their breath - can the security forces. There is no easy fix of internment. There is no possibility of totally isolating the terrorists where a sectarian divide still yawns. No solution: just more of the same. You might as well say the Russian army has settled the Chechen problem by flattening Grozny. Dream on!  So where are the people in their own hour of need? There is no doubt how they feel or what they want, passively. They continue, for the most part, to vote along traditional lines. They haven't transplanted the old heart of Northern Irish politics.  They have accepted the reluctances of the Aremy Council with resignation and more depressingly, done little to disrupt activist distrust of the unionist Council which now, apparently, will circumscribe David Trimble's room for manoeuvre still more chokingly. They have, in sum, left hope to others they   decline to influence directly. Too harsh? Certainly in individual terms (see the tortured exhaustion of Seamus Mallon) but a collective judgment remains more problematical. If both Councils now feel the wind of outrage at their backs, then anything yet remains possible. But if there is no such manifest fury, then that in itself will deliver an awful truth.  Exit Mo, enter Mandy; exit, one day, Tony, enter who-can-say? The heirs of Wilson and Callaghan over the water will keep toiling on, biting their lips, hiding their real feelings because words out of place invoke inevitable furies. But peace, real peace, has to be craved for on the ground, sought as the highest prize. Peace isn't about symbols - a few machine guns or tons of Semtex given up in a hollow show of ""disarmament"" in Kosovo mode. New guns can always be bought, new obstacles found among the fudged clauses of diplomacy. Peace is determination to live together come what may. Peace isn't a minefield of ifs and buts - and sitting back while the vested interests carry on conniving. Peace has to be worked for.  A million Spaniards realise that. They walk for a purpose. It is a bleak thing to say, but there will be no lasting peace for Ireland until more millions throng the streets of Belfast and Dublin (and yes, Manchester and Birmingham too). This, 30 years on with nothing to show, is our challenge and our responsibility. And one day we shall have to acknowledge that by taking the prize for ourselves."

Where is the self-respect of a country that may not be able to run a food standards agency but which defers to no one on choreographing a fairytale royal wedding? At the heart of the Windsors' survival is a snobbery that permeates society.  The current fuss has also conferred on them a new and powerful role. The real function of this monarchy is to be the lightning conductor for national loathing. Britain, in common with much of Europe, combusts too much hatred seeking a permissible outlet. In an age of fear, citizens are formally encouraged by government to accept people who represent otherness, such as immigrants and asylum seekers.  But those messages come laced with insidious hints of warning. From the terrorist suspect who cannot be charged to the exploited foreign worker and the disturbed child hauled before the courts, the country   is full of targets for a poisonous, if furtive, dislike. So how cathartic to have the royals, a conduit for collective cruelty and the only legitimate locus for upfront detestation. Obviously, this bloodsport is media-driven. Many Britons have no view on Charles's petulance or Camilla's cellulite and wish the royal story would go away, or at least switch from the personal to the institutional.  For the Windsors' sake, and ours, the government should act fast. As Lord Lester and others recommend, it should pass a brief bill formally sanctioning the legality of the marriage and so heading off inevitable challenges. Then Tony Blair should point out to Charles that the wedding got its initial figleaf of legality only because of a human rights act the prince once denounced as 'a threat to sane, civilised and ordered existence'. That legislation rules that royals must be treated like any ordinary citizen. In recognition, the prince should, like any ordinary citizen, pay his taxes, live within his means and be banned from sponging shamelessly off the state.  Short term, this democracy is stuck with the Windsors. The hereditary principle may be indefensible but, even at the current low point, only 23 per cent of respondents to a YouGov poll want the monarchy to die with the Queen. Until there is enough public enthusiasm for an elected head of state, reform and some kindness are better than a baying mob, in which sneering republicans stand shoulder to shoulder with hardcore evangelicals and Diana loyalists who think Camilla a Medusa in hunting pink.  Spite risks damaging Britain far more than our venal royals, who are never much dented by periodic fits of dislike. On the contrary, unpopularity may work to the advantage of an institution still capable of inspiring national unity, albeit of the ugliest kind. When, eventually, the monarchy perishes, its death certificate will cite as cause not public rage but the indifference of a grown-up country.","The symbol of this Christmas is the noose. Hang my son, says Ian Huntley's mother. Hang Saddam, says almost everyone. The gallows is not an option for Maxine Carr, who is due out of jail next May. The relatively minor nature of her sin, a crime of lies and silence, has not prevented Maxine-haters placing her in a continuum of female she-devils stretching from Medea to Myra. As the great Judaeo-Christian feast approaches, the polarity between good and evil is stark. In modern replays of the Book of Genesis, conducted in settings as diverse as the Old Bailey, a spider hole near Tikrit and your local Odeon, light does not often vanquish darkness. For happy endings, try Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy at the National Theatre or Tolkien's Return of the King.  In real life, evil prevails. Despite George W. Bush's masterclasses on the subject, there is no particular hierarchy of monsterdom. Michael Jackson, facing child sex-abuse charges, may get a politer welcome on his planned visit to the UK than the one extended to the God-fearing President of the United States. Nor is there an obvious logic to the way we treat untouchables.  Saddam's capture inspired a desire for vengeance, certainly, but also an uneasy pity. The dead eyes and prophet's beard drove commentators to plunder the Old and New Testaments as thoroughly as Bush's speechwriters in an effort to discover what their unexpected sympathy represented. The non-religious answer is what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil.  Tyrants and murderers are defined not only by evidence of their actions - in Saddam's case, the toll of Kurdish citizens gassed and of skulls scratched up from mass graves - but by a cruelty of the imagination. Myths of how maniacal despots behave sit uneasily with Saddam's domestic inventory: one can of 7 Up, a bottle of Lacoste Pour Homme cologne, minted toothpicks, Maxwell House coffee and a picture inscribed 'God Bless Our Home'.  The humdrum detail that jars the observer out of unadulterated hatred also operated in the case of Ian Huntley. His conviction for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman was a restrained affair, free of mobs storming the courtroom precinct or screaming 'Kill Him', in an echo of Tyburn. There was little sign of the bloodlust that followed the Moors Murders and the sentencing of James Bulger's killers. Yet few murders have transfixed Britain, and the world, like those of Holly and Jessica.  Their deaths fed a fear corroding society. If two little girls in smalltown England could be lured to their deaths by a trusted neighbour, then no son or daughter is safe. But more than one child is slaughtered every week by a parent and no one notices. Skewed notions of risk are driven by rare crimes and normally articulated in mob venom.  One reason for a more subdued response might be the dignity of the Chapman and the Wells families, who forbore to demand vengeance. In addition, people do not know, and perhaps never will, exactly how the children died. But those facts do not explain why Huntley has escaped bestial status. I asked a hairdresser friend who has been canvassing her clients. 'It's because he looks so normal,' they told her.  Presentability served Huntley well. His convincing manner persuaded underage girls to have sex with him and prosecutors to ignore their cries of rape. The post-trial furore has been directed at police error in logging past complaints against him, but this is not primarily a scandal of bad filing. The lack of heed paid to his record reflects a society that extended more credence and legal rights to plausible men than to abused girls. Even now, if a case is to succeed, prosecutors prefer their victims dead.  The authorities and the public want child molesters to look like proper perverts, in the mould of a snaggle-toothed Roy Whiting, Sarah Payne's murderer, who appeared in the Sun last week under the headline 'Grinning Creature'. Resembling Jack Nicholson in the latter stages of The Shining saves confusion. Irrespective of bureaucratic bungling by police, Whiting was never school caretaker material. He is separate, a monstrous other who, unlike Huntley or Saddam, holds no Caliban's mirror up to the virtuous world. Pious people, along with neglectful officials and prurient newspapers, need not worry about the thin dividing line between the demon and the normal citizen.  Since the Soham trial lacked a monster from central casting, Maxine Carr gets the role. A fellow prisoner has thrown boiling water at her, and the media hold her guilty of murder by proxy. On the night of the killings, Carr was at a party. The outing might, her critics claim, have pushed a jealous Huntley over the brink. 'Kiss of death' screamed the headline over a picture of her embracing a fellow reveller.  That snapshot in a Grimsby disco placed Carr in a pantheon of female monsters, ranging from the Harpies and the Sirens of Greek legend to Rose West. In myth and in distorted reality, women, deadlier than the male, occupy a spectrum between psychopathy and culpability for engineering family breakdown and producing delinquent children. Carr, branded the 'new Myra' and the catalysing agent of evil, was actually a liar whose mistake was to shack up with a murderer.  In being duped by Huntley's charm, she resembled the police, the school staff, the community and the two trusting girls he murdered. She behaved as others might, and for that reminder of our fallibility, more than her mendacity, she can never be forgiven. In a universe where religious language and political discourse collide, Carr is banished forever from the civilised world to reside with the ranks of the dark forces. Their quarters are becoming more cramped than Saddam's bunker.  The expanding army of darkness encompasses murderers and their gullible girlfriends, along with leaders of Iran and North Korea, the shapeless prosecutors of terror and the suspects interned without charge at Guantanamo and Belmarsh. Arbitrary polarities of good and evil, patented by politicians, mesh with a vengefulness in public thinking.  The capital punishment debate stirs again. Huntley should be executed, according to the string-'em-up lobby whose ambitions will never be heeded by any mainstream political party. Hanging Saddam, however, is deemed perfectly acceptable in Downing Street and the impeccably liberal leader columns of the Independent.  Merciful democrats cannot have it both ways. Certainly, Saddam should be tried in Iraq, but for Britain to rubber-stamp a death sentence would be disgraceful buck-passing by an occupying power which must now stand by its principles. Either we support what David Blunkett calls 'judicial murder' or we recognise that the first test of a humane society is the way it treats the most hideous.  Saddam, like Huntley, should spend his life in prison. There they can suffer for their crimes while offering an enduring reminder to those who once armed a tyrant and failed to stop a potential murderer. Denouncing evil is easy. How much harder to recognise that monsters, with their French cologne and high street clothes, not only share our tastes. Good societies must also shoulder some fragment of their guilt."
0,"The Daily Star's initial verdict on Charles and Camilla was too downbeat. 'Boring Old Gits to Wed' does not do justice to a legal maelstrom featuring a register office boycott by the Queen, who has allegedly also shelved plans for a banquet. Instead, the sporran polishers of the royal household will be rustling up bite-sized pork pies and warm Lambrusco. Some monarchists blame this 'shambles' on Tony Blair. In their view, his poor advice on wedding protocol betokens a contempt for royalty almost tantamount to back-door abolition. The Queen might certainly have expected a Prime Minister entitled to declare wars in her name to check, in return, whether a licence for Windsor Castle would entitle any old Kev and Bev to plight their troth beneath the Holbeins en route to Legoland.  Otherwise, the executive cannot be accused of negligence. Far from it. On whether the wedding will be lawful, the government has shown the same attention to detail that it applied to the war on Iraq. Both verdicts followed the celebrity chef school of jurisprudence, under which a brace of versions that someone prepared earlier is reheated with new finishing touches.  On the war, two old UN security council resolutions - 678 and 687- were conflated with a new one - 1,441 - to make the legal case. For the wedding, the Marriage Acts of 1836 and 1949, both appearing to preclude royal civil weddings, were laced with the Human Rights Act 1998, which affirms that adults may marry as they wish.  The difference is that Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, has publicly given his view that the marriage would be legal after others, including a former Tory   attorney general, said it might not. By contrast, the government still refuses to publish the current attorney's full advice on Iraq, despite mounting pressure.  But the point, beyond that discrepancy, is not whether the attack was legal (which it was not) or whether the marriage is lawful (a more mixed verdict). The issue is that the legal status of a bloody war has, over the past week, had less media coverage than the legitimacy of a marriage between middle-aged co-habitees.  This imbalance does not support the idea of an irrelevant or dying monarchy. Some royalists think Charles can never now be king; republicans say a clan so reviled by its fans must be tumbrel-fodder. But the Windsors are admirably performing one function of heads of state: that of defining who we are.  It is not a good picture, of Britain or of a family that makes  Shameless  look patrician. Charles's household, bedevilled by royal butler trials, employment tribunals and rape allegations, is presided over by a future king allegedly accused by his ex-wife of wanting to bump her off.  But the bystanders don't sound too pleasant, either. Father Paul Williamson of Feltham, Middlesex, who thinks it 'heresy and apostasy' to ordain women priests, intends to be at the ceremony and object out loud if his formal bids to halt proceedings are ignored. Other hecklers may turn up, egged on by frothing constitutionalists and commentators enjoying some down-and-dirty royal baiting. The Queen, in a reasonable decision, won't be there.  That is not to justify her handling of this mess. A monarch happy to sign a football and visit a drive-thru McDonald's should have welcomed the mix-up under which licensing Windsor Castle would have opened it to other people's weddings. Why not? The Windsors, who fleece visitors for inspecting treasures that belong to the nation, should not suddenly behave as if the paying public are scummy peasants likely to carve their initials in the perpendicular Gothic   or stick their gum on the van Dycks. In opting instead for a register office open to any befrocked pseudo-terrorist who wants to kiss Prince William, the royals might as well have issued gilt-edged invitations exactly to hoi polloi they wanted to exclude. They have also, inadvertently, created the sort of royal family Britain purports to want.  A bickering chavocracy that marries in register offices should suit advocates of a bicycling monarchy. But suddenly, a finger buffet, with all that subtext of pastel Crimplene and gift-wrapped toasters, strikes the media as too naff for words. Why no glass coaches and spit-roast Highgrove stag? Where is the self-respect of a country that may not be able to run a food standards agency but which defers to no one on choreographing a fairytale royal wedding?

Britain stopped exporting contaminated cattle feed to Europe in 1991 (though we continued sending it to the third world until 1996). In most other EU countries cases have already peaked and declined, as expected. But in France, the number of infected animals has doubled in the last year. It is impossible to see how this pattern could result from the export of British bone meal. The simple fact is that the transmission of BSE has never been satisfactorily explained by the prevailing theory. The consumption of meat and bone meal from infected cows has doubtless had an important role to play. Yet this explanation alone fails to account for the huge numbers of cattle in Britain which continued to become infected after most contaminated feed had been removed from the food chain. The latest research on the human form of the disease, nvCJD, published three weeks ago, failed to find any link with the consumption of infected beef.  You might have imagined that when its theory isn't working, a government would wish to test the alternatives. But the British administration has, so far, sought only to attack a hypothesis which does appear to fit the facts. Since 1988, a Somerset farmer called Mark Purdey has been arguing that scientists have overlooked the root causes of BSE. Self-taught and self- financed, he has mastered the brain's complex biochemical pathways and this year published a groundbreaking paper in a respected medical journal. His reward is to have been reviled, misrepresented and physically attacked.  Prions, the brain proteins whose alteration seems to be responsible for BSE, are designed to protect the brain from the oxidising properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultra- violet light, Purdey argues. When, he suggests, the prion proteins are exposed to too little copper and too much manganese, the manganese takes the place of the copper the prion normally binds to. This means that the protein becomes distorted and loses its function.   BSE arose in British herds during the 1980s, Mark Purdey asserts, because the Ministry of Agriculture started forcing all cattle farmers to treat their animals with an organophosphate pesticide called phosmet, at far higher doses than are used elsewhere in the world. The pesticide had to be poured along the line of the spinal cord. Phosmet, Purdey has shown, captures copper. At the same time, cattle feed was being supplemented with chicken manure, from birds dosed with manganese to increase their egg yield. The prion proteins in the cows' brains were   both deprived of copper and dosed with manganese. In France, the use of phosmet first became mandatory in Brittany. Twenty of the country's initial 28 cases of BSE emerged there. BSE's subsequent spread, Purdey maintains, mirrors the use of the pesticide.  Poisoning by similar means may explain the distribution of the human form of the disease. Of the two main clusters in Britain one, in Kent, is in the middle of a fruit and hop growing area where huge quantities of both organophosphates and manganese-based fungicides are used. The other is in Queniborough in Leicestershire, whose dyeworks (until they caught fire a few years ago, spraying chemicals over the village) used to dump some of their residues into the sewage system, Purdey alleges. The sewage was spread over the fields. Dyeworks use shedloads of manganese.  Purdey has tested his theory on BSE and CJD clusters in Iceland, Colorado, Slovakia and Sardinia. He found that people and animals had been exposed to deficiencies of   copper and surfeits of manganese. Most of the clusters, intriguingly, are in mountainous areas, where levels of ultraviolet light are high. But the most compelling evidence in support of his hypothesis comes from a paper published by a team of biochemists at Cambridge this year. They found that when copper was substituted by manganese in prion proteins, the prions adopted precisely the distinguishing features which identify the infective agent in BSE.  If Purdey is right, he deserves a Nobel Prize for medicine. Instead he has been shot at, his phone lines have been cut and his house has been burnt down. The Ministry of Agriculture, which for 50 years has enjoyed a dangerously close relationship with the agrochemical industry, has repeatedly sought to discredit him. Suddenly, however, its tone has changed, and it has now promised to start funding his research. The families of the French victims of CJD are threatening to sue the British government, and it desperately needs an alternative transmission theory. With funding on its way, and new evidence accumulating every month, a self-educated Somerset dairy farmer could be about to overturn the entire body of scientific research on the biggest public health scandal of modern times."
1,"Today, and for many mornings to come, Linda Walker will be waking up in Styal prison, in Cheshire. There are better places to spend a Sunday. Six women killed themselves there in the space of a year and 41 tried to hang themselves over the last Mother's Day weekend. Mrs Walker, 48, is a teacher and head of year at a school for children with behavioural problems. She has a partner who is a college lecturer, twin sons of 17, a daughter and an elderly father for whom she cooks. Last week, she was jailed for six months after carrying out the sort of fantasy to which some liberals furtively confess. She showed the yobs what fear feels like.  In Mrs Walker's account, her house had been under siege. Bicycles were stolen, fish disappeared from the garden pond and wing mirrors were smashed. An abusive caller said her son was a 'poof' and asked: 'Does he want a good bumming?' On 14 August last year, Mrs Walker snapped when a container of liquid was poured over a family car  After haranguing a group of teenagers, she returned home to arm herself with a Walther CP88 gas-powered air pistol, which she had kept in her underwear drawer since a previous burglary, and an air rifle. Pausing only to phone the police to tell them that she was 'going to shoot the f****** vandals', she fired six times at the ground near an 18-year-old youth.  Exit Mrs Walker, her career almost certainly in ruins, complaining that the law supported 'yobbos and not victims'. The court heard later that she had acted in a moment of madness to defend her family. Anyone could write the script from this point onwards. As mainly right-wing newspapers clamoured for her freedom, Michael Howard made her the official martyr of his campaign to 'put fear into the heart of yobs'.  So far, so predictable, except that the Walker case, far from confirming entrenched opinions, confounds many of them. For a start, conservatives are correct to challenge her sentence. Prison is for those whose crimes are so grave or who are such a danger to the public that no other option is possible. Mrs Walker fulfils neither criterion, and, like thousands of other British women, she should not be there.  Harsh sentencing does not, though, excuse her behaviour or explain it. I have just been burgled and my neighbour had her basement stripped bare three days ago. Neither of us felt impelled to add a Terminator-style armoury to our underwear drawers. In her defence, Mrs Walker was reacting against something more insidious. Kierkegaard called anxiety 'the dizziness of freedom', but nothing makes people feel more unfree than being constantly under threat. And so Mrs Walker, a respectable teacher, staged a conversion almost as startling as if Miss Jean Brodie had become a Clockwork Orange droog.  Greater Manchester, where Mrs Walker lives, does not resemble Kubrick's urban nightmare. Indeed, the showcase for the government's anti-yob strategy should be getting safer by the day. No other police force has been so eager to hand out antisocial behaviour orders, making the patch the Home Office's model of good practice. In a six-month period last year, 155 people were Asboed, compared with 27 in Merseyside.  Mrs Walker's story, and her son's claim that she had vainly asked the police 15 times for help,   offers only an isolated example that all is not well in Asboland. But then the government, despite the focus on expanding its crackdown, hasn't been very scientific either. We know that a third of orders are breached and that two-thirds of those sentenced for failing to comply are sent to jail. There are worrying reports of children who are mentally ill or frail being criminalised. But six years and 4,000 orders after the policy's inception, there is not a single longitudinal study to show whether the orders stop bad behaviour or, as many experts on youth crime believe, make it worse.  That question matters more than pre-election chatter allows. The jailing of Linda Walker may be unjust, but it is much less alarming, in the story of badland Britain, than the spate of child offenders currently appearing at the Old Bailey. Last month alone, three schoolboys stood trial for murder there. One in 10 12-year-old boys and a quarter of 16- years-old boys have gone out armed in the last year.  Fear is for bigots and for politicians more adept at conjuring despair than dreams. Michael Howard talks up terror. The Archbishop of Canterbury knocks it down. Liberals, appalled by being asked to beware the gypsy, the asylum seeker, the immigrant and the kid outside the chip shop, think dread a disreputable emotion. But suddenly I am afraid.  My fear began when Hakeem Johnson, aged 13, walked into my local takeaway and stabbed a young manager to death because he would not serve him a £1 pizza after a special offer had ended. I am not personally frightened of Johnson's friends, whom I probably brush past often in the Holloway Road, but I am scared by the statistic that three-quarters of boys excluded from school, as he was, have used a weapon. I am disturbed that a teaching union   has reported a surge in classroom violence, and the government must be anxious, too, because the Schools Minister last week announced a knife amnesty to tackle the 'hugely disturbing' culture of weapons.  But most of all, I am alarmed that, despite the overall fall in crime, a new mood of casual cruelty is fermenting in cities where the problems, and solutions, are mostly arcane and intractable. Atrocious families and deprivation are nothing novel and the government has done some good things to tackle both; 100,000 children lifted out of poverty last year is not enough, but it is slow progress.  So why the knives and the gangs of teenagers practising the elastic-hipped swagger of the pretend assassin? Why the wave of rapes and murders combining adult savagery and the capricious pointlessness of childish rage?  I do not know and nor does the government. But I think, and so do charities working in the field, that a society driving wedges between adult authority and alienated youngsters can only ignite the problem of children who evolve so fast from victims to aggressors.  That is not to suggest that the mean streets of Greater Manchester and elsewhere can be sanitised by a combination of table tennis and a willingness by law-abiding citizens to have their lives made miserable in the interest of community relations. But neither is it right to beat the drum of punishment and exclusion while saying so little about positive intervention.  Linda Walker's jailing was not only extreme. It also helped reinforce the narrative, only patchily accurate, about a middle class terrorised by yobs. Politicians like that story. It strikes a chord with anyone who has had their windows smashed or their geography class made hell. It offers slick solutions to the genuinely persecuted. And it stops anyone asking whether today's tearaways are being officially groomed for tomorrow's knife gangs.","Walter Bagehot's edict that daylight should never shine on the magic of royalty is back in vogue. Not that much lustre attaches to an institution now darkened by a scandal of which we should not know. Officially, we have been told only that one subject of the rumour is Michael Fawcett, former toothpaste-squeezer to the Prince of Wales, and that the other is the prince himself. Maybe, by today, the full details of the mystery that dare not speak its name will have seeped from foreign newspapers into the British press. Disclosure was inevitable from the moment Mr Justice Tugendhat, a judge less in favour than some colleagues of Bagehotian news blackouts, ruled that Mr Fawcett could be named as the obtainer of a draconian gagging order.  Soon afterwards, Clarence House acknowledged Charles's involvement, issuing a vehement denial, though of what it could not say. The prince's men were gambling that this factual short-circuitry might appeal to people who long for a prelapsarian age of royalty and for butlers who, like Jeeves, shimmer about with trays of beverages rather than serving up necro-gossip from beyond Diana's grave. The courtiers were almost right.  The rumours do not sound compelling. Their source, another ex-toiler for the prince, is supposedly an alcoholic and a fantasist. Even readers who object to Charles using the media as a megaphone for his barmier causes recoil at how royal life has become Big Brother for the ermine set. Like any citizen, Charles is entitled to defend himself against being traduced. The usual means were at his disposal, and at Mr Fawcett's.  They could have let the story run and denounced it as poisonous fabrication. If that was not enough, a libel jury would have settled the matter. The first recourse might have sufficed, since the public does not enjoy crucifying the royals half as much as newspapers suppose. Nor are people stupid. They know that monarchs, from Aethelred the Redeless to Henry VIII, have behaved in ways that make today's royal family look like the Townswomen's Guild.  Last week's Channel 4 documentary on the Queen's uncle, the Duke of Kent, portrayed him as a hard-drinking, drug-using bisexual once chased by the police as he and his lover, Nol Coward, clattered down a London street in stilettoes. The Clarence House gossip, modest in comparison, is tabloid ectoplasm, swelled and shaped partly by the bungling of a household already suspected of furtiveness.  Considering how much practice they have had, the Windsors are hopeless at defusing scandal. Some months ago, entirely separate allegations of the cover-up of a homosexual rape by another palace servant and the sale of official gifts prompted Charles to launch an inquiry, conducted by his private secretary, Sir Michael Peat. Though cleared of financial impropriety, 'Fawcett the Fence' had to go. He left with generous severance pay, retained his £450,000 grace-and-favour home and earns a reported £100,000 a year for freelance services to Charles.  Mr Fawcett is again central to a furore, this time billed as the one that could break the monarchy. If that forecast is right, and it seems unlikely, then a British republic will spring not from grotesque rumour but from its heavy-handed suppression.  Royalty's evolving relationship with the law has often centred on canine matters. Queen Victoria sued to stop a publisher selling etchings of her dogs, and Princess Anne was fined for failing to prevent hers from biting a passer-by. On a less corgified note, Queen Anne refused royal assent to a 1707 Bill settling the militia in Scotland.   Three centuries on, the trials of two royal butlers collapsed after it emerged that the Queen, constitutionally the fount of justice, had known of Paul Burrell's stash of Diana's possessions but had not thought to mention it earlier. The resulting questions are so far unaddressed by the Law Lords. Although it seems probable that Her Majesty is competent to appear as a witness in a criminal case, the question of whether she is compellable is less sure. The Director of Public Prosecutions said last week that he could 'give no authoritative answer'.  Mr Fawcett was spared such legal vagueness. On learning that the Mail on Sunday was about to publish its bombshell, he speedily obtained from Mr Justice McKinnon an injunction that is hardly ever granted. How delighted the makers of Thalidomide, or the late Robert Maxwell, might have been if offered similar prior restraint.  To smash the precept that newspapers should publish and be damned would usher in the censorship of the police state. Yet when the Guardian proposed to name Mr Fawcett simply as the obtainer of this super-ban, Mr Justice Henriques handed out another gagging order over his mobile phone while stuck in traffic. The inescapable presumption of wig-doffing to royalty, unfortunate in the week when the Lord Chief Justice warned that the judiciary's sacred independence is under threat, has not even done Charles a favour.  First, he wants suppression, then pre-emptive denial. What, the courts may wonder, is his game? I doubt, having met him, that he really knows. To see him as dissolute or disreputable would be ludicrous. In many ways a rather tragic man, he affects despair that his worthwhile social policy work is overshadowed by carping. He cannot, or perhaps dare not, understand why he is so undermined.  The media tacitly decided, long ago, that Charles-baiting was the last legitimate national bloodsport. His faithlessness to the beloved Diana made him a target for high-minded moralisers of the popular media. That unfairness was made worse by the fact that the prince is unsuited, by behaviour and by temperament, to living under a tabloid fatwa. His combination of petulance and autocracy may have prompted the latest, panicked reaction.  Had he been wise, he would have faced down this rumour at the start. He could have gained public sympathy by pointing out how powerless even the privileged can be when newspapers discard human values and gossip is the wisdom of the age.  But even if the story were true, so what? Monarchists love the royals despite their venal ways, and republicans can think of worse failings than unprintable but legal indiscretions.  The Prince of Wales has shown, once again, that he simply does not get the dangers facing him, or understand the nation he hopes to lead. Britons are accommodating. They tolerate a kleptocratic monarchy that has never understood what treasures belong to it and which are ours. People have accepted, or revered in Diana's case, a princess who thinks she is Mother Teresa in Versace, an heir to the throne who thinks he is a Tampax and a mistress who thinks, maybe, she could one day be a queen.  The House of Windsor is almost scandal-proof. No flaky gossip-broker will directly bring it down. But the paying public does demand some openness. It does not want the fingerprints of a future head of state on the pillars of the constitution. If the Windsors, or their minions, give the impression that the law is at their personal disposal, Charles really might be staring at oblivion.  <BR>"

Six women killed themselves there in the space of a year and 41 tried to hang themselves over the last Mother's Day weekend. Mrs Walker, 48, is a teacher and head of year at a school for children with behavioural problems. She has a partner who is a college lecturer, twin sons of 17, a daughter and an elderly father for whom she cooks. Last week, she was jailed for six months after carrying out the sort of fantasy to which some liberals furtively confess. She showed the yobs what fear feels like.  In Mrs Walker's account, her house had been under siege. Bicycles were stolen, fish disappeared from the garden pond and wing mirrors were smashed. An abusive caller said her son was a 'poof' and asked: 'Does he want a good bumming?' On 14 August last year, Mrs Walker snapped when a container of liquid was poured over a family car  After haranguing a group of teenagers, she returned home to arm herself with a Walther CP88 gas-powered air pistol, which she had kept in her underwear drawer since a previous burglary, and an air rifle. Pausing only to phone the police to tell them that she was 'going to shoot the f****** vandals', she fired six times at the ground near an 18-year-old youth.  Exit Mrs Walker, her career almost certainly in ruins, complaining that the law supported 'yobbos and not victims'. The court heard later that she had acted in a moment of madness to defend her family. Anyone could write the script from this point onwards. As mainly right-wing newspapers clamoured for her freedom, Michael Howard made her the official martyr of his campaign to 'put fear into the heart of yobs'.  So far, so predictable, except that the Walker case, far from confirming entrenched opinions, confounds many of them. For a start, conservatives are correct to challenge her sentence. Prison is for those whose crimes are so grave or who are such a danger to the public that no other option is possible. Mrs Walker fulfils neither criterion, and, like thousands of other British women, she should not be there.  Harsh sentencing does not, though, excuse her behaviour or explain it. I have just been burgled and my neighbour had her basement stripped bare three days ago. Neither of us felt impelled to add a Terminator-style armoury to our underwear drawers. In her defence, Mrs Walker was reacting against something more insidious. Kierkegaard called anxiety 'the dizziness of freedom', but nothing makes people feel more unfree than being constantly under threat. And so Mrs Walker, a respectable teacher, staged a conversion almost as startling as if Miss Jean Brodie had become a Clockwork Orange droog.  Greater Manchester, where Mrs Walker lives, does not resemble Kubrick's urban nightmare. Indeed, the showcase for the government's anti-yob strategy should be getting safer by the day. No other police force has been so eager to hand out antisocial behaviour orders, making the patch the Home Office's model of good practice. In a six-month period last year, 155 people were Asboed, compared with 27 in Merseyside.  Mrs Walker's story, and her son's claim that she had vainly asked the police 15 times for help,   offers only an isolated example that all is not well in Asboland. But then the government, despite the focus on expanding its crackdown, hasn't been very scientific either. We know that a third of orders are breached and that two-thirds of those sentenced for failing to comply are sent to jail. There are worrying reports of children who are mentally ill or frail being criminalised. But six years and 4,000 orders after the policy's inception, there is not a single longitudinal study to show whether the orders stop bad behaviour or, as many experts on youth crime believe, make it worse.  That question matters more than pre-election chatter allows. The jailing of Linda Walker may be unjust, but it is much less alarming, in the story of badland Britain, than the spate of child offenders currently appearing at the Old Bailey. Last month alone, three schoolboys stood trial for murder there. One in 10 12-year-old boys and a quarter of 16- years-old boys have gone out armed in the last year.  Fear is for bigots and for politicians more adept at conjuring despair than dreams. Michael Howard talks up terror. The Archbishop of Canterbury knocks it down. Liberals, appalled by being asked to beware the gypsy, the asylum seeker, the immigrant and the kid outside the chip shop, think dread a disreputable emotion. But suddenly I am afraid.  My fear began when Hakeem Johnson, aged 13, walked into my local takeaway and stabbed a young manager to death because he would not serve him a £1 pizza after a special offer had ended. I am not personally frightened of Johnson's friends, whom I probably brush past often in the Holloway Road, but I am scared by the statistic that three-quarters of boys excluded from school, as he was, have used a weapon. I am disturbed that a teaching union   has reported a surge in classroom violence, and the government must be anxious, too, because the Schools Minister last week announced a knife amnesty to tackle the 'hugely disturbing' culture of weapons.  But most of all, I am alarmed that, despite the overall fall in crime, a new mood of casual cruelty is fermenting in cities where the problems, and solutions, are mostly arcane and intractable. Atrocious families and deprivation are nothing novel and the government has done some good things to tackle both; 100,000 children lifted out of poverty last year is not enough, but it is slow progress.  So why the knives and the gangs of teenagers practising the elastic-hipped swagger of the pretend assassin? Why the wave of rapes and murders combining adult savagery and the capricious pointlessness of childish rage?  I do not know and nor does the government. But I think, and so do charities working in the field, that a society driving wedges between adult authority and alienated youngsters can only ignite the problem of children who evolve so fast from victims to aggressors.  That is not to suggest that the mean streets of Greater Manchester and elsewhere can be sanitised by a combination of table tennis and a willingness by law-abiding citizens to have their lives made miserable in the interest of community relations. But neither is it right to beat the drum of punishment and exclusion while saying so little about positive intervention.  Linda Walker's jailing was not only extreme. It also helped reinforce the narrative, only patchily accurate, about a middle class terrorised by yobs. Politicians like that story. It strikes a chord with anyone who has had their windows smashed or their geography class made hell. It offers slick solutions to the genuinely persecuted. And it stops anyone asking whether today's tearaways are being officially groomed for tomorrow's knife gangs.","In further sensational, never previously broadcast interviews, Princess Diana describes events which will astonish the public and cast yet further doubts on her husband's fitness to rule. The recordings were made by her voice coach, Peter Pension-Scheme, whose teaching methods included immortalising the Princess on compromising video tapes, which were left with him for safe-keeping. In one tape, he is heard encouraging her to discuss her troubled marriage: ""You must have been desperate for a real, red-blooded man, given that your everyday life was a desperate vortex of disappointment, bulimia and unbearable sexual frustration."" ""Yeah,"" Diana says. Pension-Scheme: ""Your husband wasn't really meeting your needs?""  The Princess laughs. ""Twice a year, birthdays and Christmas - and that was cancelled if either of them fell on the 13th of the month. Typical Libra."" Pension-Scheme asks: ""So you were forced to seek intimacy elsewhere?"" ""And how,"" Diana says, rolling her eyes. ""Couldn't get enough - until we were found out. Then it was curtains."" Although she does not mention any names, it is understood that she is referring to John Major, the former Tory prime minister.  Pension-Scheme: ""He's said to be a very well endowed man."" Diana giggles again. ""Shall we say I thought he was just drop dead gorgeous. I don't find it easy to discuss - but I used to fantasise about running away from all this, finding a little bungalow somewhere, and spending the rest of my life taking care of him - but it wasn't meant to be.""   Diana's intimate friendship with Mr Major is understood to have continued until he was thrown out of office in 1997. Asked if she thinks his electoral defeat had anything to do with MI5, Diana lowers her voice. ""With a little help from You Know Who. I didn't know anything about it until Labour had been in for three weeks. Charles just came in and told me they'd won. By a landslide. Typical."" Minutes later she had to put on her public face and go shopping. ""I was devastated. Threw both of us down the stairs. Total and utter stitch up. But there was no way of proving it.""  The outgoing Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, has ordered an investigation into claims of voting irregularities in the 1997 election.  Before she was due to make an important speech, Mr Pension-Scheme would urge Diana to focus on the most hurtful aspects of life with her husband, then imagine herself performing a seductive victory dance with Wayne Sleep. She says she was devastated to discover, during her engagement, that Charles snored. ""Too late to change my mind. Completely shattering. He said he wasn't going to be the first Prince of Wales not to snore. Utterly typical.""  Pension-Scheme: ""Anything really disgusting? On a totally confidential basis, obviously."" Diana pauses. ""The worst thing - never told a soul, just too dangerous - is the devil worshipping thing. Right from the start of our marriage, I'd hear these terrifying howls at Highgrove. Spine chilling. Charles used to say it was owls."" Refusing to accept this explanation, a frightened Diana contacted one of her clairvoyants, Evelina Chequebook. ""Evelina came down and said the place was emitting more high-potency evil than anywhere she'd ever experienced. Totally toxic. Did my head in. Told me I absolutely had to get the boys out of there, before they were sucked into it. Can you believe it?""  Mr Pension-Scheme asks what happened. ""Went to see the Top Lady, as I call her,"" Diana says. ""Said, I happen know for a fact that Charles and Camilla and the Van Cutsems are devil-worshipping in the quinsy garden."" But the Queen refused to intervene.""Just said, 'Oh   Charles is utterly insane. Always has been. Always will be.' I said, 'Insanity! I see mental instability of such magnitude in my role that you would never understand.' And that was it. Nada.""  The outgoing Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, has ordered an investigation into claims that a satanic cult is operating from Highgrove.  In another sensational confession, Diana says she discovered the location of Lord Lucan. Invited by Peter Pension-Scheme to share any empowering but deeply private experiences which might extend her vocal range, the Princess reveals that she has the power to track down missing people and objects. ""People who have passed on, they tell me stuff. Tracked Charles down once, with his Lady. Behind his faith shed. Boy, were they surprised. And an earring. And Elvis came through once, saying Lucan's not really dead at all. Got me so upset.""  ""Where is he now?"" Pension-Scheme interjects. ""What's the exact address?""  ""He's living under a false identity in -"" here the Princess checks herself. ""I can't tell you. Too risky. And he begged me not to expose him. Knows what he did was wrong, but he's trying to rebuild his life. Absolutely begged. I said OK. Left it to fate. I know what goes around comes around."" Asked if she has told anyone else about her psychic powers, Diana tells Mr Pension-Scheme that he's the first. ""I know I can trust you.""  On the basis of new evidence, Sir John Stevens has ordered a re-investigation of Lord Lucan's disappearance. <B>Who is the 'melons' man? </B> <BR>  Even as one sympathises with the women MPs who, as a new report alleges, have endured unforgiveable insults from male colleagues, their reluctance to disclose which individuals offered them £10,000 for sex (reported by Oona King), or shouted ""melons"" (Barbara Follett), or ""literally"" pinned them to a wall by the neck (unnamed woman MP), or expressed a desire to ""roger"" a nearby woman (reported by Jackie Ballard), is quite mystifying. Who are these men? If they are still in parliament, should they not be named, and if guilty, subjected to public emasculation without anaesthetic? Or at any rate, invited to step down. Not only is it wrong to protect these primitives, the steady drone of unresolved complaint, if it persists for much longer, might give people the unfortunate impression that many women MPs are disproportionately preoccupied with their own specialness and personal grievances. One is still grumbling about the ""public school atmosphere"". Yet another says she ""dreads"" PM's questions. Can nothing be done to help them? Some effective collective action might liberate female MPs and civilise rogue males, at the same time as encouraging women who regularly face worse treatment, in far harder circumstances, all over the country.  Unless one explanation for this apparent passivity is that many of the more lurid offences reported this week actually occurred years ago, long before the breast-feeding reforms and the changes in Commons hours and culture which now make the woman MP's lot the envy of many full-time workers with four weeks annual holiday. Although, as Dawn Primarolo suggested, it can still be difficult for women MPs to escape from work in order to watch their children play in rugby or football matches. I wonder if they have considered doing so during important parliamentary debates.   A debate, for example, like the one about David Blunkett's outrageous and ignorant proposal to restrict freedom of speech where it relates to religion. You couldn't help but notice, on Tuesday afternoon, that this long, non-boorish discussion did not feature a single contribution from a woman backbencher. Two female junior ministers spoke in defence of censorship. Perhaps there were some important matches on.    <B>Ridicule us too, please </B><BR>  Jackie Rowley, communications director for Charles Kennedy, emails to ask why the Lib Dem    leader's card did not feature in a piece, published earlier this week, about politicians' Christmas cards. ""Did you fail to mention the Kennedy card because it was too normal (and in aid of a constituency charity)?"" she asks. I see that lack of space is no excuse for ignoring Mr Kennedy's almost unimproveable Christmas card (in aid of the Highland Hospice in Inverness), which depicts a croft in the foreground and, behind it, the sunlit eminence of Glencoe, partially obscured by a line of horizontal cloud. I am conscious that there may be other cards which ought to be described in the Guardian. If so, do let me know."
