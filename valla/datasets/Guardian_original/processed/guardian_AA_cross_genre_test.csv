2,"ï»¿We have Lord Hutton, the Americans have Bob Woodward. Both get the people who count to talk. While his lordship used the power of judicial summons, Woodward offers a deal. If you talk, he will faithfully present your side of the story. If you do not, your rivals will - and they'll end up looking good, often at your expense. That threat has persuaded Washington power brokers to cooperate on a series of bestselling Woodward books - and now it has worked its magic again to produce Plan of Attack, the inside story of the war against Iraq. Thanks to interviews with 75 key players, including on-the-record sessions with President Bush, as well as access to memos, transcripts of phone calls on secure lines (including those to Tony Blair), even Power Point presentations from military computers, this book is packed with the kind of high-grade information that traditionally stays hidden until the publication of memoirs years after the event. Here is the inside track on a crisis that is barely a year old and still unfolding. Woodward's style is not to present an overall analysis, still less a polemic, but simply to lay out the facts and viewpoints of the main actors. He rarely joins the dots, as those in the Bush administration might say. But it hardly matters: the dots themselves are compelling enough. What emerges is not only a fast-moving narrative of the build-up to war, but also a valuable resource - whatever your stance. If you reckon Bush is an intellectual featherweight barely up to the job, there is ammunition here - such as the January 2001 briefing at the Pentagon when the new president, not yet sworn in, struggles to pay attention to his generals: he is too distracted by the little peppermint at each place around the table. He gobbles up his own, then eyes those of the outgoing defence secretary and chief of staff until he has scoffed theirs too. On the other hand, there is rather more evidence leaning the other way - of a man fully in control. Those who believe Dick Cheney is the ventriloquist and Bush the dummy will be disappointed to read how hard Cheney pushed for the UN to be bypassed - and how Bush overruled him and went to the UN anyway (under pressure from Colin Powell and Blair). Indeed, the Bush that emerges on these pages is strikingly aware of his own role and status, constantly referring to himself by his title and emphasising the final power of his own decision. His closest aides seem intoxicated by that, too, as if playing out all the Oval Office movies they have ever seen: the grandeur of the office is almost sacral, to the extent that it can overwhelm them and cloud their judgment. Thus we learn not only that Bush never asked Powell whether he thought it was right to go to war with Iraq, but also that Powell never offered his opinion. ""He would not intrude on that most private of presidential spaces - where a president made decisions of war and peace - unless he was invited."" Even if he had, it's not likely he would have made much difference. For the theme that emerges most powerfully from this book is that this war was all but pre-ordained. Even before Bush was inaugurated, Cheney decided that ""topic A"" of the new president's first national security briefing should be Iraq. On Day 17 of the new administration, the ""principals"" met to discuss ... Iraq. The ""axis of evil"", we discover, was always about Iraq: North Korea and Iran were padding to make it look less obvious. When General Tommy Franks was charged with preparing a war plan, he was told that money was no object: he could spend whatever millions he wanted. Crucially, any countervailing evidence was ignored. Defectors told the CIA that the Iraqi military was so ragged that ""Iraqi pilots were inventing illnesses on the days they were supposed to fly because they were terrified [their] inadequately maintained planes would crash"". Yet Bush continued to tell the world that Saddam posed a military threat to the United States. In September 2002, during a meeting about possible targets, Franks gave it to Bush straight: ""Mr President, we've been looking for Scud missiles and other weapons of mass destruction for 10 years and haven't found any yet."" On every page comes evidence that Washington's mind was made up. No wonder Powell was ""in the fridge,"" cold-shouldered by the inner circle. The rest of them were set on this course early, Bush taking Donald Rumsfeld aside and asking him to work on an Iraq war plan as early as November 2001. Powell is surely right to tell Woodward that Cheney was ""terrified"" of the UN route - lest it actually work and prevent war. This large theme carries others with it. One is the role of Tony Blair. Apart from reinforcing Powell on the UN, Woodward's account shows him to have secured little - save a delay here and there to help him win his vote in parliament. Woodward's picture of Blair is not flattering (next time he should make sure he's interviewed). In September 2002 he vowed to Bush that ""I'm with you"", pledging British military help even as he was telling close colleagues that no decisions had yet been taken. Publicly Blair insisted he was so passionate about ousting Saddam that he would have pushed for it even if Bush was not keen; yet Woodward quotes a Blair adviser admitting that of the three ""axis"" powers, the PM regarded Iran and North Korea as the greater threats. Most damaging of all - and a revelation that would surely have helped Lord Hutton in his inquiries - we discover that the head of the CIA regarded the notorious 45-minute claim as ""shit"" and had warned the British to that effect. Yet Downing Street went ahead and put the claim in the September dossier. In Woodward's account, the true special relationship is not with Britain but with Saudi Arabia. The kingdom's ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar, is in and out of the Oval Office, granted extraordinary and constant access. Tellingly, he is the only person in the entire volume who talks back to Bush, interrupting him and even taunting him. That Bush takes it, and that Bandar is formally notified of the start of the war before Powell (or Blair), will have many wondering what exactly is the nature of the Saudi hold on the Bush administration. Woodward offers a tantalising clue: ""The Saudis hoped to fine-tune oil prices ... to prime the economy for 2004. What was key, Bandar knew, were the economic conditions before a presidential election, not at the moment of the election."" In other words, the Saudis were favoured because they were going to rig the global economy to ensure Bush a second term. Woodward's book has some heroes, too, in the form of the handful of Democratic senators who saw through the guff about WMD early. It has some splashes of colour, including the derring-do of a CIA team handing out wads of $100 bills in northern Iraq, and plenty to confirm that the Washington power bubble is one of the most dysfunctional places on earth. Bush goes to bed at 8.45pm; General Franks is at work by 3am; everyone phones every one else at 6am and Colin Powell takes a call from the French foreign minister to discuss the wording of a UN resolution 20 minutes before he is due to walk his daughter down the aisle. It all adds up to a volume as gripping as a bumper episode of The West Wing, with the added advantage that it's all true. Make that a disadvantage: for this book also confirms our worst fears, that the world's hyperpower is in the hands of a dangerous gang - and our own PM is with them every step of the way."
5,"You can never predict which writers will survive, but tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of readers believe that Stieg Larsson's Millennium series places him in that small group of thriller writers whose books future generations will enjoy long after many ""serious"" producers of literary fiction have been forgotten. An unsympathetic critic might look at The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, the final volume of the 2,100-page trilogy, and wonder why. Unlike Raymond Chandler or John le Carr, Larsson cannot take you to another place with a few strokes of the pen. The novel opens with Lisbeth Salander lying in a remote homestead with a bullet in her head. She has just taken an axe to her father, Alexander Zalachenko, a KGB defector whose sex trafficking business is protected by a corrupt sect in the Swedish intelligence service. She was provoked: Zalachenko had tried to bury her alive. Somewhere in the woods, the hero, Mikael Blomkvist, has confronted Zalachenko's hit man, a giant with a taste for snapping necks. Yet Larsson cannot conjure up a menacing atmosphere in a remote Scandinavian forest and does not try. The action takes places in a ""white farmhouse somewhere near Nossebro"", he says, and leaves it at that. The rest of the book is set in the police stations and newspaper offices of Stockholm, as the secret police try to protect themselves by rigging the trial of Salander, who was badly injured but not killed by the bullet. For all the local detail Larsson offers, a foreigner cannot get a sense of the city from reading the Millennium trilogy, whereas people who have never been to Edinburgh feel they know it from reading Ian Rankin. Salander herself is a magnificent creation: a feminist avenging angel. But elsewhere Larsson's characterisation is perfunctory. All the decent journalists, police officers and secret servicemen who help Blomkvist bust open the conspiracy are essentially the same: good Swedish social democrats, sexually liberated and tolerant of everything except the abuse of human rights. Quite rightly, Larsson's admirers do not care. His phenomenal, if sadly posthumous, success comes from a combination of moral clarity and narrative skill rather than descriptive ability. In the second volume, The Girl Who Played With Fire, he announces his creed when he has a reporter tell Blomkvist he wants to go after the men shipping Russian girls into Sweden: ""Blomkvist smiled. He had never met Svensson before, but he felt at once that he was the kind of journalist he liked, someone who got right to the heart of the story. For Blomkvist the golden rule in journalism  was that there were always people who were responsible. The bad guys."" As a left-wing reporter who had investigated neo-Nazi gangs, and lived in fear of murderous reprisals, Larsson had learned to mistrust non-judgmental pieties about there being ""good and bad in all of us"". Hard-won experience taught him to avoid the shades of grey, which reduce so much contemporary fiction  and political thought  to a formless blur. Specifically, Larsson believed misogyny to be an unpardonable evil, and wove a feminist argument through the trilogy with enormous skill. All thriller plots are ludicrous when you to stop to think about them, but Larsson uses male hatred of women to make his uncomfortably plausible. Without giving too much about the final volume away, it turns on a secret police plot to keep Salander quiet by duping a pompous prosecutor into seeking a court order to confine her to an asylum. The prosecutor isn't part of the conspiracy. But he has already confidently if falsely accused her of three murders and fed the press with stories that she was a member of a satanic lesbian cult. He does not repent his mistake but turns on his victim: ""Everything had gone haywire, and he had found himself with a completely different murderer and a chaos that seemed to have no end in sight. That bitch Salander."" When the crooked psychiatrist who had tried to drive the young Salander mad by keeping her tied to a hospital bed prepares to take her back under his control, he gloats that he ""had not become an internationally respected psychiatrist for nothing. He could  sense a cold shadow passing through the room, and interpreted this as a sign that the patient felt fear and shame beneath her imperturbable exterior. He was pleased that her attitude to him had not changed over the years. She's going to hang herself in the district court."" I cannot think of another modern writer who so successfully turns his politics away from a preachy manifesto and into a dynamic narrative device. Larsson's hatred of injustice will drive readers across the world through a three-volume novel and leave them regretting reaching the final page; and regretting, even more, the early death of a master storyteller just as he was entering his prime."
5,"The Author of Himself: The Life of Marcel Reich-Ranicki<br />Marcel Reich-Ranicki<br />Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson £25, pp405<br />Buy it at a 
discount at BOL To imagine a British Marcel Reich-Ranicki, you would have to pretend that Melvyn Bragg was an Irish Catholic whose family was murdered in cold blood by the British Army; that he was interned in Long Kesh, escaped and spied for the Soviet Union; that he defected to London after becoming a victim of the late Stalin purges and became the most influential literary critic in Britain, revered by housewives as much as professors for work of the seriousness of  In Our Time rather than  The South Bank Show.  The exercise is futile. A British Reich-Ranicki is an impossibility. He is a German phenomenon, who is not German.   Reich-Ranicki is the son of Polish Jews. He was born in 1920. His father was a hopeless businessman. 'If he had manufactured coffins,' said his wife, 'people would have stopped dying.' His mother's faith in the values of German culture was deep. When looting troops stole her wedding ring after the Nazi invasion of Poland, she was convinced that the outrage against good order would be rectified if she lodged an official complaint with the  Kommandatur. The family emigrated to Berlin after the Wall Street Crash and Reich-Ranicki proved he was his mother's son. He loses his virginity, finds love at first    sight in the Warsaw Ghetto, suffers persecution and sees his ambitions triumph with a chorus of German writers pounding out quotations in his mind. He says he is  The Author of Himself  because of his refusal to be classified by nationality or religion. But every page reveals how, contrary to postmodern theory, great authors can shape their readers.   His account of his Berlin schooldays and their aftermath are among the most touching sequences. Despite the incitements of the Hitler regime, his classmates and teachers treated him   with propriety; the abhorrence of vulgarity of the Prussian bourgeoisie prevented Jew-baiting. After the war, he attended a class reunion. Everyone was as polite as before. 'No one wanted to hear the details' of his torments in the Warsaw Ghetto. Good manners also meant knowing when to forget about unpleasantness.   None of the novelists he got to know after he returned to Germany in the Fifties asked about the extermination of Jewry. The first German to cross-examine him was a young, intense journalist he met in 1964 and rather liked - Ulrike Meinhof.   The publishers puff these memoirs as an 'unforgettable piece of Holocaust literature' and undoubtedly his descriptions of seeing his mother and father taken off to be murdered are devastating. I find the idea of a genre of 'Holocaust literature' as faintly exploitative   and false as heroin chic and was relieved to learn that Reich-Ranicki achieved a small victory over Hitler - he did not allow the Holocaust to dominate the rest of his life.   Reich-Ranicki and his wife escaped the Ghetto. He was hidden by a Polish working-class family. The Red Army swept the Germans out. He joined the Polish communists as an interpreter and then ran agents spying on free Poles in Britain from the London embassy. He was purged. He escaped to West Germany and, with remarkable speed, established himself as the pre-eminent   critic and interpreter of German literature on every available medium.   When his work as a Stalinist spy in the late Forties was revealed, by the son of his best friend, it caused a scandal. Reich-Ranicki shows few regrets. The doubts of his old age - he is 80 - are those of a critic worried about meretricious posturing and causing pain. How could he, as a young, rather ignorant music critic on the Warsaw Ghetto newspaper, 'hurt this or that musician' weeks before they were to be taken to the gas chamber? Why, when he could see Ingeborg Bachmann was dying, didn't he tell her her poems 'were among the most beautiful written in the German language this century?'   On his own account, many authors cannot stand him. He complains repeatedly of writers' egotism - all they want is praise and to talk about themselves - while showing very little   understanding of the egotism of the critic. He is perplexed when friends are infuriated by bad reviews. In 50 years of reviewing, he has not learned that you can be a good friend or you can be an honest critic, but you cannot be both.   The affection of readers is not in doubt. His autobiography has been top of the German bestsellers' list for more than a year. A Jew who voluntarily returned to Germany and upheld the republic's liberal values was probably always going to be celebrated. But, I think, his popularity owes much to an uncondescendingly serious tone. Reich-Ranicki's writing is accessible, but he does not indulge in insulting explanation of the 'William Shakespeare, the famous playwright from Stratford in Warwickshire' style that increasingly dominates British media. He assumes you understand his references. If you don't, you are flattered and inspired to look them up.   Not the smallest of reasons for buying his autobiography is that his extraordinary life and generous rigour could not happen here."
5,"Three Victories and a Defeat<br />by Brendan Simms<br />Allen Lane, £30, pp800 British Eurosceptics live with a paradox as close to tragedy as anything can be in high politics. A determination to disentangle Britain from Europe drives them into public life. To their delight they find the overwhelming majority of public opinion agrees with them. Passion, flair and the best democratic arguments are on the Eurosceptic side. Yet parties that oppose Europe always lose elections. However much they agree with them, voters sense a danger and turn away. Bennite isolationism wrecked Labour in the Eighties. Harder to explain is the failure of the modern Tories. In an age of globalisation, their policy of putting clear blue water between Britain and Europe and looking across the oceans to the trading stations of the old empire sounds practical, but a sympathetic public can never be persuaded to vote in large enough numbers to implement it. Brendan Simms is too good a historian to exploit the past to score a point about the present. Rather, Three Victories and a Defeat is an argument about the constants of foreign policy; about how in the 18th century the knowledge that Britain wasn't 'an island entire of itself' made it a superpower, and how the American colonies were lost when the British tried to manage on their own. Like everyone else who tosses the quotation around, I'd assumed John Donne was talking about the human condition not the balance of power. But, as Simms points out on his first page, Donne was writing when James I had outraged respectable opinion by failing to help European Protestants. 'No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod is washed away by the sea, Europe is the less...' was written at a time of fear that Catholic Spain would overwhelm the Low Countries and seize the ports it needed for an invasion. From 1688 through to 1763 statesmen sought to prevent a 'universal monarchy', whether Hapsburg or Bourbon, dominating the continent and thus threatening Britain. With great skill and a light touch, Simms tells the complicated story of how a country that under Charles II and James II was little more than a French satellite searched for security by becoming involved in the politics of every country from the Ottoman Empire to Sweden, built alliances, switched sides, paid bribes, sent off armies and developed the navy. As now, resentment at involvement in Europe was always present. Patriotic and often xenophobic opinion loathed the Whig oligarchs for their willingness to spend blood and treasure on the wars of the Dutch William and German Hanoverians. In 1711, Swift asked in his great polemic, The Conduct of the Allies, why the English should support the cause of the hated Dutch, fight their battles and pick up their bills? Why bother when the only part of England to benefit was the City - 'that set of people who are called the moneyed men... whose perpetual harvest is war, and whose beneficial way of traffic must very much decline by a peace'? To my mind Simms doesn't acknowledge the force of Swift's questions or the Tory and radical criticisms of the wars and corruption of the Whigs. But then I suppose he feels he doesn't have to, because after winning the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, Britain turned her back on Europe as the Tories had always wanted and the result was catastrophe. Simms, a Peterhouse don, has become the most formidable modern enemy of the Conservative tradition in foreign policy. His last book, Unfinest Hour, so excoriated the Major government's behaviour during the Bosnian crisis that I know people who have refused to shake the hand of Douglas Hurd or Malcolm Rifkind after reading it. Three Victories and a Defeat does the same to their predecessors. The Tories assumed that Britain could forget about Europe and hide behind the Royal Navy. But because the British stopped diverting France and Spain with alliances in Europe, their enemies could build up their navies and combine to challenge Britain when the American War of Independence began. Simms is refreshingly unsentimental about the revolution, seeing it, quite rightly, as a clash of imperialisms. Benjamin Franklin and many others had been empire loyalists. When they realised that the Tory policy of avoiding conflict would stop the 13 colonies expanding across the continent, they revolted. Britain was never as alone as it was in the American War of Independence. Even in 1940, Greece was still an ally. In 1776, there was no one. Prescient men of the day realised the scale of the rout. Horace Walpole predicted that one day Europeans would take instructions from Americans, while the American delegation in Paris told the French that a great empire would emerge from the scattered settlements on the Atlantic seaboard, 'and they will all speak English, every one of 'em'. This book is a strong riposte to Linda Colley's argument that the British defined themselves against the European 'other'. Not so, Simms replies, 'Britain's fate' is decided in Europe 'always has been and always would be'. History doesn't repeat itself, but geography doesn't change. We do not live on 'an island entire of itself' but in a European country. Unless Eurosceptics can find continental allies against Brussels, they are as certain to fail as their ancestors."
8,"Cold Cream: My Early Life and Other Mistakes by Ferdinand Mount 384pp, Bloomsbury, &pound;20 Long ago, when Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister, I was often distracted from even her strident performances in the House of Commons by a sight which illustrated the complicated social structure of England. Two men sat side by side in the front row of the press gallery, possessed of equally scarlet faces. But Bernard Ingham (the Downing Street press secretary) radiated the brick-red complexion of the northern working classes, while Ferdinand Mount (the head of the policy unit) glowed with the hunting-pink patina of a country gentleman. I now discover that Mount was brought up among a particular branch of the rural gentry - louche, point-to-point competitors who never worked for a living but ""had a good war"". Mount, plagiarising Lorenz Hart, calls them the ""hobohemia"". They are not the sort of people it would be a pleasure to meet. But Mount makes reading about them pure joy. It will be the story of Mount's life as acolyte to Margaret Thatcher - about a third of the book - which attracts most attention, and he provides such a vivid picture of life under her thumb that he may have made an important contribution to the history of her premiership. But what sets his account apart from other ""insider"" descriptions of the long-running drama is not the portrait of the star - simultaneously affectionate, critical, admiring and exasperated - but the sketches of the full supporting cast. The rightwing ideologist Alfred Sherman - ""his reputation as Svengali to Margaret's Trilby already in place"" - is awarded a page and a half of biography, including a mention of his service as ""consultant to Radovan Karadzic of Serbia, an indicted war criminal"". Then his character and role within the Conservative party is summed up in a single sentence: ""The whole point of Alfred was that he was horrible and licensed to be horrible."" Admiration of the style almost makes the reader forget that it was Sherman who - with the approval of Ferdinand Mount - argued that, whatever the merits of their cause, ""the miners had to be beaten"". Mount progressed, almost absent-mindedly, into politics via journalism. At the Daily Mail he seems to have been accepted at once - as an Old Etonian would expect - into the inner circle. So he can describe, with authority, weekends at the Rothermere country house watching films - ""more likely to be The Yellow Rolls-Royce than Last Year in Marienbad"". Therein lies the one real weakness of Cold Cream. Mount patronises the people about whom he writes without detaching himself from the life and values which he so succesfully satirises. His invention of the ""upper class chat"" in the front row of the Rothermere cinema - ""Sheemie says he's not speaking to Boofy after what happened at Chatsworth"" - is different in style, but not in spirit from some of the passages in the text which the reader is supposed to take seriously. ""Diana, as befitted her name, was a superb steeplechase rider and dedicated to foxhunting as to any dangerous sport that came her way."" It is not always easy to tell when the faint echoes of Evelyn Waugh and PG Wodehouse are intentional and when they are a reflection of Mount's character. But either way, they are great fun. Some readers will be irritated by the succession of famous and once-fashionable names that litter Cold Cream's early pages - Malcolm Muggeridge, Anthony Powell, Guy Burgess, Isaiah Berlin, Anthony Blunt, Barbara Pym, the Pakenhams, to whom he is related, and Lady Pamela Berry. Writing about them comes absolutely naturally to Mount and adds to the book's slightly antediluvian charm. They were part of his boyhood and adolescence in the way that Councillor George Buttery and Alderman Albert Ballard were part of mine. It is a matter for neither praise nor blame. But the way in which he writes about them - often in a manner they would find disobliging - is unequivocally a cause for congratulation. The class warrior in me raises the suspicion that Cold Cream is a triumph of style over content. Apart, that is, from the chapters devoted to assorted Tory grandees and functionaries. I am not usually attracted by tittle-tattle about the private lives of the famous. But occasionally it reveals something important about their characters. Mount tells us that while working for the Conservative Research Department - and courting the secretary who became his wife - Enoch Powell could only bring himself to embrace her when they were both inside a stationery cupboard. I find great consolation in the confirmation that Powell - as well as holding detestable views - was slightly barmy. Mount's judgment of Powell's mentality - as revealed by the cupboard episode - is barely more charitable than mine. He attributes the pantomime to ""Enoch's taste for melodrama, his determination to inject drama into the commonplace"". To my astonishment, Mount actually makes me feel sorry for Selwyn Lloyd. In the account of his last years in party politics, the Suez errand boy is a desperately sad figure, neither at ease with himself nor with the political world he chose to inhabit. Even Keith Joseph, the All Souls' intellectual who laid claim to inventing Thatcherism, is portrayed as uncertain. Mount, on the other hand, exudes the pleasure he feels at being Mount. Joseph and poor Selwyn apart, Cold Cream is a book about people with immense self-confidence - some justifying it, some not. It contains wonderful vignettes and the writing makes the inconsequential stories worth reading. But I shall cherish it for more than its elegance. If I ever need to be reminded that the class war still rages - and which side I am on - I shall read Cold Cream again."
8,"A Very British Strike  by Anne Perkins 356pp, Macmillan, &pound;20 Challenge to Democracy<br/> by Ronald McIntosh 400pp, Politico's, &pound;25 Miners and those who support their causes have always had long, but selective, memories. It has helped to create the esprit de corps which, combined with a courage that their trade demanded, made them fight on long after their industrial battles had been lost. In A Very British Strike, Anne Perkins writes of Black Friday, April 15 1921. On that day, the leaders of the transport and rail unions refused to strike in support of their allies, the miners. This ""was branded on the souls of all good trade unionists as the moment when the timid leadership sacrificed the miners"". In my experience the resentment was more specific. When, in 1950, I canvassed in a general election for the first time, one of my companions was Les Higgins, a railway guard. When I got home the account of my activities was interrupted by my mother, as soon as Higgins was mentioned. ""The railwaymen deserted us in 1921."" Black Friday was redeemed. On May 1 1925, the miners - having swallowed their pride and allowed the TUC to join in the negotiations - won a spectacular victory. Within days of the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, announcing that ""all workers ... have to take reductions in wages to help put industry on its feet"", he capitulated with the announcement that the government would pay the difference between the owners' offer and the miners' demands until the commission of inquiry into the industry reported. The union celebrated Red Friday in the belief that, as long as the workers were united, they were invincible. That notion comes in the category of romantic but wrong. Nine months later, the subsidy ended, and it is clear from Perkins's incisive analysis how the general strike came about. Her comprehensive account of how it progressed shows that the miners' cause was doomed from the start. Much blame was heaped on those trade unionists who either fought with the miners half-heartedly or refused to fight at all. But the real problem was the state of the industry. Thanks to the debilitated condition of the economy - exacerbated by Winston Churchill's decision to return to the gold standard - many pits were near to bankruptcy. Greedy owners combined with fearful miners to oppose closures. That meant that a national settlement with ""not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day"" was a heroic but unattainable aspiration. The claim that the miners could win was a cruel deception. I was brought up in the belief that AJ Cook, the secretary of the Miners' Federation, was the hero of 1926. As Perkins makes clear, without resorting to the crude device of actually saying so, Cook - all rhetoric and no strategy - undermined the prospects of the claim which he supported at least as effectively as did Jimmy Thomas, the NUR general secretary who was officially designated a traitor. Ramsay Macdonald feared that ""there will be a general strike to save Arthur Cook's face"". That is only one of the parallels between 1926 and 1984 which the perceptive Perkins identifies. Arthur Scargill remembered Cook's rhetoric but forgot his tactical ineptitude. Although I was wrong about the hero of the general strike, I always correctly identified the slightly comic villain. It was Churchill, a man who in Perkins's memorable phrase ""thought consensus was for the common people"". The obsession with the communist conspiracy to conquer the world - which had made him the chief advocate of a British expedition to support the White Russian rearguard - convinced him that the general strike was a prelude to a Bolshevik revolution. Throughout, his behaviour was almost as intolerable to his colleagues in government as it was intentionally provocative to his enemies in the TUC. He insisted that ""food convoys"" were accompanied by totally unnecessary armoured cars in order to increase public apprehension about the prospects of an armed insurrection and he was encouraged by the prime minister to edit the British Gazette - a propaganda news sheet - because it diverted him from attempts to take over the BBC. Churchill's responsibility for the deteriorating terms of trade, which made the price of British coal uncompetitive, is slightly mitigated by an incident which Perkins reports with admirable understatement. Immediately after Baldwin made him chancellor of the exchequer - more to entice him back into the Tory party than in the hope of rescuing the economy - Churchill was advised by Treasury civil servants to return to the gold standard, thus overvaluing the pound. ""He arranged a dinner party to hear the arguments on both sides. Keynes under-performed and Churchill decided to take the advice of his official."" That made British coal even more uncompetitive. The general strike was the inevitable consequence. The general strike lasted for nine days. The miners remained proud, poor and in dispute for another eight months. They were driven back to work by hunger, with the bitter conviction that if the other unions had been equally brave, justice would have prevailed. Almost 50 years later they squared up to the owners and government. ""Almost certainly in explicit recognition of the 'betrayal' of 1926, the NUM refused to solicit support from the TUC."" In every other particular, history repeated itself. After 1926, the miners have been the regular scapegoats for government failures to manage the economy successfully, and the NUM has taken a special pride in fighting to the last ditch. The union created the conditions that encouraged Ted Heath to commit political suicide and, according to Challenge to Democracy, the diaries of Sir Ronald McIntosh, it continued to menace the nation. On November 22 1974, McIntosh - director general of the National Economic Development Council (Neddy) - was told by the permanent secretary at the Department of Employment ""that the NUM militants would force through a high settlement ... and that there would be a balance of payments collapse"". And so it, more or less, turned out. The modern equivalent of Red Friday was followed 10 years later by the blackest days in the coal industry's history. The badly led union chose the wrong moment to strike and was beaten. Margaret Thatcher's scheme to destroy the industry proceeded according to plan. McIntosh's diary - published a respectable 30 years after the events which it records took place - relates to an age and economic attitude which now seem almost as distant as the general strike. The author himself - dapper, supremely self-confident and immensely able - was typical of an earlier type of civil servant. It was a time when officials, no less than ministers, believed in the power of the government in a way which is certainly out of fashion today. McIntosh describes a statement made by the prime minister at a press conference as ""good and very helpful"". Not surprisingly. The operative paragraph began: ""Neddy is to mastermind the whole programme."" It is inconceivable that a prime minister of any party would say that today. Diaries of the McIntosh sort leave readers with the impression that the author spent most of his time in restaurants. And there is no doubt that McIntosh took lunch very seriously. Some of the reports of his assignations are instructive. On October 5 1976 he lunched with his old friend Roy Jenkins at Brooks's Club. Jenkins, on his way to become president of the European Communities Commission, thought that an economic crisis was ""calculated to produce a political change"" and said ""a little wistfully"" that he wondered if he had been right to leave British politics at this time. So the idea of a new centre party had begun to germinate in Jenkins's head three years before the idea became public. But the diaries' importance is the record which they provide of a dead civilisation. McIntosh was one of the gentleman in Whitehall who knew best."
8,"Keynes: The Twentieth Century's Most Influential Economist <br />by Peter Clarke<br />224pp, Bloomsbury, &pound;16.99  Keynes: The Return of the Master <br />by Robert Skidelsky<br />214pp, Allen Lane, &pound;20  Keynes would not have been surprised. The errors of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, which led to runaway growth and unbounded market euphoria, were essentially intellectual. Britain and America had the misfortune to be led by two supremely clever men who were not interested in ideas. ""Globalisation, free markets and light-touch regulation"" became the slogans of an era which president and prime minister accepted as the sovereign prescription for prosperity. Neither Robert Skidelsky nor Peter Clarke leaves much doubt that the proponents of the ""Anglo-American consensus"" based their economic policies on the prejudices of private enterprise which they chose not to challenge - partly because their own inclination led them in the same direction and partly because the better option did not possess the virtue of simplicity.  Both books - despite the inevitable compression, wonderfully lucid expositions of complicated ideas - remark on the significance of the contrast between Keynes's reception on either side of the Atlantic and in continental Europe. Clarke explains that ""France, with its tradition of l'&eacute;tat tut&eacute;laire rather than principled laissez-faire, did not need to be disabused of these classical fallacies"". Antagonism to the state is an Anglo-Saxon syndrome. The cultural differences persist and are reflected in disagreements over the importance of an unregulated labour market and the government's role in regulating hedge funds and off-shore banking. It is worth noting that ""dirigiste"" France and Germany began to move out of recession earlier than Britain.  Clarke and Skidelsky will claim, with absolute justification, that their books have a more fundamental purpose than explaining the causes of today's recession. But Skidelsky takes what he calls ""another Great Depression"" as his starting point, and Clarke begins with the assertion that talk of a ""slowdown now seems risible"" since we are in ""the worst [economic] scenario ... since the 1930s"". Without the slump and the increasing rejection of the notion that ""markets are automatically self-correcting"" - a heresy which Keynes abandoned in the early 1930s - neither book would have been written. The message is that Keynes is back, not just as a name to be invoked when convenient, but as a guide through the perilous years that lie ahead.  It is with considerable trepidation that I take issue with a central point in Skidelsky's analysis, though I am comforted by the thought that my disagreement may concern politics rather than economics. There are still many opponents of economic regulation who insist that the ""market is self-correcting"". Indeed, I was on Any Questions when one of their number said that the banking collapse was the necessary antidote to the inflation in house prices that profligate lending had brought about. In a sense, that is right. But the market ""corrects itself"" at a price which is paid by the homeless, the unemployed and the low paid. It is the free-marketeer's economic equivalent of the Carthaginian peace. They make a wilderness and call it equilibrium.  The rich - often the rich whose greed and incompetence has brought the crisis about - generally escape the worst consequences of collapse. Keynes wrote that ""the sound banker ... is one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way along with his fellows so that no one really can blame him"". There have not been many of those paragons about during the last couple of years. Keynes was a meritocrat, not an egalitarian. But he would not have regarded a ""correction"" which basically spared the rich but penalised the poor as worth the name. As both Clarke and Skidelsky make clear, he was not just a mathematician turned economist. He was a philosopher. Despite his early insistence that personal morality was a question for individual conscience, not general agreement, he had a clear view of the good society.  Much of the attraction of both books lies in their exposition of the ideas which are overshadowed by the importance of his work on managing the economic cycle. What Gordon Brown called ""the crude Keynesianism of the 70s"" was the acceptance that economic activity could be stimulated by increasing ""effective demand"", that the increase could be promoted by ""deficit financing"", and that austerity - the ""remedy"" of the 1930s - increased rather than reduced the depression. Those fundamental truths, now accepted and acted upon by the prime minister and the president of the United States, are enough to explain Keynes's return to political acceptability. But he was the originator of other ideas that possessed greater sophistication, if less immediate application to public policy. Not all of them made as big a contribution to the management of a civilised society as The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money In his Treatise on Probability, Keynes concludes that ""probability cannot simply be measured by observed frequency"". No matter how often a coin is tossed, the chances of it coming down tails are always 50-50. That assertion - true if the calculation is made immediately before the coin is tossed, but dubious if the assessment is made several tosses earlier - relates to his most famous aphorism. ""In the long run we are all dead"" is a dangerous truth on which to construct public policy, and Keynes's judgment on the rise of the prewar dictators proves it to be so. ""If we are at peace in the short run, that is something. The best we can do is put off disaster, if only in the hope ... that something will turn up."" Keynes as Mr Micawber is a new gloss on a complicated personality. Keynes, Clarke tells us, was said by a colleague to have ""a wonderful memory for arguments, but no memory for their authors"". That selective myopia led to suggestions that he had ""appropriated"" the theory of effective demand from James Meade. Apparently he also ""borrowed without generating any ill feeling"" the concept of the ""multiplier"", one of those ideas which seem obvious after they have been expounded by a person of genius. The true origins of what we now call ""Keynesianism"" barely matter. His name has come to embody a prescription which politicians ignored at an immense cost to the people whom they represent. Skidelsky and Clarke have written books - each barely 200 pages - which ought to be required reading for every prospective minister."
8,"There is much to like about Vince Cable and much to admire. But nothing reveals the secret of his success as graphically as his persona. While Nick Clegg, his party leader, subscribes to the David Cameron theory that successful politicians ought to look and sound like Rolls-Royce salesmen, Cable has the demeanour of a Yorkshire undertaker on a day trip to Bridlington. His willingness to answer to the name of ""Vince"" is more proof of disdain for fashion. He is the politics of substance made flesh. His popularity is a vindication of those of us who argue that ideas are more important than image. If he had not stooped to make that Cambridge Union joke about the prime minister evolving from Stalin into Mr Bean, he might have achieved parliamentary sanctification ahead of Frank Field. As it is, he will have to be satisfied with his memoirs being received with applause that few other politicians, writing in such an inhibited style, could expect. ""Vince"" can describe personal tragedy without being mawkish and revisit party rivalries without being suspected of repaying old debts because he is ""genuine""  not bogus genuine, but genuine genuine."

Published diaries are usually a betrayal, since they reveal the contents of conversations which were thought to be confidential. And they are almost invariably attempts either to enhance - or, in the case of fallen idols, rehabilitate - the reputation of the diarist. On the first charge, David Blunkett must be found not guilty. The diaries contain a couple of sideswipes at Jack Straw and John Prescott for daring, in what they believed to be private discussions, to question Blunkett's conduct. But apart from an unlikely story about the Prime Minister seriously considering sacking Gordon Brown, there are virtually no indiscretions which can be regarded as a breach of trust - though Dawn Primarolo may not be happy to know that Blunkett incorrectly anticipated her sacking. The absence of damaging indiscretions is to be applauded. But it is less the result of proper reticence than a consequence of his diaries' character. They are essentially personal rather than political. Their clear purpose, money aside, is to explain and therefore excuse. It is difficult to believe that they will have that result.Every public mistake, no matter how trivial, is painfully regurgitated, and the descriptions are invariably preludes to confessions and pleas for absolution. An appearance on Celebrity Mastermind, which would have been best forgotten, is glorified with the question: 'If I make a fool of myself, what does it matter? The most important thing is that it means a &pound;2,500 donation to the Sheffield Hospice.' The result of Blunkett's self-absorption is therefore both a disappointment and a relief. The only damage the diaries will do the government is the creation of the impression that ministers are far more vainglorious than is, in most instances, the case. But the reader learns little or nothing about 'what really went on' when great issues were at stake.Diaries which are advertised as laying political life bare are almost always a confidence trick played on the gullible public. The implication of their publication, stated overtly when they are serialised in newspapers, is that they reveal the raw, red meat of immediate emotion, the feelings which, for better or for worse, architects of vital decisions experience in moments of triumph and disaster. Even if the authors make what, at the time of writing, they believed to be honest entries, careful editing always follows. The Blunkett text leaves little doubt the original material has been 'improved'.Bunkett's second resignation from the cabinet followed allegations that he had not declared, in exactly the manner required, his financial interest in DNA Bioscience, a company with which the government did business. The story broke in October 2005 and Blunkett resigned on 2 November. His diary entry for 18 May that year, immediately after he rejoined the government and six months before he was again forced out, reads: 'I did the normal declaration of interest with Sir Richard Mottram (the permanent secretary). I have already made the basic declaration on the evening of May 6 including the trust for the shareholding in DNA Bioscience.' To me that reads like a retrospective explanation of the error which he claimed, probably correctly, was an honest mistake. Why on earth should he have chosen to remind his diary of what he had done 12 days earlier? And why, if the entries recorded events as they happened is so much described in the past tense?It would be quite extraordinary if a man, contemplating the wreckage of a once great career, did not try to put the best possible gloss on the years of glory behind him. So perhaps we should not complain that Blunkett is the hero of the political entries in his diary. He is wise. As early as 7 October 2001 he warned that the Afghan intervention would drag on 'because there was (sic) no coordinated strategy between the United States and Britain'. He is loyal. Despite his doubts about the Afghan campaign he urged colleagues to support Tony Blair's 'clear vision of the way ahead'. He is brave. On 7 March 2002 he asked the Prime Minister: 'Why aren't you doing something about the Middle East and the Palestine-Israel conflict? Why are you backing the Americans?' And he is influential. By 13 March, 'Tony's work on Palestine yielded fruit. This does make a difference to Tony's position which looked disastrous at the beginning of the week. Now we must all strengthen his arm.' David Blunkett was always on the side of political virtue.All that being said, it has to be admitted that when the Blunkett tapes turn to private matters the author spares himself very little embarrassing exposure. Indeed, fastidious people will argue that he spares neither himself - nor the reader who is not motivated by prurience - anything like enough. Having made the wholly legitimate claim that he is entitled to keep his private life private, he goes into detail after uninhibited detail about those parts of his personal conduct which he wants to be better understood. Excursions to Annabelle's nightclub, like his apparently platonic liaison with Sally Anderson, would not be worth a mention had Blunkett not chosen to deal with them himself. As it is, the only necessary comment is that his treatment of his private life confirms that he has never been held back by emotional inhibitions.We learn that, under pressure of work and the strain imposed by a tempestuous personal life, he felt 'the world opening up' beneath him. It would be a harder heart than mine which did not feel pity for the pathetic figure that the diary so graphically described. But is pity what he wants? Should not pride alone - putting aside ambition - have encouraged him to keep the moments of black despair to himself? Blunkett is what is called a 'modern man'. That is clear from the frequency with which he hugs those around him. He is not embarrassed about describing his innermost feelings. There will be many previously sympathetic people who are embarrassed by reading about them.However, the diaries suggest that David Blunkett believes that by confessing and accepting his mistakes, he will be exculpated - most of his sins being more venial than mortal, so that forgiveness is hardly necessary. He certainly has a nice line in the apology which is, in reality, a plea for sympathy and understanding. On9 October 2005 he wrote: 'If I could turn the clock back ... I would run a mile from DNA Bioscience and suppers with Sally Anderson. How can so small a mistake have led to so much?' One of the reasons that he paid so heavy a price was the penalty of hubris. He did not grasp the fact that his comparatively trivial mistakes were compounded by his self-righteous attitude. Not surprisingly, his fall from grace produced the greatest outburst of cabinet Schadenfreude in modern times. On the evidence of The Blunkett Tapes he has still not got the message.The only justification for the publication of political diaries is the power which they might possess to instruct the general public about the way in which government works. That was the avowed intention of Dick Crossman who began the fashion, and it has been echoed by the other diarists who have followed in his footsteps. No doubt Blunkett will claim the same. But the tapes tell us little we did not know: Gordon Brown is a tough and sometimes cantankerous Chancellor of the Exchequer; most of the Cabinet would have dumped the Millennium Dome but the Prime Minister insisted that it go ahead; Alastair Campbell leaks convenient news to favoured newspapers in the hope of deflecting them from publishing damaging revelations. The Blunkett Tapes are not about government. They are about David Blunkett.<b>One man and his dogs</b><b>Born:</b> 6 June 1947, Sheffield.<b>Education:</b> Schools for the blind in Sheffield and Shrewsbury, and the University of Sheffield.<b>Political career: </b>Elected to Sheffield City Council in 1970 at the age of 22, becoming the youngest ever councillor. <b>1987</b> Elected Member of Parliament for Sheffield Brightside. <b>1997-2001</b> Education Secretary. <b>2001-2004</b> Home Secretary (resigned). <b>2005</b> Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (resigned).<b>Hounded:</b> Blunkett's guide dogs have been frequent sources of humour in Westminster.

3,"ï»¿That Christopher Meyer's memoirs have been as controversial as their subtitle confidently asserts them to be is already a matter of record. But, read in the round, how does the book as a whole actually emerge? My answer is that Meyer's book is both better and worse than the headline-generating extracts suggest. It is better because, contrary to the implication of its subtitle, this is not only a book about 9/11 and the Iraq war, crucially important though these subjects are. Meyer's account of these events is painted on a wider canvas. His Washington years stretched from autumn 1997 to the start of 2003, so he was gone by the time the war began. The majority of his time in DC fell within the Clinton presidency, not the Bush one. Indeed Bush barely makes an appearance in this memoir until around half way through. Seen in that light, this is an important book about what it was like to be Britain's most senior and lustrous ambassador at a time when the prime minister enjoyed a direct line to the White House for which there are few precedents. The strength of the Blair-Clinton and the Blair-Bush relationships was of vast advantage to Meyer, as he acknowledges. It meant that long before 9/11, though certainly in its aftermath, he was able to bathe in reflected glory. It was, as he rightly says, a good time to be British in America. That was just as true in the Clinton as in the Blair years; there were ""Blair for President"" chants in Chicago as early as 1999, Meyer recalls. But the Downing Street-White House relationship was always the worm in the bud for the embassy, and by the time of Iraq it became both pettily and substantively intolerable to an ambassador who had an unusual taste for the limelight. Even before Bush, a lot of British discourse about America was mere caricature: under every president since JFK, too many British commentators have succumbed to the lazy temptation to regard the United States as a country of mad people governed by buffoons. Under Bush that tendency has become much more extreme. So it is useful to be reminded by Meyer that Bush is a more substantial figure than most here have come to regard him. And it is gratifying to read Meyer expounding wisdoms about America that can only come from experience. Every September, Meyer recalls, he would gather new arrivals to the embassy together and give them a little pep talk. The core of that message was always the same: ""Think of the US as a foreign country, then you will be pleasantly surprised by the many things you find in common with this most generous and hospitable of people. Think of America as Britain writ large and you risk coming to grief; American attitudes to patriotism, religion, crime and punishment, schooling, sex, the outside world, can be very different from those of Europeans, including the British."" Anyone who has spent time in America will recognise the accuracy of that. Meyer is wisely unsentimental, too, about the so-called ""special relationship"". The phrase was banned from use while he was ambassador, quite rightly, and he smartly observes that the only countries that can truly lay claim to such a status in Washington - in the sense of being able to have significant influence on US politics and policy - are Ireland, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, and certainly not Britain, even under Blair or Thatcher. My dissatisfaction with Meyer's book is not that he has written it. It is that his indiscretion is selective and even calculated. As the now celebrated extracts showed, Meyer has little compunction about putting the stiletto into politicians - and into Cherie Blair, who did the Meyers many kindnesses in her time, for which she is meanly rewarded here. Meyer is also more generous to Gordon Brown in these pages - I wonder why that could be? - than he was in private, when he regularly complained about the chancellor's repeated and childish snubs. He is also protective towards fellow diplomats, officials and mandarins. Meyer's relationship with the former diplomat Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief-of-staff, was pivotal to his Washington years. So were his connections to John Sawers and Matthew Rycroft, both of them senior ex-Washington embassy figures who worked for Blair in vital periods. Crucial players all, yet they move as silently through Meyer's account as Inspector Bucket does through much of Bleak House Then there is the Catherine question. Christopher Meyer was an ambassadorial moderniser - nice, approachable, sociable and very comfortable with the media. He and Catherine were high-profile Washingtonians, and there was much talk towards the end of his term that they would decamp to New York on his retirement to become a Manhattan power couple to rival Harry and Tina themselves. It sometimes seemed to me that they risked overstepping the mark in this networking, and Meyer's account of Catherine's eurosceptic conversations with Rupert Murdoch and Richard Perle rather confirms that. Running through this book there is not just a mandarin's frustration with ministers but a radical Conservative's disdain towards Labour, even though I firmly believe that Meyer mostly did an exceptional job on Blair's behalf. In the end, though, it all comes inescapably back to Iraq. Iraq is inevitably both the pivotal subject in Meyer's account and the one on which he allows himself the most sustained exposition of his own views. Meyer makes a powerful case for the view that Britain could have caused the Bush administration to delay the invasion until late 2003, giving time to bring France and Russia onside for a second UN resolution, perhaps even forcing Saddam to quit, but certainly enabling proper attention to be given to a UN-centred plan for the post-Saddam Iraq. Would it have worked? Who can now say? But Meyer and many others of us have every right to be extremely angry that it was never given a chance. Martin Kettle was the Guardian's Washington bureau chief from 1997 to 2001."
10,"High Society<br />by Ben Elton<br />Bantam Press £16.99, pp352 Ben Elton is not a neutral in the debate about drugs. Not for him the compromises of the current Home Secretary (curiously similar to those of the imaginary Home Secretary in his book) or, for that matter,  The Observer. He wants complete legalisation of all drug use - from heroin and crack cocaine to cannabis. Anything else is deceitful and purposeless because, as the central character in  High Society - campaigning Labour MP Peter Paget - puts it, either we are or have been users ourselves or know someone who is or has been a user; we are thus law-breakers or condone law breaking and so undermine the cornerstone of social   order. If the law does not go with the grain of social reality, then it is an ass. Drug use is now so extensive that trying to draw boundaries between class A and class C drugs is futile - and what results is the devastation and hypocrisy portrayed  here. Better legalisation of all drugs, opening up the possibility of their proper regulation and of honestly confronting what they do to people. Elton's book in many ways should not succeed. His characters are one-dimensional and when he uses them to deploy the arguments for legalisation the results are gawky; a very good comedian abandoning his craft and instead lumbering into the pulpit to preach. The main plot is predictable; we know from the moment Paget's assistant admires her boss that the subsequent affair and its denouement are inevitable. The drug-saturated rock star Tommy Hanson is a cartoon cut-out and his adventures stretch credulity to the limits. Elton should take a self-denying ordinance and be more sparing in delivering sex scenes; despite his best efforts they do not work. And yet. The book is saved by its pace and verve and the author's passion for his subject. Involvement with Britain's drug laws has laid all of his characters low and Elton's portrait of Jessie, the Scottish prostitute kept in thrall to her minders by their making her dependent on heroin, shows how it is on the streets and how illegality, expense and heroin's cruel addictive quality make the bonds close to impossible for her to break. For vast swathes of the British, experimenters with illegal drugs perhaps in their youth but now lapsed into alcohol and tobacco, the current evolving compromises seem a reasonable halfway house - recognising reality but also cautious about signalling that heroin is no more problematic than coffee. This is the overstated premise at the heart of the book. There is certainly a very strong British drug economy and drug subculture but, unlike alcohol, it remains a subculture - so the comparison made with Prohibition by Peter Paget does not stand. The book would have had more tension if Elton had allowed the anti-legalisation arguments to be marshalled by someone more sympathetic than an unsatisfactory Tory Shadow Home Secretary and in the end his hero undoes himself by lying to a mendacious press about his affair rather than losing the argument on drugs. Yet as I raced to the end, I found myself applauding Elton. This is a tough subject tackled with courage and commitment. The great Victorian novelists managed to crusade and to entertain. Elton's book, despite its weaknesses, is cast in that tradition."
10,"How to Be Idle <br /> by Tom Hodgkinson<br /> 288pp, Hamish Hamilton, £12.99   In Praise of Slow<br /> by Carl Honore<br /> 310pp, Orion, £16.99   The Play Ethic <br /> by Pat Kane<br /> 458pp, Macmillan, £12.99 Soft Power <br />by Joseph Nye <br />208pp, Public Affairs, £18.99 Status Syndrome<br /> by Michael Marmot <br />320pp, Bloomsbury, £12.99  It's that time of year. The children have started a new school year, and their parents are beginning a new work year. It's a fresh term; the transition from the holiday to the work season is upon us. And every year there is the same cancerous question: why is the acceleration in tempo and pressure as we leave those restorative holidays behind not a source of well-being and happiness? There must surely be ways of marrying work and life that are more accommodating to our humanity. Are holidays really the only time when we can find time for living at a human pace?  The quest for happiness is starting to preoccupy the national conversation more and more. The work-life balance movement, at first derided as the obsession of New Labour ministers and some trendy employers, is coming of age; more and more companies want to offer their workforces some autonomy over how they use their time and are finding that if they don't, they lose their best and brightest. Workers will go on strike to insist that they have more control over their time. A new generation of economists is inquiring into whether the century-long assumption of economics - that economic man and woman have an inbuilt motivation to want more profit, more wages and more material goods and that monetary motivation is always a reliable compass to action - is still correct. If money doesn't reliably make us happy, then economics had better remodel how it conceives of human behaviour. We might be less self-interested; maybe even concerned about our happiness in the round. And then what happens to the profit motive?   A growing number of men and women in mid-career seem ready to abandon the prospect of material wealth for a downsized life in which they are in control of how they spend their time. The interest in alternative medicine, therapies and diets mushrooms; pharmaceutical companies offer us lifestyle drugs that keep depression at bay. We want well-being. And now comes a rash of books from some accomplished journalist/commentators (Tom Hodgkinson, Carl Honore and Pat Kane), all of whom seem to be practising what they preach (damn them), urging us variously to take play seriously, to go slower and to celebrate idleness.   On top there is an American academic - Joseph Nye - arguing that how the west lives can be a source of compelling ""soft power"" to the rest of the world, persuading it voluntarily that because it wants to be like us it will be readier to do our bidding; and a British academic (Michael Marmot), who shows how good health, an essential component of happiness, is crucially determined by the higher your standing in the organisation for which you work and society at large,   rather than the amount of money you earn. Taken as a whole, these books at the very least suggest that something is going on.   If Nye is right, could the idler (Hodgkinson), the player (Kane) and the slowcoach (Honore) offer a better response to terrorism than shocking and awing cowed Muslim populations? Their preoccupation, freely expressed in a typical western society, is how to live well free from the injunctions of the state, church or social compulsions - more appealing that we might guess to populations in thrall to the unrelenting rhythms of religion. Of the three invocations to live differently, Kane's is the most arresting, with its appeal to celebration of a play ethic; Hodgkinson and Honore are treading well-worn paths in their appeal to be idle and slow respectively, although they do it well. Hodgkinson, in particular, glories in reminding us that idleness has a long tradition. But taking play seriously? Kane is certainly on to something fresh and insightful.   He rebels against the notion that purpose can be achieved only by the disciplines of work, and against those who argue that work is what gives meaning to our lives because it is via work that we act on the world, via work that we interact socially and via work that we achieve status. He chides the Calvinistic Gordon Brown for his view that work is the salve for every economic and social problem. For Kane the point of life is not to work and be a worker; it is to play and be a player - and thus be both a better worker and solve that happiness riddle alike. What we want is less work-life balance, more a recognition that the alpha and omega of good living is to know how to play - and to insert the play ethic into everything we do.   Play is about imagination, experimentation and being confident enough to take a chance, all in a context in which, because it's a game, nothing vital attaches to the outcome; and if we start with the notion that we are ""players"" and that the world will not come to an end if what we plan doesn't come off, there is much more chance of living edgily, of finding time, of building rewarding relationships and of being genuinely creative in how we live and work.   Kane argues that our language subliminally recognises the role of play: we talk about putting an idea or concept in play; a company that is the object of takeover speculation is ""in play""; a politician on the up is a ""player"". Yet we never stop to think about why we use play in contexts that the wider work ethic would insist are the ultimate in seriousness. Kane insists that the language is pointing us in the right direction, if only we recognised it. Of course all the world's a stage, and we are merely players with our exits and entrances; the trick is to lighten up and recognise that all aspects of life are more about gaming than working. There's fun to be had in taking over a company or challenging for the leadership of a political party - and once you locate what you are doing in those terms you are readier to experiment with the unexpected or devise a winning stratagem. Moreover, our language - talking about play and players - recognises that this is what is going on.   It's a nice thesis, except that Kane doesn't know whether he is inventing a universal theory of life or merely saying play is valuable, even for those in work. He is not sure whether he wants us just to play at everything, or that to play is a better way of achieving the outcomes that we normally look to work to provide. Every trendy button is pressed, whether the role of hackers in spreading the IT gospel (particularly in Finland) to, inevitably, St Luke's advertising agency - with lots of indulgent meanderings about his own life. It's very easy to get lost.   Nor does he recognise the way in which work confers status, and thus wellbeing. Michael Marmot's important study  Status Syndrome shows that - in every culture - our happiness and health are closely related to the place we occupy in the status hierarchy, and that that the key to status is our occupation. Happy, healthy, long-lived civil servants don't play more than their peers; they just need to be one rung above them in career grades. Kane, enjoying his status as writer, thinker and provocateur, has lost sight of the fact that what motivates everyone else is just the same - and climbing up an organisation's grades or doing enviable, well-regarded work is fundamental to most people's sense of themselves. Work is where it's ultimately at. None the less you can't read his book without accepting that we all could play more while we do it.   The question is whether we could also go slower and find more time for idleness. I found Honore's and Hodgkinson's books not only entertaining, but getting under my skin. Reaching middle life - or even late middle life - with a growing sense that I need to reorder my priorities made me a receptive reader. Honore's hymn to the pleasure of allowing everything its proper time - from eating and cooking to just moving around - is well executed and persuasive; and you learn about a worldwide ""Slow Movement"" that seems to be gaining ground everywhere. There are slow food groups, slow sex therapists (tantrists), slow doctors, slow sports experts - and so it goes on until finally you wonder how you ever could have mixed with all those fasties.    I'm not sure, however, whether he concedes sufficiently the pleasures of doing things fast. At one stage he acknowledges wryly how quickly he was driving to make an appointment to enjoy a meal of ritualised slowness in Italy - and reproaches himself. But the paradox is that Honore could never have accumulated the impressive evidence for the case he makes without the whole fast infrastructure of modern life, from the internet to air travel. Like Kane, he falls into the trap of trying to turn an important corrective to too much speed into a philosophy of life. I enjoy the (too few) occasions when I chop vegetables, linger over a meal or just hang out; but I enjoy speed, too. There is pleasure in crossing the Atlantic in a cruise ship; but most of us opt for the 747 not from perversity, but because we value our time. Life is finite. Most of us want to die with a sense of a life well lived rather than the satisfaction that we took our time. That said, there is no doubt that we overdo speed.   And we overdo being busy. Tom Hodgkinson, founder of the Idler magazine, takes us on an indulgent (but that's his mission) tour of the satisfactions of being idle. Indeed I was so impressed by his chapter on the virtues of the nap that one sunny lunchtime I headed for the park to fall asleep in the sun - which I did, feeling gloriously guiltless and assertive about it. The directionless ramble; the joy of inhaling cigarette smoke; the pleasure of sleeping in; the anticipation of the first drink of the day - Hodgkinson knows where pleasure is to be found. The more I read, however, the more I felt that he protested too much; that we don't need citations from long-dead poets and scribes to justify napping in the sun. The point about being idle is not to work at it, surely; indeed one of the virtues of work is that it offers us something to be idle from - as well as offering us a sense of purpose. To make idleness our central purpose is to turn it into work - and then even idleness becomes infected by the work ethic. It's all, as with Kane and Honore, about proportion.   The debate about idleness, play and speed would strike any one of the billions of workers in the third world who earn no more than a couple of dollars a day as something from another planet - but one none the less to which they aspire. Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government, has built upon one of the themes in an earlier book - The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Superpower Can't Go it Alone - arguing that what he   calls ""soft power"" is an indispensable element in contemporary diplomacy. Hard power is the coercive military strength of the 19th century; but it doesn't work in the 21st. Threats come less from competing nation states than from terrorist sub-groups; and most diplomacy these days is about persuading states voluntarily to sign a treaty or join an alliance to help us in some endeavour - to fight terrorism, say - for which they in turn have to win domestic support. And that can best be won, certainly in relations with the less developed world, if their elites and citizens alike want to join the alliance because they like their ally's values and the lifestyles it boasts. Nye cites the BBC World Service as a key element in Britain's soft power; it is a window on a universe that its listeners worldwide respect and want to emulate.   Thus, if you agree with Nye's thesis, the other authors under review are not just advocates for seeking wellbeing; they are advertisements for the way the British are trying to live, part of our soft power. Nye is excoriating about the way Bush - and by implication Blair - has undermined the west's soft power in the Middle East by their invasion of Iraq. I know the British Council, for example, feels profoundly compromised by Britain's close association with American foreign policy, and many CEOs of FTSE 100 companies are uneasy about how British companies are seen as American surrogates and fear for their long-term prospects in some key Asian and Middle Eastern markets. Soft power - and the values and lifestyles behind it - may be invisible, but it is nevertheless potent, and we sacrificed a lot of it to make common cause with US neo-conservatives who want to make America feared for its uncontestable military might.   But we can relax a little. Kane, Honore and Hodgkinson are doing their small part to help our image and limit the appeal of al-Qaida. It's a far-fetched thesis, but not so far-fetched that it can be rejected out of hand. The happier we are, the better - not just for ourselves, but as a reason to be copied rather than opposed."
10,"The Great Unravelling: From Boom to Bust in Three Short Years<br /> by Paul Krugman<br /> 464pp, Allen Lane, £18.99    The Roaring Nineties<br /> by Joseph Stiglitz<br />  432pp, Allen Lane, £18.99    Britain's political class and commentariat just don't get contemporary America. They don't understand the revolutionary nature of US conservatism and the profundity of its ambitions. They don't understand the extraordinary self-serving venality of corporate America and its Republican allies. They don't understand the ruthless pursuit of radical conservative interests and disregard for all others. They think, like Tony Blair, that America is having an eccentric wobble - and that if George Bush is engaged with, it will sooner or later be business as usual.  They should read these two books, by two of America's best economists and most forensic critics, and be disabused. I should declare an interest; I have long regarded the Nobel prize-winning Joseph Stiglitz and Princeton University's Paul Krugman as two of the best around. And so it proves. Stiglitz's careful dissection of the follies of the ""Roaring Nineties"" and the conservative thinking that produced them - penetrating the Clinton administration - is as good as it gets, and while I am wary of collections of columns as dull retreads (I plead guilty to having inflicted one upon the reading public myself), Krugman gets away with it on two counts. First, I only read a few of them in the original; and second, he begins his book with an introduction of such power that it is worth the price alone.   Krugman states quite baldly a truth from which many still shrink: today's conservatives are radical revolutionaries who do not accept the legitimacy of America's current political system and aim to subvert it. Their goals are the establishment of an American military imperium abroad, under American rather than international law, and to minimise the responsibilities of the rich and corporate America to the common weal at home. This is so breathtaking, says Krugman, that to say it risks being condemned as alarmist. Indeed, quoting Henry Kissinger, he argues it is one of the characteristics of revolutionary power that it draws just this response; it is those who ""counsel adaptation to circumstances who are considered balanced and sane"". Consensual mainstream opinion cannot come to terms with the radicalism of the revolutionaries - it is too far outside its ambit. It seems delusional, almost hysterical, to acknowledge what is really happening.   Krugman sets out the five maxims that must govern reporting in such a context: don't assume any policy proposals make sense in terms of their stated goals; do some homework to discover the real goals; don't assume the normal rules of politics apply; expect a revolutionary power to respond to criticism by attacking; and don't think there's a limit to a revolutionary power's objectives. His columns set out how he follows his own maxims in explaining the range of Bush's policies since he took office - from the conduct of economic policy, to how Bush and his political adviser, Karl Rove, shamelessly exploited September 11 for partisan ends.   It is a revelatory picture, and it will leave those who don't know America well shaking their heads in disbelief. Can it really be true that the regulators of the media and the securities industry are so completely compromised by their association with their Republican bosses and the industries they regulate? How is it possible that any government at any time could organise tax cuts to the rich on Bush's scale and present them as a patriotic economic stimulus that only traitors disagree with? Is it possible that any group of men and women could reward themselves as extravagantly as contemporary American chief executive officers, claiming enormous benefits for the companies they run, when in fact the benefits are paltry? How do people become this self-serving? And perhaps most worrying of all, Krugman shows how the American media have given up on active scrutiny - partly because the truth seems so incredible and partly because a sizeable proportion is owned by Republican interests.   Why has this happened? Stiglitz's answer is that the American centre and left have allowed the right to win the economic argument with a set of market fundamentalist propositions that are downright wrong - but which have the pleasing consequence for conservatives of validating their every prejudice and allowing them to dress up serving their own interests as promoting the common good. It was the confluence of this thinking with the unique circumstances of the post-cold war 1990s that led to the extraordinary and unsustainable boom. As chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers for four years and chief economist of the World Bank for three, Stiglitz had a bird's eye view of how the contagion infected the Democrats - and made them collaborators with the trends they deplored.   There is an element of confessional breast-beating in Stiglitz's book - and occasionally the overlap with his previous work,  Globalisation and Its Discontents , gives you a sense of dj vu. Some of this Stiglitz has said before. None the less his account of how a group of smart economists and policy thinkers with impeccable liberal credentials found themselves zealously cutting public spending, deregulating, privatising and even cutting capital gains tax, is important and well-marshalled. Time and again the combination of powerful corporate lobbies and appeals to the ""rightness"" of the new conservative economic consensus made it impossible for the Clinton administration to make progress, or even to shape deregulation in a less damaging way.   Stiglitz is a stout defender of the role of government, basing his view on the economics of information for which he won a Nobel prize. Of course markets don't work perfectly; they are structured so that insiders have more information than outsiders - so that prices don't reflect costs and excess profits and rents abound. Unless government is on hand to correct the imbalance with regulation, promoting competition and acting itself, markets will produce all kinds of follies - of which the 90s boom was the quintessential expression. The hangover of debt and bankruptcy is costing the US economy hundreds of billions in lost output; and all because the insiders - CEOs, investment bankers, corporate lobbyists - went on the rampage, aided and abetted by Republicans. Stiglitz's account of how the lobbyists shaped the 1996 Telecoms Act, opening up telecommunications to new entrants with minimal regulation in the name of ""competition"", is an eye-opener. In effect, despite self-serving talk of competition, they were giving a licence for an orgy of bids and deals as the industry jostled for what it knew were captive franchises (mobile and cable networks).   The strength of the two books is their authors' deployment of economic analysis to expose the duplicity, wrong-headedness and costs of conservative economic policies - and their streetwise awareness of who benefits and why. The weakness is that, while both deplore what is happening, neither offers a satisfactory explanation of quite why conservative America has the grip it has. Krugman at one juncture throws his hands up in the air: ""I should admit,"" he writes, ""that I am not entirely sure why this is happening."" It's just clear that ""the right want to do all these things"" (abolish tax on capital, strip away all regulation, even of the environment, and invade foreign countries).   For Stigtlitz it is about intellectual argument; if the Clinton people had been more convinced they were on the right side of the argument, they would not have cut the budget deficit so aggressively - and the US would now have more research and a better public infrastructure.   Maybe so, but Clinton was governing within a conservative maelstrom. My own view is that market fundamentalism has been shaped by the American conservative think tanks to dovetail so neatly with great American myths - individualism, the frontier, self-reliance, redemption through hard work, from log cabin to White House - that it has become a self-reinforcing ideological thought system that is impervious to rational argument of the type Krugman and Stiglitz marshall.   Appeals to liberty overwhelm arguments for government and fairness, because they appeal to the gut of middle America and the raw prejudices of working-class America. I've been told of country clubs still operating informal bans on membership of Jews and black people; and in the south and west of the country - the core of which is the old Confederacy - deplorable attitudes towards women, black people and even Darwinian accounts of human evolution lurk just below the surface. Market fundamentalism, coupled with calls for liberty, legitimise this cocktail of prejudice - and the fall of the Soviet Union gave the whole story renewed and urgent legitimacy which has not burnt out yet. The US is a very foreign country; and Stiglitz and Krugman, both East Coast intellectuals who think like Europeans, have yet to come to terms with just how foreign it is."
10,"Vision: The Lessons of the 20th Century for the 21st<br />by Bill Emmott<br />336pp, Allen Lane, £20 The editor of the Economist has been wrestling with what the future holds - on all our behalves. We can rest easy. There will, of course, be setbacks and alarms but essentially the future is good. America, which of course has its problems and difficulties, will underwrite and protect the advance of capitalism, which of course has its ups and downs too, but that twin combination of American hegemony and liberal capitalism that has served us well up to now (with, of course, some exceptions) will serve us well in the future - with possibly some downward interruptions to the upward march of progress. We can be paranoidly optimistic. Bill Emmott's crystal-ball gazing suffers from all the deformations of books of this type. He has no better idea of what the future holds than Gypsy Nell, and sometimes his honest recognition that the evidence which allows him to be sanguine could just as well work out very differently leaves the reader with an unsatisfactory sense of wading through acres of well-intentioned bullshit. On the one hand there are all these things that could go wrong; on the other hand they might not - usually because America and capitalism always win out in the end - so everything is ultimately for the best in this curate's egg of a world. Emmott might have written a more illuminating book if he had asked more interesting questions and applied more rigour in answering them. As he declares at the outset of his enterprise, he believes the two questions anybody curious about the world's future has to ask and answer are whether America will maintain the military and economic strength to champion peace and progress globally, through which capitalism flourishes; and whether capitalism itself is going to continue to deliver the goods. Anybody familiar with Emmott's leaders in the Economist will guess the conclusion to his questions - so this is a detective story with zero tension. Even those sympathetic to Emmott's case (and he will be surprised that I include myself, given his Manichean view of the universe about which, as a critic of present America and defender and advocate of contemporary Europe I plainly have little understanding) will feel very uncomfortable about his intellectual method. It is little more than a cook's tour of the world according to Emmott; the reader has little sense that the relevant literature has been surveyed or many primary sources talked to. In a typical passage he opines that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida are no more than representatives of a long tradition of terror (albeit on a more extensive scale) with no chance of capturing a state from which to operate. Confronted by focused American leadership they will finally be bested, although, to protect his flank, he adds that there must be no complacency. He may be right, but his judgment would have been a great deal more impressive had it been informed by an attempt to get behind what drives Islamist terrorism, some insight into the possible secret relationships between the terror networks and some Arab states and a recognition that American leadership by itself does not guarantee the outcome we all want - a lot depends on how legitimately and skilfully that leadership is exercised. Western security forces, to the extent we know much at all about what they think, seem much less optimistic than Emmott, and some scholars of Islam worry that its cultural predisposition towards jihad and terrorism is so embedded that not even liberal democracy - again a fanciful notion in some Arab states - could remove it. In any case 21st- century terrorism, based on networks without centres and on new technologies, may not need a state base from which to exercise enormous leverage. Emmott's opinion would have much more force were it backed by more substance than musings conceived in his Wiltshire study. On one aspect of this debate, though, he is wrong. The success of the US's confrontation with terrorism depends on the framework in which it is conducted. For Emmott, however, the crucial and over-riding question, given the way he frames his book, is simply whether America will engage and sustain its engagement. The hows of the engagement are second-order issues. Emmott thinks that multilateralism would be better than unilateralism, but that while the trend in the Bush administration towards unilateralism will create ""frictions"" it will not upset the ultimate prospects of success. This, a judgment also made by the American right, is woefully inadequate. The war in Iraq, if not triggered by a second UN resolution and with unambiguous evidence of a material Iraqi breach in its obligations, will not be legitimate - and will thus make any subsequent peace settlement difficult, if not impossible. Without international legitimacy, a successor Iraqi regime - the country is barely governable even by Saddam - will have little or no chance of long-term survival. The world's stock markets are correctly apprehensive that we are entering a new era of possibly prolonged instability, but the banal way Emmott casts his two questions and conducts his analysis throws little light on why this should be so. The right question is not whether America will engage with the world (that is inevitable), but rather what the balance of forces is within America that will determine the character of that engagement. Emmott, a largely uncritical British proselytiser of American conservatism, is indifferent to the way America is changing under the influence of the American right. It is not a drift to unilateralism; it is a headlong charge. At one point he acknowledges and regrets that America's insistence that it will not join the international criminal court undermines the international fight against terrorism. Yet he does not think to examine why such opposition is so deeply rooted - and, if anything, growing. Nor does it create ""frictions""; it undermines, as wise American commentators and analysts recognise if Emmott does not, the basis on which America can legitimately promote the peace and progress on which globalisation depends. There are two Americas: the liberal, internationalist one whose engagement with the world both Emmott and I regard as an imperative; and a highly conservative, nationalist and atavistic one that is insular, unilateralist and culturally xenophobic. That this is so, and the influence it has on the US's relationship with the rest of the world, does not change his conclusions; his ideological prism is such that America is in favour of free markets and democracy, and that is all that counts. By not marking or even understanding the fundamental divisions that are emerging in contemporary America, or acknowledging the debates about how capitalism can be configured, Emmott's analysis is rendered threadbare. He may, fair-mindedly, recognise that capitalism generates instability and inequality, but he has little time for alternative philosophies to the pure milk of free market economics that offer national communities social contracts and insist that enterprise be fairly run to embed countervailing forces. Essentially he buys the American conservative view that enterprise is about buying cheap and selling dear, motivated by a quest for lucre that should be uninhibited by regulatory constraint. Yet the building block of capitalism is the firm - a business organisation - and building and leading organisations that survive and prosper is much more sophisticated than the economics of the street market. As business leaders know, you need the active participation and support of a committed workforce to create a great business, and that in turn needs a sense of economic and social purpose other than simple profit maximisation; but the system built in America, in which workers are disposable commodities consecrated to the growth of shareholder value, makes that task harder rather than easier. The answer to the second question Emmott poses - about the sustainability of capitalism - would have been much more subtle had he thought to explore such notions, even if he disagrees with them. The American economic and social model has strengths, but to regard it as the model for the world to emulate, and all other models (notably those in Europe) as weaker because they deviate from the American model, is a grievous mistake. We need capitalism and globalisation to advance and prosper; and we need American participation in any global form of governance. To get there we will need better analysis and guidance than that offered by Gypsy Bill."
7,"All through her life Agatha Christie avoided the press, a secretive writer who hated interviews and never once agreed to appear on television. She saw no good reason why an inquisitive public should expect more from her than her books.  Born in Torquay in 1880, she lived until 1976, and died the best selling author in the English language, her sales still on the increase even now, standing at somewhere above four hundred million copies world-wide.  She came, as any reader of hers would guess, from a conventional middle class provincial background - that world or tea-parties, servants, tennis clubs, rectories, manor houses and public schools that dominates her books.  During the First World War she was a pharmacist in a local chemists, which gave her a working knowledge of poisons, but that hardly seems an explanation. All her life she had strong and powerful dreams, which Janet Morgan tentatively suggests may indicate the rich vein of fantasy in her character.  There were plenty of predecessors to her type of detective story writing - but after a few tentative beginnings, with fantasies and sentimental short stores, it was not long before she settled into this genre, for no apparent reason. She used to read her grandmother the crime stories out of the local paper, which may have aroused her interest. Certainly the morbid pre-occupations of her books seem to have had very little effect on the rest of her social life, for she was determined that her writing would always be of secondary importance to the living of her life, and the carrying out of her social wifely, and motherly duties.  She rapidly became highly professional in her approach mechanical in the working out of her plots and the manipulation of her characters, and dependent all her life on the money the books brought in.  The only really exciting event in her life was that astonishing disappearance, when half the Surrey countryside was scoured for her dead body after her car was found abandoned. The press were filled with reports of the hunt; some said it was a publicity-stunt (hardly likely in one who hated the press with such violence), others that she must suffer from amnesia, most that she had committed suicide.  The author gives a plausible account of a woman suffering a severe mental breakdown, partly amnesiac, due to her husband's announcement that he was leaving her for another woman. It was an episode that dogged the rest of her life.  The prolix 378 pages of this tome leave, not a stone unturned in the day to day doings of Mrs Christie; eighty-six years of bric-a-brac, people incidents houses, places, bills and interminable contract and copyright deals; and yet, oddly, the old lady herself has slipped away, vanished like Miss Marples.  Janet Morgan treats her subject with the kind of reverent academic respect that might be appropriate if Christie were a great simpler and not a much simpler phenomenon.  When the book needs is a dash of her own racy appeal, and a leap from fact into speculation about the nature of her astounding success, her readers, her world, and the attraction of her crime fantasies that have so little to do with real crime.  It is, however, an official biography, and at every page the heavy breath of a most protective family can be felt blowing upon Miss Morgan's neck as she writes, keeping her to a plethora of facts which sink the book like a tombstone."
7,"Bait and Switch: The Futile Pursuit of the Corporate Dream, by Barbara Ehrenreich (256pp, Granta, &pound;9.99)<br /> Rich Britain: The Rise and Rise of the New Super-wealthy, by Stewart Lansley (265pp, Politico's, &pound;18.99) How extraordinarily misleading economic statistics can be. Talk of ""average"" earnings or ""per capita"" wealth is virtually meaningless as a true description of a nation: if Bill Gates moved to Albania it would soar up the league tables without a single Albanian being a penny better off. This mendacity has never been more grotesque than in the US right now. The myth of America the thriving, booming, prospering envy of the world is most chillingly exposed in the writings of Barbara Ehrenreich. How she strips away the varnish to reveal the lives of the slaves toiling beneath the surface to prop up a curiously hollowed-out empire. In her most celebrated book, Nickel and Dimed, she took jobs among minimum wage workers, living in a caravan and a motel, failing to survive on $7 an hour. It left the British reader aghast at a far more brutal capitalism, redder in tooth and claw with no safety nets, no health care, no social security. Only charity food parcels stave off starvation for people doing America's essential work, sometimes two or three jobs at once in the richest nation the world has ever known. Now, Ehrenreich turns her razor-sharp reporting skills on the corporate world. She sets out with suit and briefcase to join business America, the offices of middle management to which most graduates aspire. Unfortunately she doesn't make the grade in the white collar world. As a reporter, this might have been a failed enterprise, a dead story. After all, she is not a good prospect. She is in her 50s, has never worked in business before and aspires to become a PR in the pharmaceutical sector. Even with a good deal of lying and friends to proffer references, frankly, it looks from the start like a doomed enterprise. By the end she concludes the only way she will get near the management suites is pushing a catering trolley. But Ehrenreich is the kind of reporter who could be put down just about anywhere and always come up with revelations and perceptions of the society around her, its people, their hopes and fears. So as she surfs the job boards on the net, rewrites her CV over and over, networks her way to follow every improbable lead towards the chance of a job, she finds herself down among the many fallers from corporate America. It is not just those who start out poor and uneducated who are destined to plunge into the abyss: it could be almost anyone. Downsizing after mergers, the arrival of a new manager or the constant cult of cuts keep managers on their toes. If they are ""let go"" and don't find another job fast, many, maybe most, are doomed to tumble down the social ladder. She meets them at expensive and futile networking conferences and motivational job search events. But a gap on a resum&eacute; - never called unemployed but ""in transition"" or ""consulting"" - is CV death. Most job applications receive no acknowledgment. From outside the office citadels become increasingly impregnable. Once hot personal contacts go cold, these fallers have no chance. But America the entrepreneurial has spotted a market here. These desperate people are preyed on by a whole industry of obnoxious (and themselves pretty desperate) career-coaches, ""professional mentors"" and trainers offering excruciating pop-psychology: reinvent yourself; smile. The psycho-babble of business spills into a kind of bullying, yet these frantic job-seekers shell out a fortune to receive it: it's their fault, their future is in their hands, there is nothing wrong the system, the only failings are all their own. Tragically, most sink into exactly the despair the career coaches say makes them unemployable. Many end up taking minimum wage jobs. Europe could do that tomorrow, if we abandoned social security to starve people into sub-subsistence jobs. The American dream is so powerful that even those living the nightmare still believe it. Ehrenreich often uncovers this depressing phenomenon in her rich portfolio of reporting America. She picks away at a brain-washed multitude clinging to a false idol. Without political leadership to suggest that the dream is all but dead and aspirational social mobility stuck in cement, the millions at the sharp end ignore the evidence of their own experience to believe still that anyone can make it. Those who don't are just failures. Only Ehrenreich's acid wit and caustic political intelligence makes this an enjoyable as well as a horrible read. But if you are in the mood for dark humourless mirth, then Rich Britain makes a good accompaniment. Stewart Lansley charts the progress of inequality at the top. The super rich are a new phenomenon whose fortunes took off in the 1980s and kept soaring. The late 70s were the most equal period Britain has ever known, a time when the onward march of social progress and fairer shares was taught in every classroom as if it were historical inevitability, from factory acts and boys up chimneys to universal education and health. What went wrong? This is a journalistic book, with more cuttings than original research, but it does the business. Well written and well analysed, it revolts and disgusts with tales of squalid greed at the top. All the statistics and the hard facts are there - how it happened, why it happened and how we are destined, unless someone stops it, to watch the pigs in the farmhouse continue to wallow in excess beyond the dreams of a Nero. The stratosphere of the boardrooms, where the likes of Lord Browne of BP now earn &pound;6.5m a year, has moved as far from the life of the average citizen as the addict in a blanket under Waterloo bridge. They no longer inhabit the same planet as the rest of us, hermetically sealed in smoke-windowed limo, private jet, private island, private everything. Yet they are more driven by the politics of envy than any mere socialist. They are driven on and on by that gross desire to be top dog, with top dollar, bigger bonuses than the boardroom next door, fatter jet and more richly bejewelled arm candy. Read this, keep it, store up some of its more pungent statistics and keep asking Labour what it's there for, if never to say enough is enough?"
0,"The Diana Chronicles by Tina Brown  496pp, Century, &pound;18.99 Luckily, perhaps, Princes William and Harry appear to have inherited their family's ancestral indifference to books. It is on the press and television that they focus, writing recently to Channel 4 to complain about the documentary Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel: ""a gross disrespect to their mother's memory"". Memories of Andrew Morton, with whom their mother had colluded, may also explain why similarly pained - if futile - rebukes are rarely levelled at literary scavengers. Asked by the princes' secretary ""if it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel, would we want the scene broadcast to the nation?"", a Channel 4 executive might reasonably have replied that his intrusions were as nothing compared with the rogue psychiatry and whiffy speculation that has become almost standard in books about Diana, including such classy additions to the genre as Tina Brown's The Diana Chronicles. In which we find the outgoing prime minister's exclusive reassessment (she taught us ""a new way to be British"") sharing the same capacious bucket as Brown's relentlessly smutty guesswork. ""To keep her company,"" Brown leers, ""there was always what she called 'Le Gaget', the tiny vibrator one of the staff bought for her in Paris as a joke."" Like most of the Chronicles, the existence of ""Le Gaget"" was previously advertised in a first-generation Diana book (Ken Wharfe, 2003), already rifled by Sarah Bradford for her authoritative 2006 biography, Diana. Contrary to the claims of novelty circulating before publication, Brown's solitary contribution to the archives appears to be the disclosure that the teenage Diana once behaved like a carnivorous Goldilocks, picking all the meat out of her employer's stew. For the rest, Brown's novelties are confined to changes of emphasis, and to speculation, none of it enough to modify Bradford's compassionate portrait of a dreadfully isolated young woman, whose problems - once you appreciated the misery caused by her mother's exit and her stepmother's equally sudden arrival, the ghastliness of her entire family, and the fact that she was only 20 when Charles and his fellow conspirators started telling her she was mad - seem far from being of her own making. Then why - if it wasn't for the &pound;1m reason - did Brown volunteer for this massive anniversary cuts job? She has nothing illuminating to add, and seems neither to have liked Diana nor to have found her all that interesting. At Tatler magazine, edited by Brown at the time of the royal engagement, the uneducated princess was apparently considered a pitifully naive ""sociological throwback"", impressing Tatlerites only with the ""tameness of her set"". There was ""no sign of Lady Diana Spencer or her ilk"", Brown emphasises, at a party once attended by her own, much faster circle. ""The definitive end-of-decade social event of the 70s was the riotously eclectic fancy dress party in Hampshire to celebrate the 40th birthday of Nicky Haslam, the fashionable decorator ... 'You can always tell a gentleman by the quality of his drugs,' an exuberant Lord Hesketh told me as we stood in line for the buffet."" Regrettably, Tina must break off here from her own, very promising, memoirs and return to translating Morton/Burrell/Jephson/Bradford into a racier dialect that renders lovers ""shag mates"" (""today's terminology"", she assures us), has Dodi's driver putting ""the pedal to the metal"", Charles preferring ""gags over shags"", and the effect of Diana's glamour on ""cafe society"" being to ""turbo charge"" it. Even the tragedy of Diana's later years evidently looks a little parochial, from Brown's demanding, transatlantic perspective. Maybe a sprinkle of Hollywood glamour? ""While the world was thrilling to the spectacle of Diana's life as a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical,"" she writes about Highgrove, ""her home life was becoming more like something out of Hitchcock. Under a King and I fa&ccedil;ade lurked a Rebecca-like sinister melodrama ... the shadow of Rebecca is never far away."" Just outside Chippenham, to be precise. For the benefit of American readers Brown includes a variety of topographical notes, possibly based on memory. ""Gloucestershire"", they learn, ""has a very wet climate."" For their part, English readers of this simultaneous translation are schooled in the significance of Diana's disco dance with John Travolta. Her arrival in Brown's world was ""an iconic moment ... There was a Hollywood dimension now to Diana's glittering fable of the shy girl who married a dashing prince."" Not for the first time, an iconic photograph would be a bonus. But there are no pictures in the Chronicles, even though images of the acutely self-conscious Diana are, as Brown affirms, key elements in her story: ""In an iconic photograph,"" she writes of the Diana-Hewitt polo trophy presentation, ""their eyes meet ..."" Presumably Brown requires this austere, picture-free eminence from which to pour scorn on lowlier chroniclers - ""the paps waited like hyenas"" - without being labelled a flesh-eater herself. As for Diana's wretched complicity with her snappers, Brown explains that her father's fondness for amateur photography meant that ""Diana grew up associating the camera with love"". At the same time, the girl was reading too much Barbara Cartland, ""leaving her spiritual bloodstream permanently polluted with saccharine"". A diagnosis that may be as accurate as any of Brown's other aper&ccedil;us: ""Gloucestershire people have to be one of two things - hunters or gardeners."" Perhaps she was away for Fred West. Largely on the basis of his charming appearance, our expert concludes that in William, Diana's ""legacy is in good hands"". Really? Even though William's father is a helpless whiner, his grandmother a grimly repressed survivor and his Windsor grandfather a bully? His mother was abandoned, for life, by her own, twice-divorced mother (who finally turned to the bottle), humiliated by the palace post-divorce, after which she endured only romantic disappointment before being violently killed, whereupon 15-year-old William's uncle provoked a blood feud with his grandmother, and his father resumed, with indecent haste, his courtship of the woman who had haunted and tormented Diana all her adult life - and has since made this shameless creature into William's stepmother. Interviewed last week, Prince William said he thought about his mother's death every day. It would be like something out of Philip Larkin, if only it wasn't true."
0,"The Naked Woman: A Study of the Female Body<br /> by Desmond Morris<br />  400pp, Cape, £17.99<br />  I wonder how many specimens Desmond Morris inspected before deciding that ""every woman has a beautiful body"", the statement which launches this book. Not enough, anyway, or he would surely have come across at least one that had gone wonky or started falling apart. He says our bodies are beautiful because they are ""the brilliant end-point of millions of years of evolution"". But you could say that about a slug.  Still, the admiration evinced throughout Morris's ""guided tour of the female body"" will make a nice change for women who have come to detest their unwieldy carcasses for not resembling the bodies of unusually thin pubescent girls, and fear the consequences should they ever stop attempting to disguise the general wear and tear that men find so nauseating in our sex. With a lack of restraint that verges, occasionally, on the reckless, Morris rhapsodises everything that takes his fancy. Most memorably, hair, which stirs reflections on men's ""quest for the softly flowing locks they dream of caressing"". Even a woman whose hair or face is nothing to boast about may well be in possession of a working back, highly commended as ""a brilliantly assembled set of muscle and bones with the twin functions of body support and spinal-cord protection"". Other humdrum body parts are special, he points out, in being superior to the male equivalent. Female hands are singled out for praise, having ""far greater finesse when it comes to the delicate handling of small objects"". And, on looking down, one finds that one's hands are, in fact, rather nicely designed. Thank you Desmond. If only more men had your respect for the precision grip.   It may seem a poor return for all these nice compliments, but beyond sharing his affection for body parts with which many of us are wearily familiar, it is not clear what Morris wants to say. Even his ardour occasionally grates. He does not consider the diseases that are apt to afflict the most brilliant end-point of evolution, nor does he notice the tedious, commonplace complaints that can leave the female body something less than beautiful. Feet, for instance, are all very well on the ends of our legs, but it seems pushing it, rather, to go on about how ""wonderfully they perform"", how uncomplainingly they ""effortlessly serve us and steer us through our changing environment"". Plainly, the man has never seen a bunion.   But perhaps seen-it-all adult women are not the ideal tourists for this particular trip. Perhaps, as with Morris's celebrated  The Naked Ape (1967),  The Naked Woman's natural audience is composed of inquisitive adolescent boys. It certainly has a very promising bottom on the cover; though even the most eager schoolboy may be disappointed by the amount of space devoted to things like ears, noses and cheeks - and all the other bits of standard female equipment that are not, give or take a few hairs, really so different from his own.   With breasts, bottoms and so forth, Morris is obviously on safer ground. If British sex education is in the sorry state indicated by our teenage pregnancy figures, then the more boys who learn the whereabouts of the U-spot and the elusive Anterior Fornix Erogenous Zone the better (a map or diagram would have been a bonus). The boys will also be intrigued - supposing it does not have a Ruskin-like effect on more delicate students - to discover the international variations in women's pubic hair. In the Far East, Morris discloses, ""the straight black head-hair is matched by pubic hair that has been described as 'black, short, straight and not thick but rather sparse ... forming a somewhat narrow triangle with apex upwards.'"" Young admirers of the Guinness Book of Records may also relish the many curious facts Morris has crammed into his appreciation. The merkin (pubic wig), inevitably, gets a look in. But did you know that there was once a French woman with ""no fewer than five pairs of fully lactating breasts""? Or that in 15th-century Venice a law was passed requiring prostitutes to expose their breasts? No notes substantiate such easily forgotten asides, but nonetheless: just fancy.   The Naked Woman abounds in these factoids; some interesting, some freakish, some dubious - many most amazing for the importance Morris attaches to them. We are familiar, of course, with the idea of cabinets of curiosities, collections of shells, bone, fossils. But one pictures this eminent zoologist with his Kinsey Report and Guinness Book of Records conveniently to hand, poring over sheafs of yellowed cuttings gathered over the years, carefully recording the fact that, in 2003, a woman with a tongue stud was struck by lightning in Corfu; or alighting on the story of another woman, in Connecticut, who attacked her unfaithful husband with her nails: ""The injured man required 24 stitches to close the wound in his scrotum.""   Not all Morris's anecdotes have been so laboriously collated. Once he has dealt, briskly enough, with the adaptive significance, physiology and function of a body part, most of his chapters rapidly decline into pages of loosely themed remarks that might look feeble if you found them in a child's project. Hairstyles, he notes, are not permanent.""When the hair grows out, new styles can be tried."" When it has grown, ""a ponytail can be a useful device to control untidy hair, both in the workplace and in the home."" Musing on breasts, he notes that ""the combination of 'bra and panties' remains with us to this day as the favoured form of female underwear"". A lined forehead is ""a telltale sign that its owner is no longer young"". And so, some might say, is a book like this."
0,"Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: The Official Autobiography by William Shawcross  1,000pp, Macmillan, £25 For the Queen Mother, writes William Shawcross, as he trudges through the second half of her life, ""one decade glided into another, with the basic pattern of her days, weeks, months and years being fairly constant"". For much of his biography he is remarkably persuasive on this point. Chapter after chapter of his interminable chronicle glides, or rather drags, repetitively past, allowing the few things that did change to stand out in lurid contrast. One year, for instance, she acquired a stairlift. But there must have been more to it than that. The Queen Mother was deeply in debt most of the time. And the arrival on the public stage of Prince Charles's mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, for example, must have caused a temporary wrinkle in the serene old lady's gin, nags'n'picnics routine. For grandmother and grandson were close. And considering her feelings about Wallis Simpson, who went to her grave unforgiven, and later about Peter Townsend, the Queen Mother must have had some views on the divorcee who saw off Diana. Concerning Wallis, she wrote at the height of the abdication crisis: ""If Mrs Simpson is not fit to be Queen, she is not fit to be the King's morganatic wife."" What, then, did she make of Charles's ambitious mistress? The woman features here only once, on page 795, identified as the wife of a royal guest, Andrew Parker Bowles: theirs is a joint entry in a 1970s Castle of Mey visitors' book. The author devotes far more space to the Queen Mother's lunches, to the decorations on her millions of hats, to her horses, to the various inert objects he spots then solemnly itemises, as if in training for the world championships of the tray game. Among the ornaments arranged on a Castle of Mey desk, he doggedly reports, is ""a little corgi from the Buckingham Palace gift shop"". It sits there now. The Queen Mother's house, Shawcross assures us, ""is preserved as it was in her lifetime"". He has chosen to do the same thing for her reputation. If it's hard to respect a biographer capable of an omission on the Camilla scale, it is impossible to trust him. What else has he left out? Shawcross records Princess Margaret's vandal decision to destroy letters from Diana to the Queen Mother because, she said, they were ""so private"". Given his determination to empathise, at all times, with the royal point of view, his comment on this affair may be read as savagely critical: ""It was understandable, although regrettable from a historical viewpoint."" From that perspective, this biographer appears to be at his most usefully unguarded in the first fifth of the Queen's 101 years. Possibly because it was long ago, Shawcross is willing to depict his heroine, during the first world war, as a giddy airhead gripped by her prodigious appetites for food, clubs, clothes, cocktails, dancing, chocs, actors, shopping and men in uniform, including chauffeurs. The nautical look had a particularly stimulating effect. Elizabeth Bowes Lyon was only 15 when she wrote a characteristically coarse letter to her governess: the Firth of Forth was heaving, she reported, with ""simply hundreds of beautiful brown lieutenants, subs, snotties (midshipmen), Admirals and sailors. Oh my! They were all most amorous!"" Not that she was unaware there was a war on. ""I feel as if I never want to go to a dance again,"" she wrote in 1918. ""One only makes friends and then they are killed."" Long before she would express her thankfulness at having been bombed, so as to look the East End in the face, the ill-educated Elizabeth complained bitterly at having had to travel to the same area, where she failed her school certificate. ""What was the use of toiling down to that  er  place Hackney?"" she demanded. But no sooner had this droll but frightful-sounding young woman accepted a proposal from the stammering Duke of York (having strung him along for a year or two), than such disagreeable sentiments were never heard again. Like her personality, the Queen Mother's epistolary style appears to have been transformed, on the instant of betrothal, into everything that is pious and dignified, sympathetic and charming. Unless we have Shawcross to thank for this unblemished characterisation of a boozy actress who more recently, according to the journalist Edward Stourton, said the EU would never work, because of ""all those Huns, wops and dagos"". In his diaries, her loyal friend the late Woodrow Wyatt recorded, with more tact ""She clearly has some reservations about Jews in her old-fashioned way"". ""I'm not as nice as you think,"" she used to tell him. Eleanor Roosevelt suspected something of the sort, noting Elizabeth's gift for ""turning on graciousness like water"". Shawcross, who is probably more queen motherly than the Queen Mother, will have none of it. ""She may have been a brilliant actress,"" he allows, ""but her feelings were genuine."" Really? It comes to something when a biographer's partiality is repeatedly exposed by the testimony of his own subject. Why can't poor women live on tea and ""some buns"", wondered this legendary trencherwoman, during the depression. In another letter, written after a bomb hit Buckingham Palace, we find her moved by a visit to the East End, where 200 people had died under a school. PS, she writes: ""Dear old BP is still standing and that is the main thing"". So we learned something, after all."
0,"The Autobiography of the Queen<br />by Emma Tennant <br />222pp, Bliss Books, &pound;9.99 The Uncommon Reader<br />by Alan Bennett <br />124pp, Profile, &pound;10.99 Even for the Queen, who is used to compliments, this has been a marvellous year for tributes. Vogue puts her in its list of the top 50 glamorous women. The Archbishop of Canterbury admires her ""creative faithfulness to a task"" (60 years of marriage). So does the poet laureate: ""the years stacked up"". Dame Helen Mirren professes herself ""a queenist"". And from the world of letters: two new royal fantasies, published within months of each other. Admittedly, she is made to look rather a fool in both; Bennett depicts the Queen as ignorant and thick-skinned (until she is redeemed by reading), and Tennant strips her of all dignity, but it seems unlikely either author would have gone to the trouble if the Queen did not continue, in reality, as unknowable and as uncontaminated by the world outside the palace as she was on the day of her coronation. Many less awe-inspiring, constitutionally marginalised monarchs probably dream of being lampooned by such high-class satirists. Like the Stephen Frears film in which the Queen is seen, with the help of Tony Blair and a passing stag, to surrender to the emotional literacy of the crowd, the novels show, in their way, that we care. Who would bother to show the Dutch royals learning to feel? They probably do little else. The Queen, Tennant has noticed, really does inhabit a world so remote that her sudden exposure to our own would lead to many a fascinating contrast. ""The Queen had never been shut out of a place before,"" she points out, after her version of the monarch is excluded from somewhere. ""Had she wished it, she could visit every stately home in Great Britain and be accorded the most rapturous and respectful welcome. High-security prisons, the inner enclosures at the most exclusive race courses, four-star restaurants with waiting lists of several years would all fling open their doors for her."" Wisely, perhaps, she makes no mention of Harrods. But Tennant could be right in thinking that the Queen does not know how to work anything, other than horses. And cars, perhaps, since she trained as mechanic in the war. We duly witness the Queen's struggle with her first-ever suitcase on wheels: plainly, Tennant believes her seclusion from the world to have been long enough to have rendered her a halfwit. ""'Does one simply pull it down the stairs?' she asked - but for once, there was no one there to reply."" The suitcase is needed because, for reasons too silly to go into, Tennant's Queen has decided to run away, secretly, to St Lucia, where she has bought a villa, off plan. It has not, oh dear, been built, allowing Tennant to devise all kinds of humiliations for an unappealing simpleton who has never learned to lock doors, look after her own things, or take any of the protective measures that would be adopted by the most insignificant of her millions of subjects. If this fable demonstrates, with relentless clarity, that the effect of a privileged royal life can be every bit as damaging, where life-skills are concerned, as a poor one, the glee with which Tennant swiftly reduces the Queen to a batty old fool in flip-flops is mystifying. Perhaps it is meant to be funny. One might well, if one were the Queen, prefer Bennett's fantasy, which features many welcome, courteously signposted jokes about Queens and queens, queens and smut, queens and class: ""good novels seldom came as well-connected as this"", his Queen concedes, confronted with a copy of Love in a Cold Climate. She is not just repressed and snobbish; Bennett's comedy also requires her to be so untutored, prior to befriending a well-read gay servant called Norman, that she can embark, with impartial interest, on biographies of Lauren Bacall and of Sylvia Plath - the first wife of her late poet laureate. ""That the Queen could readily switch from showbiz autobiography to the last days of a suicidal poet might seem both incongruous and wanting in perception,"" writes the kindly Bennett. ""But, certainly in her early days, to her all books were the same and, as with her subjects, she felt a duty to approach them without prejudice."" This simplicity enables the Queen, even after she finds ""a truly human side"" through her reading, to remain a useful idiot savant. All through, it is easier to imagine her talking in Bennett's Piglet voice, than in authentic Mirren. ""Books are wonderful, aren't they?"" she tells a lunch companion, let us call him Pooh. He agrees. ""At the risk of sounding like a piece of steak,"" she says, ""they tenderise one."" If this were true, literary people would surely be the wisest, loveliest people around. If only. Because the Queen is the Queen, no one in Bennett's story has the authority to challenge her epigrams about the transformative power of books with evidence of their regrettable limitations in this respect. If books stop a person being snobbish, for instance, what does one make of Virginia Woolf? And what is her position on bad books? We might know, if young Norman had recommended Mein Kampf, by a family friend. Or, for that matter, Emma Tennant's latest. Bennett's is such a divine little book, with its patterned end-papers and gold coronet, that it is sure to find its way, this Christmas, into the stockings of many reluctant readers, who may even, festive telly being what it is, discover that the intellectual's contempt for the non-reader has rarely been so seductively expressed. But they have only to emulate the Queen's evolution, following Norman/Bennett's course-work, into a lovely person and proficient literary tease to realise that The Uncommon Reader doubles as a charming, extended compliment to anyone with the same hobby.

0,"Mary Archer: For Richer, For Poorer<br /> by Margaret Crick<br /> 352pp, Simon &amp;amp;amp;amp; Schuster, &pound;17.99<br /> For some time now, Mary Archer's reputation has been on the whiffy side. If there was once, in the era of her fragrance, a possibility that this sanctimonious academic was quite as much a victim of her husband Jeffrey Archer's misdeeds as the prostitute Monica Coghlan and the many other people he has deceived, threatened or paid off, it has since been thoroughly extinguished by her subsequent adventures as an Anglia director, Lloyd's council member, merciless litigant and, above all, as champion of the Old Vicarage One. Anyone who can insist, as Mary Archer still does, that her husband did not deserve his prison sentence for the ""trivial"" crime of perverting justice is either dim or morally flawed, or, I suppose, in the pay of Jeffrey Archer. And the choirmistress Mary Archer is certainly not dim. Whiffiness, as Jeffrey Archer demonstrated for very many years, is no barrier to preferment, and his wife continues to prosper in public life. Although her work in solar energy is not, one gathers from Margaret Crick's biography, of a quality to put her in the first rank of scientists, Mrs Archer has nonetheless collected a number of prominent positions on boards and bodies, trusts and charities that would be quite amazing, were it not in the nature of such activities to be insupportably boring. Although it may be disagreeable for fellow worthies on, for instance, the board of Addenbrooke's NHS Trust, to endure sustained contact with a person who must be irreparably grubbied by her years as Jeffrey Archer's helpmeet, there is no evidence from Crick (who certainly looked hard for it) that the female Archer has been anything other than efficient and diligent in her public duties. And for all one knows, Lady Archer, who was heard not long ago hissing ""bitch"" at her former secretary in the high court, may, in this world of status-seeking busybodies, pass for a person of untrammelled integrity. What preoccupies Crick is her clever subject's loyalty to that buffoon, philanderer and fraud, Jeffrey. ""Does she know about everything and simply accept it? Does she excuse Jeffrey's unacceptable behaviour because she feels he has many redeeming features?"" Crick asks. ""Or is she a very strong wife who values loyalty and her marriage vows very highly?"" Would it really add to the sum of human knowledge if Mary told us the answer? Of course, Crick thinks so, worrying away at the question for well over 300 well-upholstered pages, until she is forced, in the final chapter, to admit that Mary remains ""an enigma ... largely because she stays married to Jeffrey"". In putting such emphasis on this mystery, Crick does herself a disservice, for her main achievement is to highlight, as never before, the similarities between the Archers. Mary may be a mistress of the periodic table who reeks of moral certitude, but she is also a flagrant exhibitionist who will grab any opportunity to warble and prance in front of an audience and who takes obvious delight in the attention and wealth, property and parties, geegaws and dressing-up opportunities that have been conferred on her through her husband's efforts. A career in solar energy does not buy country vicarages, penthouses and art collections. As with Cherie Blair, with whom she also has quite a bit in common, it is a habit of Archer's to alternate between showing off and asserting her right to privacy, and she seems to have gone to some trouble to thwart Crick in her research. While one fully understands Crick's irritation, Archer's resistance is also comprehensible. For there is, obviously, a good deal of difference between offering your own, disingenuous confessions and having them extracted from you willy-nilly by a third, probably unsympathetic party. Coming from the wife of Michael Crick, the author of a brilliant and brave expos&eacute; of Lord Archer's deceptions, Stranger than Fiction, this proposal for a companion volume was never likely to appeal to Mary Archer. Whichever came first, Margaret's antipathy, or Mary's obstructiveness, the result is a study in hostility. For example, Mary is semi-ridiculed for appearing in a new ""eyecatching designer outfit"", and then twitted for greeting Jeffrey, on his return from prison, in a dress ""at least six years old"". She is charged with having a face lift, then rebuked for wanting to keep it a secret. She is chastised for occasionally lashing out, and then criticised for not doing so more often. The snitty asides, sustained over so many pages, are not just monotonous, they also have the occasional, quite unintended effect of evoking sympathy. Whatever the couple's private sexual arrangements, for example, it seems unlikely that Jeffrey Archer's many infidelities were painless for his wife. Crick, perhaps working on the assumption that anyone married to Jeffrey Archer cannot have feelings, introduces the subject as follows: ""Unfortunately for Mary, one person certainly finding time to squeeze in a few extramarital affairs was the husband she liked so much."" With this level of disaffection, it must have been hell for Crick to complete what reads, for all her obvious research, like a protracted cuts job, supplemented with great chunks of Jeffreyana and lacings of Christmas round-robin detail (""guests enjoyed a menu of 'ham mousse and Newnham souffl&eacute;'""). Actually, the great enigma of this book is not the mysterious bond between Archer and Archer, but what, exactly, Crick ever thought she saw in Mary."
6,"Flat Earth News  by Nick Davies<br /> 
408pp, Chatto &amp; Windus, &pound;17.99 At one point in this vibrant tirade against the sins of modern journalism, Nick Davies ponders the possibility of a concerted Fleet Street plot to delude and traduce - then settles for something more mundane: ""The whole thing is much crazier than that. It is more like watching a mouse being thrown into a washing machine."" There's no conspiracy here, he laments, ""it's just a mess."" And that, ultimately, is the trouble with Flat Earth News, too. You can, both entertainingly and dismayingly, produce a formidable indictment sheet of bad things getting worse, debacles to make most journalists cringe - and he does. Too many chain papers slicing costs with share price survival in mind. Too much recycling of flimsy news copy across too many platforms. Too many corners cut, too much sloth and dishonesty; too many governments peddling lies; too many public relations merchants, whispering spooks, easy hand-outs, talentless celebrities, glib excuses. Too much damned time pressure demanding extra helpings of ""churnalism"" from ""the news factory"". And that's just for starters. If Davies were writing a book about parallel problems in British medicine, the first chapter would probably conjoin doctors Shipman and Crippen. His journey, as he professes at the start, may be all about truth, honesty and the ""profession"" he loves. But as we discover, soon afterwards, low blows and dodgy statistics are also a part of the business all journalists really belong to - which, from Thomas Nashe to William Hone to (well ...) Kelvin MacKenzie, is a trade, and a rough one, at that. Is there a theme to bind such horrors together? Davies believes that, once upon a time, the press enjoyed a golden age. He can't quite put a date to it: perhaps somewhere 1960-ish, when George Glenton of the News Chronicle wrote his crime correspondent's memoirs: perhaps the 70s when Harry Evans's Sunday Times was in full bloom: perhaps somewhere indeterminate before or between the twin devils of Murdoch and Maxwell. But in any case, things ain't what they used to be. Then (whenever then was) journalists had time to check agency copy, make their own calls, go out and order coffee; time to think. Now all that's gone to hell on a turbo-charged handcart. It's the constant swirl of 24/7 (as coincidentally recently denounced by Alastair Campbell in his Cudlipp lecture) that brings us down. Say one little word - McCann - and blush like Paxman talking pants. So, allegedly, Fleet Street manning, even on the Guardian, Times and Telegraph (Davies's prime targets), has sunk ""slightly below"" pre-Wapping levels, his research team from Cardiff University tell him, but the editorial space to be filled has swelled three times over. Result: rush, slop and reliance on Press Association copy (shrinking itself) that leaves only 12% of the tales you read here daily free from secondhand taint, thus dooming most reporters to double as mere rewrite toilers. But try crunching such numbers and indigestion follows. When I stopped editing this paper in 1995, the editorial staff was 260 or so. Today, on the most slimline reckoning (excluding internet-only staffing) it's 430. The Times has risen to about 450 over the past 10 years, adding 100 journalists. And when you look down at the Telegraph's vast new auditorium of a newsroom, you think of the Emirates Stadium. Fewer people? No: that's wrong. And more space to fill? Actually, the same Cardiff calculators claim that the Guardian only carries 20 UK stories a day, and the Times 24. From staffs of 400-plus, that doesn't sound exactly overstretched. The difficulty, alas, is that Davies hasn't done the basic investigative things here that distinguish his fine, award-garlanded work on education, health and poverty. Maybe he thought he didn't need to understand what makes journalism tick because, well, he was a journalist himself, wasn't he? But, in fact, he doesn't seem to comprehend the difference between the American and British newspaper markets, the change in commuting and demographic patterns that is bringing evening papers low, the impact of the net or the pressure on editors to make enough money to let brilliant correspondents (such as Davies) tackle one ripe subject at a time, at a leisurely, stone-turning pace. Did I, joining my first big regional paper in 1960, walk into a land of milk and honey? No: the first job there was cutting stories from the local morning paper and rewriting the first paragraph or two to fill up the local evening's earliest edition. (And the second job was writing a 950-word leader column before going through after tea and doing a full sub-editing shift). The ""golden age"" of Beaverbrook, union disputes stopping the presses, and regional mini-barons intervening to keep their Rotary Club chums out of the headlines? It is a dream and a confection. It is also chock-full of self-deception. Saint Nick begins with that ""defining value of honesty"". He hates the pack in full, brain-dead cry. He despises the facile cop-out of ""un-named sources"". But turn a few chapters further on, and Old Nick scatters page after page with quotes from anonymous chaps slagging off their editors or proprietors. The chapter on the Observer, which has caused a little churn of its own along Farringdon Road, is full of cop-out clauses - ""there are those in the office who believe that ..."" - and so notably short on attested fact that PA would bin it without a second thought. You can't escape the lordly contempt that Davies seems to feel for Roger Alton, the then editor of the Observer, and his political editor, Kamal Ahmed. And you can't miss the poison in the prose, either. What's it all about? Heaven knows. Davies doesn't agree with the Observer's leader line on Iraq, and nor do I as a matter of fact. But the mush of hindsight, No 10 briefings that might or might not have mattered and dissident CIA leakers two removes down the line aren't particularly compelling - and weird animuses keep poking through the skin of his prose like broken bones. He can't even tell when Alton is joking. This isn't the reporter as unbiased crusader, meticulously assembling his case. It's up close and personal. And what, for that matter, does Davies think of his Fleet Street investigative rivals? Barry Penrose is ""famously slippery"". ""Some"" think David Leppard of the Sunday Times a ""ruthless charlatan"". David Leigh, the doyen of this parish, has, like the typical reporter as described by Nick Tomalin, ""a plausible manner, a little literary ability and a rat-like cunning"". David Rose of the Observer, perhaps his closest competitor, is ""fatally open to manipulation"" because he ""has all of the self-confidence of great reporters but less of the judgment"". Goodness, how very unexpected ... From the Last Supper to a Private Eye lunch in 200 pages. Let's not kid ourselves, or anyone else, here. It would be utterly wrong to brush away all of the criticisms (and vituperation). The chapter on the supposed Bin Laden ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Iraq propaganda is terrific. So is the section that deals unsparingly with bugging, tapping and monstrous hypocrisy. There's bags of useful material to cut out and keep, plenty of reasons to pause for thought and hang heads in shame. But, rather too quickly, the tone grows shrill and devoid of humour. My sources, right: everyone else's, wrong. It is a mix that leaves too much out (just like those Daily Mail ""exclusives"" he despises so much). ""I am taking a snapshot of a cancer,"" he says grandiosely at the close. ""But I fear the illness is terminal."" Well, perhaps ... though the final, unthinking quote from Joseph Pulitzer reminds us that Rupert Murdoch is a meek little angel compared to that wild man of the New York World - and that grumpy old golden ageists need to keep their history books close by. One inescapable point about journalism is that, base or lofty, ruthless or idealistic, it is a mess, and always has been. That shouldn't stop us from trying to clean it up point by point, problem by problem. We can't afford not to be serious about our serious trade. But nor - like rather too many tremulous tradesmen - should we wallow in a froth of self-loathing that blots out the good and the necessary and the essential, too. Put that damned mouse back in the washing machine and get back to work, 24/7."
6,"Who Runs Britain? by Robert Peston  Hodder &amp; Stoughton £20, pp360 The title question is rhetorical, without a definitive answer. Apparently, Gordon Brown doesn't run Britain. Like Tony Blair before him, he truckles to the global super-rich. His bizarre New Labour rule is 'that if you don't want to pay tax, be impoverished or obscenely wealthy,' Peston notes sourly. But do a few globetrotting billionaires really make us, and our elected leaders, dance like puppets on some golden string? Not in ways you can quite pin down. Their main threat, the one that gets Downing Street oddly anxious, is that they'll push off to some other fiscal heaven and leave us in the lurch, which would be unpleasant if they paid their full tax whack in the first place. But they don't. Peston doesn't do angry. His BBC business editor berth, not to mention all those calm years on the Financial Times, keeps wrath well under wraps. But as he surveys a City landscape of hedge funds, private-equity capitalists and cheap cash stacked tower-block high, he wonders whatever became of the dour son of the manse who frowned over greed and railed against avarice. Under 10 years of Brown's stewardship, 'the maximum spoils have gone to those at the very apex of the income and wealth league tables; a new plutocracy has been born'. Why? Heaven alone knows. And now, as the rivers of cash start to run dry, that mystery will surely be probed time and again. The best sections in this fluent, incredibly up-to-the-minute look at Britain in the first months of 2008, don't explore theories of extremes and extremely depressing consequences, though. Peston, in relaxed, conversational style, is a great teaching and travelling companion along the highways of finance. Can't tell your private-equity gambit from your hedge-fund finagle? Unsure what happened to the pension upon which you were relying? Here's the clearest, most erudite explanation around. And it's all so damned easy to pull off, money for jam when the banks take the strain, because they're too dumb to do due risk diligence, and when the Treasury gets every intervention wrong, because it seems to have become terminally stupid. Want to build more hospitals and schools? No: we taxpayers effectively subsidise Debenhams or the AA as they jump through private equity's hoops to the tune of many lost tax millions, then, for years, reward the suits who put the deals together with a 10 per cent capital gains windfall. But, in its middle reaches, you can feel Peston's loyalties wandering. He ought to be putting the boot into Damon Buffini, the chairman of Permira, Britain's only 'world-class' private-equity company, but Buffini is black, with a single mum, born on a Midlands council estate, an Arsenal fan and he's too interesting to be a cypher for hate. Like Ronnie Cohen, founder of Apax and creator of businesses in Palestinian territories, he is a three-dimensional character. Whereupon, in the constant company of Philip Green, Stuart Rose of M&amp;S and Allan Leighton, we move into chapters full of pulsating tales in which the super-rich earn their corn by being smarter, shrewder and quicker off the mark than the rest of us. In short, Peston finds himself beached somewhere between condemnation and admiration. If Philip Green of BHS and Topshop ran Britain, we'd have some fabulous parties and great tales to tell. At which point you begin to ask the next, more intriguing question: how much does super wealth matter? Peston believes that a Britain divided between hugely rich and pretty poor, between equity-intensive London and public-service North, is a country that may come apart at the seams. The bingeing of the hedge-fund few brings us 'overpriced art and control of a football club' - but nothing of worth or cohesion. New Labour's legacy may be a land where billions in lost taxes also means lost hope and opportunity. Yet - golly! - it's all very fascinating while it lasts, he seems to mutter round the side. And where, politically, is the resentment of fantastic riches dubiously accumulated? Do Chelsea fans wave their fists at Abramovich - or Ashley Cole (netting more in a week than Derek Conway's expenses for a year)? Does anyone but the Daily Mail care how much Jonathan Ross takes home? Is anybody but Amanda Platell volunteering to knit cashmere socks by the guillotine? No. Like America, we seem to have bought the whole celebrity culture package. We gawp admiringly at the rich and famous. We switch on TV lists of 'the world's top billionaire heiresses'. We aren't into rage or envy. We inhabit a landscape where income gaps don't seem to matter any more. We are almost certainly wrong, fuelling our own demise. But the case for truly caring - for concern about who should run Britain - needs to be made afresh, with passion. Peston has only begun a great, engaging job here. He's started; now he must finish."
6,"The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America by Hugh Wilford  Harvard University Press £18.95, pp342 It was a small, West Coast magazine and a very big scoop. Much of American public life, Ramparts reported some 41 years ago, had become a front for the Central Intelligence Agency. The United States and the world beyond it were littered with subsidised, sham organisations that all played the same mighty anthem when Frank Wisner and his successors at the Office for Policy Co-Ordination pressed a button. Trade unions, campuses, artists, Catholics, women, Hollywood tycoons, journalists ... they all danced to a spymaster's tune. Whereupon the New York Times and other mainstream papers joined in the expos&eacute; and the Wurlitzer short-circuited. Within a few months, the entire apparatus of propaganda deception had imploded. Two deep questions - one explicit, the other elusively implicit - arise from Hugh Wilford's elegantly written, diligently researched examination of the CIA's glory days. First, and quite unexpectedly: how did Allen Dulles's 'company' control the instruments of deception it had built? Second, and still more unexpectedly: did any of it add up to more than a little penny whistling? Readers of Wilford's first essay in this area (The CIA, the British Left and the Cold War) will know that the history professor from Long Beach University trades in cool judgment, not tub thumping. He's a master of context and nuance. He finds no house room for overarching theories. Thus, the luminaries who did the agency's bidding did not, for the most part, have to be browbeaten into collaboration. Like Joe Alsop, the syndicated newspaper columnist, and his brother Stewart, they were true believers to begin with. They bought the thesis first eloquently outlined by the great guru of postwar diplomacy, George Kennan. They saw the USSR as a dangerous adversary steeped in dirty trickery and phoney associations designed to delude gullible liberals. They didn't get mad, though; they just played the same game. They were joiners and participants by natural inclination; they thought it their duty to chip in and help Uncle Sam (which also meant helping many of their old university and country club pals). This wasn't, in short, some close-knit, top-down conspiracy, but rather positive patriotism as practised by concerned citizens. It concealed no guilty secrets nor, in their eyes, amounted to doing anything wrong. Gloria Steinem, for one, never thought about apologising when her membership came to light. 'In my experience, the agency was completely different from its image; it was liberal, non-violent and honourable,' she said. And, since that was the case, there was scant inclination to treat orders as orders. If you were a bigwig in the unions who didn't like being told what to do, you damned well argued back. Front organisations for democratic dialogue and disjointed debate? Not exactly, but there was nothing subservient or overtly sinister here. And then Ramparts changed everything or, perhaps, picked up on the changes that the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam had brought. Suddenly, it was rather harder to sort the good guys from the bad guys and reverence for the CIA had turned to edgy anxiety. The fronts began to seethe with the debate that had once been their recruiting strength. Wisner's successor at the OPC, Tom Braden, who had by this point left the CIA, blew much of the gaffe himself with an astonishing series of revelations in the Saturday Evening Post. Perhaps the agency had seen the writing on the wall and was engineering its own destruction? In any case, the Wurlitzer was turned into scrap metal within months of what one official historian described as 'one of the worst operational catastrophes in CIA history'. At this point, many of the witting cowered in chastened wrath and most of the unwitting who had worked alongside them wallowed in furious denunciation. Right-wing organisations railed at the CIA for funding left-wing fronts, not them. Newspapers like the New York Times, even though it had had a secret agreement with the agency to employ at least 10 agents as reporters or clerks in its foreign bureaux, assumed irate attack mode. Shame and loathing replaced patriotic pride in a trice. The whole enterprise folded back to front and those elusive questions of power and reality became inescapable. The trouble with secret agencies is that they're never open to evaluation. We're stuck with taking them - and paying for them - on terms they dictate. The Wurlitzer must be mighty because they tell us so. But then it's spook nonsense as usual. Plant a man in Paramount Studios and get him to censor a gag about manhandling Muslim women from a Jerry Lewis-Dean Martin farce because it threatened 'potentially disastrous results in the Muslim world'. Back an unwitting Halas and Batchelor to make Animal Farm because Orwell really socks it to the Reds, doesn't he? Write a memo noting that 'women are now a very important factor in nation-building' and fund a committee of women to plan over coffee mornings. Fund directors who want more money and artists who'll do anything for money. Burn fingers time and again on the Partisan Review, then do the same on Encounter, The evidence covers a swirl of constant, exhausting activity, but, significantly when you look hard, it does not demonstrate much in the way of hearts and minds massively moved. To the contrary, as Kennan wanly concluded at the end, stuff of this kind 'is not in the nature' of America. The fronts that Wisner built were more errors than terrors, shrill tunes on that tin whistle - which Hugh Wilford plays with sentient skill."
6,"More Time for Politics: Diaries 2001-2007 by Tony Benn  Hutchinson £20, pp400 It's a Saturday morning in 2002 and Tony Benn's phone rings. Michael Foot is hacked off because Benn's sold his last volume of diaries to the Mail. 'Well, at least I didn't go to Australia at the expense of Rupert Murdoch,' our hero rasps back. 'Boy, was he angry! And I thought, bloody hell, that man joined in the witch-hunt of the left with the full support of all the right-wing papers ...' When, months later, Benn goes to Foot's big birthday party, he marks his old leader's encroaching age with something near relish. 'He was sitting all the time. His head was shaking about, as it does. He highlighted his support for the war in Yugoslavia, which I thought strange. But still, he is 90.' All of which serves as a useful reminder of bad times a quarter of a century past when brotherhood in the Labour party seemed best defined as a pilot episode for The Sopranos and the man formerly known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn was hate-figure-in-chief, reviled for shredding the last vestiges of unity before Mrs Thatcher swept them away. He's morphed into something quite different now: he gives 'big hugs' to Natasha Kaplinsky, Saffron Burrows and sundry visitors who become friends. He's chummy with Cherie. He's full of the ailments and snoozes of incipient exhaustion, but these make him appear a softer, more vulnerable fellow: earnest, eloquent, principled because these days he never need compromise. He grieves most movingly for the love of his life who died before him. The widower stays in the same big Notting Hill house, surrounded by the clobber of a long, happy marriage and struggling with a leaking roof. But he still sets himself an infernal pace: four books a year, newspaper columns, TV shows, platform speech after speech. He does rehearsed impromptu on nightly demand, long before David Cameron thought of it. He travels Britain relentlessly, a driven man who fears that the music might stop. You may glimpse Benn with puffing pipe hanging out of train windows from Crewe to Cornwall. And if there's nothing much doing on the travel front, then his chum Speaker Martin has given him a free pass to the Palace of Westminster, so he can sit in the Peers' Gallery or the Commons tea room and feel that, after 50 years, the most wonderful working men's club in London still looks after honorary life members. Are these diaries, like the six books before them, entirely honest? Of course not or, at least, not exactly. His loathing for Tony Blair fills page after page. Blair's a dictator, an autocrat. He reduced national executive meetings to farce and cabinet meetings to 20 minutes. Yet when the hated one offers Benn's son, Hilary, repeated promotions, there's scant hint of gratitude or reappraisal. Indeed, Hilary is given an easy ride on the principles front. He's allowed to say what he likes about Iraq or anything else without a word of paternal remonstration, because he's doing what's necessary and Dad is touchingly proud of his achievements. But such understanding never extends beyond the family circle. It is almost as though winning elections time after time were some mortal sin, as though the compromises needed for any change stick in a gullet of unrelenting hostility. It is a compelling, often rollicking read. And some of the points, like his passionate fears for the carnage of war in Iraq, are savagely well-argued. He didn't waft off to see Saddam on some kind of ego trip. He went because he thought he might help stop something terrible and when Saddam told him that there were no weapons of mass destruction, who now can say that he lied? Events and amazing energy have kept him going beyond the point 'where your main function is to do obituaries of people you know'. Against all odds, he's the nearest thing British politics has to a national treasure. But always keep your defences handy when he ventures too near. Most of the hostility of 25 years ago is clearly pointless and gone. His affection for his family - and theirs for him - speaks of a humanity his old enemies never acknowledged. Yet you can't fill a year's diary entries, let alone 50 years' worth, by just being 'nice'. Tony Benn was a player; he remains a player; and if you saw him popping up on TV the other day, wondering if he could stand for Parliament again at 82, you know he'll carry on playing until the day somebody else has to write the obituaries. Big hugs, but eyes wide open, too."
6,"The Bin Ladens: The Story of a Family and its Fortune  by Steve Coll  Allen Lane £25, pp671 There is a contradiction here. Without Osama, and what he did, this family history would surely never have been written. What western publishing house cares about the growing pains of a Middle East civil engineering corporation? Yet the story of Mohamed bin Laden, his heirs and successors, is enthralling. It does not explain 9/11, nor al-Qaeda, but it explains a great deal about the tentacles that run from Riyadh to touch a wider world, tentacles of corruption, ambition, hedonism and dislocation. In a curious way, it is essentially American. A century ago, a Yemeni peasant farmer borrowed an ox to plough his patch. But the ox died and its owner wanted restitution, so the farmer had to flee miles from his homeland. He married, began to raise a family, then died, leaving two sons, Mohamed and Abdullah. Mohamed, the elder, found work on building sites. He was skilled, organised, meticulous. People trusted and promoted him; in the Thirties, he founded his own company, where one thing went with another. One thing was the house of Saud and its ruler, Abdul Aziz. The other was oil. Great gushers of cash poured from beneath the desert. Abdul Aziz was an absolute monarch determined to build temples, roads, palaces. So he called for Mohamed bin Laden, the master builder. It was a classic saga in the American style, of impoverished immigrants turned into millionaires. At the end of this tale it's 13 September 2001. America is stunned and vengeful. The name Bin Laden seems like a curse. Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador in Washington, hires a Boeing 727 to thread its way across the States, picking up the Bin Laden family - students, entrepreneurs, lawyers, wives, kids - to get them to Saudi before they come to harm. Osama may have declared war on the States, but his kith and kin love the place. They don't want to go. The US is their home. In between the death of the ox and the death of belief in a peaceful, post-communist world, the royal family and the family that does its building move in parallel. Abdul Aziz is a holy man and unholy fornicator. By 1930, he claimed 235 or so wives, married and divorced four at a time. He aimed to extend his power by procreation and thus keep it in the family. Mohamed bin Laden was the same. He managed 22 wives and 53 children. In 1957 alone, the year Osama was born, by way of a fleeting marriage to a 15-year-old Syrian girl, he was the father of six other children, two daughters and four more sons. So pause here for a moment: what kind of true 'family life' does such compulsive copulation produce? It may be habit-forming from generation to generation: Osama has racked up at least five wives and 22 kids. But what does it do to the psyche? Dynastically, more means more - more chance that one out of scores of sons will be capable of carrying the business forward. Thus, when Mohamed dies in a plane crash, his son Salem has been educated well enough at a minor English boarding school to take charge. He 'believes in his Learjet, his MU-2 and his jeans and guitar and harmonica,' says a Lebanese chum. The empire grows, the routes to homes in Florida are open wide. The Bin Ladens are global before Salem dies young, in another plane crash. But here's brother Bakr, more prudent, more concerned about image, a talent to take the helm. For as long as the House of Saud survives, there is money and booze and a wife in every port, with the American ambassador dancing attendance and the Bush family laying out a Kennebunkport welcome mat. It's a heady ride and a racy read in Harold Robbins mode. This is how Saudi Arabia was built and these are the foundations it rests on. No wonder Salem began to move millions overseas when the House of Saud rocked. No wonder that today, under Bakr's stewardship, the Bin Laden brand has a global reach, into jeans as well as bricks and mortar. But does even Steve Coll, a shrewd Washington Post journalist, understand how Osama bin Laden emerged from this brew? Only mistily, perhaps. Osama was part of the family business, too. Salem left him $9m or so. He was family bagman and House of Saud middle man in Peshawar as the Afghan war against the Soviets gathered momentum. He was a good fundraiser with charisma and contacts. Yet how did that relatively minor family apparatchik turn into a monster of destruction? You can trace his zealotry back to the gym master from the Muslim Brotherhood who taught him in Jeddah. You can sense the alienation of the excluded. You can also discern the restlessness of midlife crisis as he develops his creed and targets the Americans who underpin his family and wealth. But he's not much of an intellectual; he's not a guerrilla fighter in the badlands of west Pakistan now; he seems lonely and somewhat bemused. Osama bin Laden is the cuckoo who fell out of a nest of gold lined with mink. If you want to know what comes next, look back to Saudi Arabia and ask yourself how long can this state endure? The enemies of our enemy can be intrinsic enemies, too."
4,"Flat Earth News  by Nick Davies  Chatto &amp; Windus £17.99, pp320 Dog does not eat dog. This, as Nick Davies says, is an old Fleet Street convention. His latest book is 'a brazen attempt to break that rule'. It is a task that Davies more than fulfils, swallowing the leash and kennel for good measure. His diet sheet includes the British newspaper industry, its regulators and the PR machine that supplies it. Davies's title defines what he sees as lies, distortions and propaganda, all accepted without question. High-minded journalists tend to dislike their grubby trade much more than bankers hate banking, say, or teachers teaching. They also have better platforms. Davies is an award-winning Guardian reporter with a distinguished record in investigative journalism. There are few more qualified dog-eaters around. Davies unmuzzled deplores the rise of 'churnalism'; the quick-turnover dross peddled by hacks less scrupulous or fortunate than him. Costs are being cut and standards eroded by greedy proprietors. Hidden persuaders are manipulating truth. At its worst, the modern newsroom is a place of bungs and bribes, whose occupants forage illicitly for scoops in databases and dustbins. Newspapers hold others to account while hushing up their own unsavoury methods. Self-regulation does not always offer fair (or any) redress to citizens who have had lies written about them. Stories are often pompous, biased or plain wrong. Some close scrutiny is not only legitimate: it is overdue. Much of Davies's analysis is fair, meticulously researched and fascinating, if gloomy. Contrary to what he implies, though at least some regional papers are excellent at fostering young talent. Nor is his paean to 'old-style reporting' convincing to anyone recalling how traditional Fleet Street hands were frequently befuddled by incompetence or drink or both. It seems elitist, too, that Davies has chiefly confined his study to upmarket papers because 'nobody needs a book to tell them that tabloids are an unreliable source of information about the world'. Why then, one wonders, do newspapers like Davies's borrow so many of their stories from the red-top press? Still, these are minor worries. The main obstacle Davies faces is that any self-appointed guardian of truth must be above reproach. Of course, as he allows, he will make some errors, especially in a book as ambitious as this. But any occupant of the moral ground must meet his own high standards. Does Davies? The test lies in his three concluding chapters on specific newspapers. The first concerns the Sunday Times and the lapses of its Insight team under Andrew Neil. The third, entitled 'Mail Aggression', asserts that the paper scaremongers on immigration and that the editor, Paul Dacre, is prone to shout rude words at his staff. The first charge is correct, in my view, and the second so much-repeated that it is probably true. Davies is wrong, however, to suggest that the Mail's investigation of Stephen Lawrence's murder, a campaign of courage and commitment, was purely based on the rumour that Stephen's father had once done some work on Dacre's house. In the section analysing Dacre's character, an unnamed employee alleges that he has 'the biggest office in the universe; you sink into the shagpile; he's got a desk like Napoleon'. I am no expert on Napoleonic workstations, but I can confirm that Dacre's desk appears normal and his carpet, last time I looked, had cropped tufts. These are tiny quibbles, but such misleading details convey a false impression of vulgar opulence. The most controversial chapter, however, is devoted to this newspaper. Davies focuses chiefly on the run-up to the Iraq war, which The Observer supported, so enraging many liberal readers as well, no doubt, as staff on its sister title and Davies's employer, the Guardian. He is especially scathing of the former editor, Roger Alton, and its executive news editor, Kamal Ahmed. Both recently left the paper, as did I. I agree with Davies that The Observer should not have backed the war and that it took its views too often and too unquestioningly from Downing Street. But other accusations are, at the least, debatable and in some cases wrong. To imply that Alton tried to delay or block a story that the US had planned to bug UN Security Council members is simply untrue. The leak, supplied by whistleblower Katharine Gunn, was one of the paper's finest scoops and the senior executives most involved in the story say that Alton 'behaved impeccably'. Nor is it true that six executives blew their chance, at a leader conference held in Alton's absence, to swing the paper away from backing war. Several of the group, of whom I was one, had tried for many weeks to do exactly that. We had not persuaded Alton that Blair's adventure had no basis in justice, nor cover in law. No doubt that was our collective failure. But editorial lines are decided by the editor, not by committee. There was not a hope in hell that The Observer's position could have been reversed that day against Alton's wish. The more disturbing aspects of his attack revolve round human detail. Ahmed, for example, is damned for uttering several remarks that, if he ever made them, were offered in jest. The starker criticism is reserved for Alton, who is painted as a blunderer, too naive or airheaded to grasp politics. Almost all of Alton's staff would attest to his sly, dry wit, his acute political sense, his humour and his ability to sustain the pretence that he understood less than everyone else in the room while actually knowing much more. Balance is always difficult in such a passionately argued book as this. Thus, while Davies is careful to point out that not all journalists are lazy, credulous or bent, the exceptions go largely unexplored. The Observer, he concedes, was not subject to 'Stalinist censorship', but there is scant mention of the myriad anti-war news stories or the columns, of which, in my experience, Alton never sought to change a word or soften an attack on his editorial line. The many voices of protest included Observer columnists Henry Porter, Avi Shlaim and former weapons inspector Scott Ritter, whose contributions ensured that readers were not, as Davies says, 'soaked in disinformation'. Which is presumably why, livid as many were, they kept on reading. Many of Davies's arguments are powerful and timely, if unduly pessimistic. British papers, for all their faults, have much left to commend them. But yes, their grasp on truth and honesty is sometimes frail, which makes Davies's exposure of murky practices both welcome and important. The puzzle is why a dispassionate investigation of a flawed trade gets so personal. It is a pity, because the sound that lingers is not a call for truth. It is the bone-crunch of dog devouring dog."
4,"Blair Unbound<br />by Anthony Seldon with Peter Snowdon and Daniel Collings<br />(Simon &amp; Schuster) £25, pp704 He's back. Just when Tony Blair has disappeared, as if vaporised, from the domestic political stage, here is the reminder of how completely he once filled it. The second volume of Anthony Seldon's biography is unstinting in its detail of the Blair tenure in the years after the Twin Towers fell. This is an account in which no banana goes uneaten (Blair makes 'short work' of a piece of fruit while watching the first footage of 9/11), nor any night's sleep disturbed ('absolutely diabolical' turbulence on the way to Japan) without the scrupulous attention of Seldon and his hundreds of sources. It is also, as we are reminded often, a tale of love. Tony loves Cherie. As one friend remarks: 'They are as much in love, and their relationship is as fresh, as the day they met.' And that's despite the Bristol flats imbroglio, the 'stresses' on the marriage and Leo, aged four, waking his exhausted father by creeping into the parental bed. Tony also loves Gordon, which is much more curious. As someone says: 'Underpinning all the noise about Gordon is Tony's highly complicated love for him.' It seems little short of miraculous that this bond survived Blair's ordeal of being roughed up by a brace of Eds (Balls and Miliband) and yelled at by Brown: 'When are you going to F off and give me a date? I want your job now.' The Downing Street genre of love story, as full of romance as a feuding chimpanzee colony, could be termed Mills &amp; Baboon. If affection seems in short supply, then the style is oddly reminiscent of a bodice ripper. Partly that is down to the daunting task of marshalling such a wealth of information. Three hundred interviews, comprising well over a million transcribed words, suggest a formidable exercise in production line efficiency and packaging. In less skilful hands than Seldon's, this could have been Tescolit. Blair's fondness for banal dialogue does not help. 'God, it is awful, this war business,' he remarks at one point. None the less, the result is a fascinating overview, not least for its even-handedness. This is as fair a judgment on a Prime Minister as you are going to get, especially so soon after his departure. Seldon, unlike his subject, has no wish to pre-empt or dictate history. His mission is to record events, not to assess how they will come to be seen. Inevitably, much familiar ground gets retrodden, but Seldon has also uncovered good stories. Even allowing for the axe-grinders settling old scores, there is convincing new material, especially on the Blair/Brown feud. In one set of meetings, convened to smooth out feuds, the Eds 'began to be astonishingly rude to the Prime Minister'. Miliband, once the 'white hope' of No 10, began to be written off, according to one source, as 'irretrievably lost to the forces of darkness and anti-reform'. In the face of such quasi-satanic opposition from his foes, Blair complained: 'I feel like an abused and bullied wife.' This culture of institutional thuggery at the heart of government casts, the reader might think, a whole new light on Blair's anti-yob crusade. The 'Respect' agenda, far from being a device for criminalising Britain's youth, might simply have been a battered PM's coded cry for help. The highlights of Seldon's book are often the cameo parts. Robin Cook, told to vacate the Foreign Office, sits with his head in hands and a brandy at his side, repeating to himself: 'What shall I do? What shall I do? Tony has sacked me.' Jack Straw goes 'quite white' at the first suggestions by British diplomats that America was ready to go to war on Iraq. Tony hosts a 'girls' night' in the flat at No 10, during which Tessa Jowell and Margaret McDonagh deplore his pretence not to know how to work the dishwasher. 'More seriously, they chided him over Lebanon.' Often, the Whitehall-speak of Seldon's sources, coupled with the strangeness of Westminster life, blurs the trivial and the world-changing: a Gleneagles banquet menu (lamb, aubergine caviar and parmesan polenta) seems hardly less dramatic than the evidence from Abu Ghraib. British reaction to the images of torture should not, Blair warns, 'go over the top'. Strip away the meticulous detail and this biography has two subjects: Blair and Brown. Their long and almost unrelenting battle for primacy is played out along the lines of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Brown glowers, rages, sulks, plots and devises every scheme imaginable to hasten the end of Blair, an adversary who frequently seems cornered and defeated but who bounces rubberishly back from each new blow. Neither character quite transcends stereotype. There is little evidence of the 'love' that binds them and even less of the more affable face of Brown. Yet Blair seems far from the hero of a story that lays out all the flawed thinking that led to the Iraq catastrophe. Having backed to the hilt a disastrous conflict, he never pushed George W Bush hard enough on postwar planning. The notion that a better strategy would have guaranteed a good ending is a fantasy indulged in by the war's supporters. Even so, there was a possibility, never taken, of mitigating some of the grimmest consequences. If Blair felt pain or remorse over Iraq, there is little sign of it, beyond the sub-Shakespearean soliloquy in which he declares himself ready to 'meet his maker', at a time when many British service personnel, not to mention Iraqi citizens, were meeting theirs. As the cares of Downing Street finally bear down on him, he cries: 'Am I ever going to be free of all this stuff?' Now he is. This account of the Blair era, so soon after its end, is likely to be the fullest for many years. It is a solid foundation stone for history. Even so, it does not quite answer the question: who is Tony Blair? No one could have cast a wider net than Seldon and yet his subject, elusive as ever, somehow slithers through its mesh."
1,"Founding Brothers   Joseph J Ellis  299pp, Faber, £12.99  <br />   Englishness took time to drain from the generation that made the United States of America. One of the most radical of those men, John Adams, wanted President George Washington to be addressed as ""His Majesty"" or ""His Highness"". Though Adams was ridiculed in turn as ""His Rotundity"", early Americans remained infused with British cultural habits even as they fought to shed British political control. This was the earliest version of the special relationship. We now think of American independence as foreordained, but its makers were not sure they could achieve it. There had never in the history of the world been a republic that encompassed territory so large as the quarter-continent the US aspired to be in 1787. Rome and Sparta, yes; America, surely not.  Achieving it required a combination of remarkable men, poised between their ambition for independence, their uncertainty about what that might mean, and their constant, swirling debate, in the 13 separate colonies in which they lived, about how it might be done. This argument, about the power of the centre as against the rights of regions, has never ended. ""The   debate was not resolved so much as built into the fabric of our national identity,"" Joseph Ellis writes. One might extend that to the world at large. A kind of modernity is always to be found in the history of the American revolution, and certainly in this short, engrossing, brilliantly coloured account of the men who made it.   Ellis chooses the eight whom he regards as the most remarkable, asserting with old-fashioned clarity, against the grain of modern historians' prejudices, that here was an event that depended on great men rather than on social forces or the life of the street. Four of the central players, Washington and Adams, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, were rivals and yet collaborators; sometimes soldiers, sometimes intellectuals, who shaped the political institutions that, more than 200 years later, remain the basis of the country that became the most powerful on earth.   We meet these characters through a series of stories that weave, from anecdotal beginnings, a diverse account of the theory and practice of nation-building. The famous duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr becomes a set piece not only of forensic professorial inquiry but of the argument at the heart of all constitution-making. The feelings as well as the ideologies of very serious men - and women, through the spikily candid presence of Abigail Adams -   in dispute and yet in fraternity, present a complex tableau. I had not previously understood the case for saying that Washington was perhaps the wisest of them: the one who had never been to Europe, yet counselled most firmly for European peace; the one who crucially insisted on retiring after his second term. ""If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world,"" a disbelieving George III is credited with saying.   This was a decisive moment. The US proved that it would indeed be different from the Great Britain whose vanities and corruptions it sought to avoid, and hence build a new world. For all their flirtation with majesty, these men were essentially anti-British; that was the point of what they did. Their story reminds one of what recent vintage is the intimacy that has brought our two countries together on the killing fields of Afghanistan. Thomas Jefferson, a loather of the class system, was consumed by Anglophobia. ""I wish that misfortune and adversity could soften the temper and humiliate the insolence of John Bull."" ""Britain will never be our friend, till we are her master,"" Adams opined, with prophetic insight into future cohorts of poodle prime ministers.   The cultural connection, of course, remained. In the early days of America, there was no other inheritance to draw on. The   genealogical lines were also copiously linked, though it is worth remembering that by 1900 there were reckoned to be about the same number of Americans of German origin as of English: 18m against 20m. But few will read this history of the founding fathers without being reminded how much of myth is invested in the notion that the English-speaking peoples are especially and uniquely Anglo-American.   A different kind of myth connects the founding of America with the supposed impossibility of creating an integrated Europa. To suggest that Jacques Delors is no James Madison is entirely to miss the point. For in the obvious sense, the virgin lands of Tennessee and points west offered a possibility of federation that cannot conceivably apply to the gnarled old nation-states of a continent populated and civilised for two millennia. Washington and his heroic generation engaged on a task that is simply not available for Paris and London and Berlin.   On the other hand, its experimental nature - the fact that many believed it could not be done - re-echoes today. The experiment is different, and the outcome will not be a new country. But the challenge is as formidable, and the debates of the 18th century have their application in the 21st. There has never been a more enduring constitutional work, composed by    men of business not academe, than  The  Federalist Papers, written by Madison, Hamilton and John Jay.   Ellis's account is rich in knowledge lightly worn, a work of deep scholarship successfully masquerading as popular history. It penetrates many questions that resound today, from America's origins as a nation bent on having ""no entangling alliances"" to the insidious devices by which even this generation of leaders, unique in their creativity and endurance, for the most part avoided addressing the corrosive issue of slavery -which, within a few decades, almost blew their creation apart.   The book speaks to a nation that is becoming ever more absorbed by its own history, even as its solitary reach extends around the world. One could speculate on the connection between the afterburn of 9/11 and America's new absorption with the heroic past. David McCullough's recent biography of John Adams sold 1m hardback copies. Ellis's has done almost as well, and won the Pulitzer Prize. In these days of trouble, it speaks to Europe with the same compelling interest."
9,"Chance Witness<br />by Matthew Parris<br />528pp, Viking, £18.99 I've known Matthew Parris pretty well for nearly 10 years, and he has always been kind and helpful and thoughtful, with only the occasional whiff of cattiness carried faintly on the breeze. He is also very kind about me in this alarmingly good book, so you might want to discount what follows. The cover shows Matthew with his hand over his mouth, as if he had just let slip a dangerous indiscretion. Yet I've read few autobiographies that are so carefully considered, so empty of anything glib or cheap. The only damaging material is about people who are already dead, or who are big enough to take it. (Among the many wonderful vignettes of Margaret Thatcher is one illustrating her reliance on the Sun, and in particular the two-bullet-point editorials that used to appear opposite page three. ""One day she plonked the paper down in front of the assembled male company, open at this spread, and said 'what do you think of those two, eh?' No man present dared catch another's eye."") The book also made me laugh out loud several times. Parris is savage about the late and little lamented Dr Sir Alan Glyn, a Tory bore whom even the bores avoided. The descriptions of him eating langoustines, shell and all (""I remember especially the feelers poking through his moustache and waving wildly as his yellowed teeth chomped the heads""), and of the time the wardrobe fell over door side down with Dr Glyn inside are alone almost worth the price of the book. If the unexamined life is not worth living, then Matthew's life has paid for itself several times. He learns from almost everything - his boyhood in Africa, his homosexuality, his work with Mrs Thatcher, his time as an MP, his disastrous stint on Weekend World, subsequent huge success as a journalist, and the inexplicable decision to spend four winter months on an almost uninhabited island near the Antarctic circle. There is the occasional infelicity, such as his description of the one time he had sex with a woman (""it could have been a goat as far as I was concerned"") but far more perfectly expressed truths that illuminate and inform. My favourite is this: ""Being an MP feeds your vanity and starves your self-respect."" This is a book full of wisdom and if we are invited along the way to share Matthew's many triumphs, why not? Is he expected to leave them out? I had vaguely thought of writing my own autobiography at some stage, though my plan was to exclude myself almost entirely, since readers might be entertained by some of the events and people I have encountered, even if they had no interest in me. Having read this book I realise what a silly idea that is. Matthew has done much more than me, and thought about it all much more deeply. I was reminded of the Peanuts cartoon in which Linus and Charlie Brown are lying down looking at clouds. Charlie Brown asks Linus what he can see, and he replies (something like), ""I see a map of Prince Edward Island and a profile of the composer Aaron Copland. What do you see, Charlie Brown?"" ""I was going to say a horsey and a cat, but I don't think I'll bother now."" Nor me."
11,"Okay, here's the story - there's a widow, a very pretty widow, with four very pretty children. She locks said children in an attic. They grow up, and the oldest two do the nasty, even though they are siblings. Well, come on, they're in an attic! What would you do for fun, teach yourself Latin? The reason they're in the attic is because the house belongs to their grandfather, who won't acknowledge the existence of the children because of their shameful beginnings - they were sired, you see, by the late half-uncle of the pretty widow. As it turns out, though, their father was both their mother's half-uncle and her half-brother, the product of a brutal rape (by the grandfather, of his step-mother), which wasn't strictly speaking incestuous (the rape, that is), and certainly wasn't incest compared with what happened later, but was still very wrong. So, back to the attic children who have just had sex - they are both the spawn of sibling incest and engaged in sibling incest. Oh, and the widow has decided to poison them with arsenic, which makes them very pale, but still extremely attractive to one another. They realise their peril and escape, with one younger sibling (the other has died). They lead a full and unhappy life of mistreatment and suchlike.  A rogue doctor has an affair with the girl sibling - it results in a pregnancy, he performs a quick DIY abortion and keeps the foetus in a jar on his desk for a laugh. In the end, the siblings marry at the age of about 50 - they pretend they are unrelated, of course. No good comes of it. I'd estimate that anyone born after 1970, who ever came into possession of breasts or a sister, will know what I'm talking about. We are in the land of Virginia Andrews (originally known as VC Andrews) and her Flowers In The Attic quintet (aka, The Dollanganger Series). She completed three other books besides this series - My Sweet Audrina, and the opening two of the Casteel quintet - before her death from breast cancer in 1986. She is still making the bestseller lists in 2001, with new novels, which is not as spooky as it sounds. Shortly before she died, Andrews mentioned, in the one interview she gave, that she had the plots in place for 63 further novels. It was no great surprise, therefore, when Garden Of Shadows, the prequel to Flowers In The Attic, was published posthumously. Then came the third book in the Casteel series, which is again attributed to Andrews.  At this point, briefly, the Andrews estate claimed that there were many more completed manuscripts, so readers could look forward to a steady stream of fresh gems from the dead writer. This was not the case - in fact, it had brought in a ghostwriter, Andrew Neiderman, who shared an agent with Virginia Andrews and furthermore had taught in high school for 23 years, so had a good idea of her teenage-girl constituency. The estate came clean about the existence of a ghostwriter in an open letter in 1987, explaining that it had chosen a gifted author to ""organise and complete Virginia's stories and to expand upon them by creating additional novels inspired by her wonderful storytelling genius"". It did not mention him by name, and it was six years before anyone discovered Neiderman's identity (he also writes under his own name - most famously, Devil's Advocate, which was turned into a lame film in 1997).  Since 1986, Neiderman has completed the Casteel series, and written six more - The Logan Family, The Cutler Family, The Hudson Family, Landry Family, Orphans and Wildflowers - most of them containing five individual novels. Readers are undeterred by the change in author - judging from the web fanzine, they generally can't tell the difference (or, as one joyfully put it, ""I can't believe these books! Every one is so good, you think it's better than the one you just read! I'm going to collect them all, so that when I have children I can present them with the full set!"").  Kate Lyall-Grant, from the English arm of publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, says, ""As far as I'm concerned, it's pretty much an open secret that the real Virginia is no longer with us."" The dust-jacket biography, however, says, ""Virginia Andrews is a worldwide bestselling author. Her novels have sold more than 80 million copies and have been translated into 22 languages.""  It makes no mention of her productivity being in any way muted by death.  Virginia's ""storytelling genius"" rarely detours from the incest theme. Indeed, her first published work was a short story entitled I Slept With My Uncle On My Wedding Night. (There were, apparently, decades' worth of short stories, which were never unearthed. If only those secret texts were found - you could probably discover a whole series, comprising I Slept With My Father On Prom Night, and I Jerked Off My Brother Just Before I Had A Bath).  What makes her books so strange, however, is not the incest itself but Andrews's oddly wholesome, home-baked way of writing about it. Don't get her wrong - she never comes out in favour of incest, but she does tend to present it as human error, rather than, say, grotesque trauma. Her writing is, frankly, bizarre - if you had to read a sentence out loud, you'd choke on the words (""Golly-gee, but it was a beautiful day! If only we were allowed out, rather than having to sit in this musty old attic and starve to death!""). Paragraphs about the complexities of adolescent sexuality and brother-love might start with the phrase ""Dolly-day!"" (""However shall we erase the stain of our evil behaviour? Oh, but it seemed so right!""). It's like reading a court transcript of the Brady Bunch describing a decade of orgiastic abuse. This led to a ban on Andrews's books in many American schools, which still applies in some of them to this day. One critic at the Washington Post said Flowers In The Attic was the worst book he had ever read. The sales, though, were extraordinary - the unknown author made the bestseller lists within two weeks of publication. Petals On The Wind, the second in the series, stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for 19 weeks. My Sweet Audrina trumped them all, making number one on the New York Times list just three days after its publication. By the time of her death, Andrews had combined sales of 24m, and had been named Number One Bestselling Author of popular horror and occult paperbacks by the American Booksellers Association, beating Stephen King. Neiderman is a different kind of creature altogether, although he is manifestly keeping within Virginia's girls' own fiction remit - if the heroines are not ballerinas, they're actresses, and they usually have a pony to turn to. They have frequently been orphaned tragically young. His style, though, is storytelling at its most functional - no ""Golly-lolly, did it steal my breath away!"" here. Packed, in the traditional way, with terrible events and curiously bad behaviour, his books nevertheless have none of the odd crepuscular feel of the real Virginia, whose determined clinging to the bright details of childhood - dolls' houses, matching tutus and slippers - felt unwitting rather than deliberate. Neiderman does not have Andrews's unfailing best-seller record, either, but he has shifted 50m books over his lifetime, so could hardly be called a dud. His 30th novel as Virginia, Eye Of The Storm, came out last month. There is no doubt that he still works from the novel plans left by Andrews, but that he has leeway to insert modern details, such as the internet. This latest trilogy features a heroine named Rain - there she is, happy-ish in her deprived Brooklyn home, when she discovers she was adopted. ""I always knew there had to be a reason why I felt what I felt for you,"" says her brother (I paraphrased slightly), who turned out not to be her brother. ""Let's get married!"" But no, that can't be, not until Rain's real brother, who doesn't yet know of the blood connection, has also proposed. Then he dies and Rain becomes disabled by a horse incident - incest, or even the thought of it, exacts a heavy price, as ever. And yet you can't blame the kids - the Virginia world is not one in which regular people who don't share your blood ever just tip up and see if there are any other bodily fluids you fancy sharing. Apart from a mini-series about some unrelated girls (Jade, Misty, Star and Cat), every group of books features at least one incestuous couple, and usually there are two. Where this fixation comes from is unclear. Virginia Andrews did have a pretty rotten life - in 1939, at the age of 16, she was paralysed in a freak stairs accident, and lived with her mother for the rest of her life. She started writing at 25, after the death of her father. However, there's no evidence of incest within her family, although there are rumours of one finished novel that she wouldn't publish because it was too autobiographical and was, she thought, too damaging to her relatives. Considering that even small sneezes she did during her lifetime seem to have found their way, via Neiderman, into print, that's somewhat unusual. What her books suggest more strongly is not that she encountered incestuous relationships, but rather that she suffered from an arrested development, which bound her for ever into the concerns of the early adolescent. The novels have the core ingredients of a Judy annual, which give them the safe glow of childhood - an orphan wants to be a ballerina; adults around her behave outlandishly badly; she, nevertheless, keeps her beauty; a peer sustains her spirit throughout the maltreatment, and, presto, 15 years of untold abuse later, there she is on stage with a tutu on her trunk and a song in her heart. Small moments from the tail-end of childhood - the breakage of a favourite musical box, the pleasure of eating a doughnut - have peculiar prominence. And yet, at the same time, she delves into the deepest reaches of adult depravity and societal aberration. You couldn't find a more exact formula for teens if it were done by computer, with a built-in Teetering On The Brink Of Womanhood template. Even if you couldn't feel in your gut that these books are aimed at a specific readership window (11-15, I'd say), you could tell from the reader reviews. There are thousands pasted on the net, and, generally speaking, they take a book-critic clich&eacute; and give it a charming angst-wracked spin. ""I just couldn't put this down. Not that I had a reason to. I didn't have anything else to do.""  The reviews are a million times more touching, and more speechful, than the books have ever been.  ""Normally, I can't wait for books to end. I didn't feel like that at all,"" said one homework-beset individual. ""I would hate to be locked in an attic,"" said another, evoking that terrible blurry time when everything you see or read or hear seems as real as everything else. A child's desire to apply real solutions to fictional scenarios sneaks into the quasi-adult chat - ""Well, if I was the grandmother, I would never have allowed Corrine to come back to Foxworth Hall. Instead I would have paid off all her bills, and made her and the children live in a small apartment while she trained to be a secretary.""  The readers rarely mention the incest, which is odd, considering it's the sine qua non of the oeuvre. When they do, they are very forgiving - ""I know that the incest parts are kind of weird but in a way it's interesting, even though it would be very sick in everyday life. But I could not blame Cathy and Chris for doing what they did."" If people rarely mention the dirty stuff, there is a reason for that - these books share with fairy tales the role of addressing the most absurdly transgressive notions, in order that the more subtle psychological nasties giving rise to them needn't be scrutinised.  It's classic pre-Freudian feverishness, coming out a good half-century after Freud. Virginia Andrews is basically a Gothic novelist, and much closer to her 19th-century forebears than a self-aware, exploratory, progressive Goth-merchant such as Angela Carter. Andrews's tools are the old classics - secret rooms within the larger castle to equate with the danger of the ""inner space"" within the body; characters who basically seek a pre-adolescent love along brother-sister lines (as they do in Frankenstein and, oh, loads of others), only to find that they've accidentally slipped into the realms of untold depravity.  The feminist critic Edith Birkhead maintains that as fairy tales are necessary for children, so Gothic novels should be the next stage in our development as adolescents. This was said in reference to 19th-century fiction, when no one ever expected to deal with their sexuality beyond actually having sex now and again, when taboos were everywhere and when more prosaic teen fiction such as Judy Blume, which gave you the nuts and bolts of making out with boys, had not yet been invented. As it turns out, even now, with the broad array of frank and open discussion aimed at the inchoate sexual soul, people still have a yen to see the business rendered as a truly disastrous, irredeemable, abhorrent act. It's hard to say how much longer the current Virginia Andrews can keep it up - and what will happen when he tires of his ludicrous contortions to find new ambitions for the quintessential girl (ice-skater? Tennis ace? Model? How many opportunities can a girl find for a short skirt fashioned of net?). There are another 30 plots left of the first Virginia's literary estate. Can he face it? If not, can a new head grow out of the bloodied stump of his literary career? How much almost-but-not-quite incest can the next generation take before they go back to Wuthering Heights? Will anyone ever match up to the quagmire that was the original Virginia's imagination? And if they can, won't they want to do it under their own name (it would seem a waste not to)? Well, obviously there will always be a Virginia - there's been a Virginia-shaped hole in the market since about 1890, when people started uncovering their table legs and everyone thought the great repression was over. And it was - but this incest business runs deeper than we thought everyone thought the great repression was over. And it was - but this incest business runs deeper than we thought."
11,"Jonathan Franzen is what you might call a tricky bugger. He is very hard to read. He can be puckish, but you can't rely on the mischief. He looks a bit like Monty out of Withnail and I must have, before fat got him. Now 47, he dresses like a trendy don. Loud noises pain him absurdly. He is all rufty-tufty in conversation but socially incredibly thoughtful and worried about causing offence. When he refuses a coffee from a waitress, he follows up frantically with about 17 different reasons: I've already had one. Your coffee's delicious! I'm allergic to coffee. I am already taking coffee intravenously, under the table I have a coffee drip ... The Corrections, the book that won Franzen America's National Book Award in 2001, put him immediately on to the global authorial A-list. A couple of notable things surround it, besides the great worth of the book itself, which has already been remarked upon by everyone - certainly that I have ever heard - who has read it. He refused to endorse his book's appearance on Oprah Winfrey's book club, a very public spat at the time, which gave him a reputation for wanting to be highbrow, possibly for wanting to be more highbrow than he was. It was a notion compounded by the fact that The Corrections was his third novel, his first success after two works - Twenty-Seventh City and Strong Motion - whose reach perhaps exceeds their grasp. And now he has written a memoir, The Discomfort Zone: A Personal History, an extract of which appears in Review tomorrow. I suppose the danger is that it might be taken as an appendix to The Corrections, broadly, as a portrait of family dynamics, and more intricately about a father's Parkinson's disease and old age, and duty and recklessness, and was taken to be, if not autobiographical, nevertheless pretty close to home. The Discomfort Zone does nothing so obvious as sift out the fact from the artistic licence. He picks up episodes of his 1960s childhood - the time he spent loving Snoopy; the spelling bee he almost won but in the end drew, the semi-but-not-exactly Christian youth group that shaped his social persona - and buffs them to a high shine, refracts the rest of his life through them, realises their importance but also presents them as curiosities and doesn't make a great self-aggrandising deal out of them. I say I think memoir was an interesting genre to choose when he was at the crest of a fiction wave. ""But that's why I chose it,"" he says, laconically. ""I was on the crest of the fiction wave."" But he also says: ""I think one reason this book felt alive in the last few years is that I was extremely disoriented by my change in fortune, and it is a book about a feeling that I've lost the values of my youth. What I discovered in the process of writing it is that those values are not as clear-cut as I initially supposed. But still, it was elegiac in conception if not in final form."" Generally speaking, its reception has been warm, though, of course, those aren't the reviews that have stuck with him. Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times's chief reviewer, absolutely hated it. ""In the US,"" says Franzen, neutrally, ""I seem to have tapped into a certain amount of hostility to me personally, so in hindsight it seems riskier than it actually felt when I was writing. In the hands of a particularly tone deaf and humourless reviewer [he is talking about Kakutani], my humble or self-satirising admissions come across as the declarations of a depraved person. I believe I was called a jackass. And the word self-absorbed was used as a pejorative. Unlike all those other, unself-absorbed writers."" He is smiling his way through this, but it has definitely pissed him off. ""I didn't see any of that coming, and it seemed to me that if you good-humouredly relate the story of your various failures, who could be mean about that? I've already been mean about myself."" ""It's a strategy,"" I say. ""Yes."" There is a long pause. I believe what he is about to extract is bathos. ""But it turned out not to be very successful."" I am amazed that he should be piqued by the review, even though I know nobody is immune to criticism - in his writing, he is prepared to leave himself totally vulnerable, in a way that you could only do if you were really self-aware. I still think he is self-aware, but I was wrong to think that makes him bulletproof. That morning, before I met him, Franzen was on Radio 4's Start the Week (with Craig Brown - there was a funny mix) and he said he had a love-hate relationship with America. I ask him to expand on that a little. ""Expand how?"" he says. Well, what does he love about it? ""Why are you interested in knowing that?"" Christ, I don't know . . . in the long run, I want to know where he stands politically. There is a section in The Discomfort Zone about Hurricane Katrina in which he allies himself unambiguously with the US left-wing and yet I don't think that allegiance could be taken as a given from the rest of the book, particularly his heartfelt and voluble affection for Webster Groves, the suburb of St Louis, Missouri, in which he grew up, the third son of a railroad manager and a homemaker. America seems very polarised, politically, and it would be interesting to hear whether that is true, or just seems like it from the outside, and if it is true, how he has managed to avoid it. All that doesn't come out in a neat nugget, though, not from me, anyway. Conversely, ideas issue from him in a complete and stylish state. He has a disconcerting habit of thinking before he speaks, and I suppose that is what comes of it. We get to politics eventually, when I posit that he is insufficiently liberal for the liberals and insufficiently reactionary for the conservatives. ""That's the story of my life. I'm insufficiently elitist for the self-important, and I'm insufficiently populist for the Oprah-philes. I'm not bad enough to be bad and I'm not good enough to be good. I wasn't east enough to be east, I wasn't west enough to be west. That really is the story of my life. And when I was young, it all made sense because the middle seemed like a good place to be. That's the point of the book. The happy time when I didn't have to choose sides. Politically in particular, but culturally as well, you have to choose sides in the United States. It's a rabidly divided country, and it makes me miserable because both sides are wrong. Don't they know it? You don't make many friends that way, though. What you end up with for friends are the people who enjoy reading books. Which is fine - that's what I want. But it's not a very large group."" I don't know about east and west, but I have always thought that Franzen fell between two stools in terms of the American literary scene, which consists on one side of very traditional storytellers, with a possibly highly complicated but nevertheless old-fashioned sense of narrative (John Irving, Anne Tyler, Garrison Keillor); and on the other side, the experimental writers (David Means, David Foster Wallace, George Saunders, Chris Bachelder), who are avant-garde, not as a pose, but because the innovation is the engine of the whole train. Franzen simply doesn't fit into either group - he is not defined by being experimental, I doubt you would even describe him as such at all. But nor is he a John Irving for our times. ""I'm very flattered. Can you enrich the compliment by unpacking it a little?"" (He does this a few times, assumes a compliment where there wasn't necessarily one. Distracted by something earlier, he returns to the conversation with ""Sorry, you were just about to say something nice about me . . ."" when I really wasn't. I still don't know if this is a mind game, or whether he just has rose-tinted hearing.) Let's clear this up, he says, George Saunders is not heavy-handed, he would be so amused to think that was how he was described. Oh, Philip Roth is, why didn't you just say that in the first place? Those two writers are nothing like each other! John Irving wrote the most political novel - The Cider House Rules is really the most intensely political novel, Garrison Keillor is a liberal spokesperson now, he hasn't been neutral since he was on the radio . . . I didn't really mean political, I mean concerned with formal experimentation. ""I have no interest in avant-garde pretensions. Which is very, very different from saying I have no interest in serious literature. Pretension is the word - simply because I declare myself to be difficult, I am therefore worthy of extraordinary status and attention. ""That would have been a strange concept to Kafka, I think. His methods were not a style, they were not an attitude. They were written in his own blood. It's very easy to pick up an avant-garde attitude - it's very hard to write anything that's good, anything that really matters. And I think a lot of the most intensely emotional stuff, the most deeply engaged stuff being produced in the United States is writing you would consider avant-garde or experimental. They are all formally wacky."" Does he feel a part of that? Socially, yes. David Foster Wallace and David Means are his best friends. In terms of his work, I still don't know. He got pretty aerated without actually telling me. ""I don't mean to be sounding defensive. I fear that I've already laid down on magnetic tape some quite defensive statements."" ""You do sound a bit defensive,"" I say. ""I'm not. I'm just asking you to help me to understand . . . We've gotten off on to nomenclatorial issues. We should get back to something having to do, perhaps, with the book in question."" He has quite a lot of verbal flourish - I wouldn't call him mannered but I can imagine, when the time comes for Philip Seymour Hoffman to play him in the biopic, that his friends will be lining up with funny (affectionate, experimental) impressions. I think the book is a bit self-flagellating - charmingly so, but all the same. As he describes his broken marriage, for instance, something that in reality he must have some grievances about, it sounds like yet another instance of a rather sticky situation coming about through his loveable wrongness. Well, you can kind of see why he would be sensitive to the feelings of his ex-wife, Valerie Cornell, a novelist herself (yet when you look her up on a search engine, the first thing that comes up is a footnote on Franzen's college alumni profile. Infuriating.). Sorry, back to the flagellation. ""I felt like I was making fun of myself. But that feels like a different thing to flagellating myself. Perhaps in England those two things are indistinguishable. A lot of what I'm writing about, if not important, is at least painful. Early on, I got a very anguished letter from the mother of the little boy who dies in chapter two. Not complaining, simply reporting that it was extraordinarily painful to see her story - which was the story of a mother losing two sons in the space of two years; another son of hers died of cancer, I believe - become a small part of my story. ""When you do non-fiction, you have to be aware of that. I'm joking about stuff that was painful to me and painful to them. I managed to make a comedy of errors out of a marriage that was extremely important and also extremely painful ultimately. Again, a memoirist would be well-advised to tread carefully, don't you think?"" His parents are no longer living but don't his brothers mind all this revelation? ""One of them does. This other brother said, several times, I hope you're not going to do too much more of this. But they are good brothers. There was never any likelihood that I was going to be excommunicated by the family. They're grown up, their lives don't revolve around me."" He thinks for a minute. ""I present evidence of their lack of rage as a form of character witness on my behalf. If I were a jerk, they would be mad at me""."
