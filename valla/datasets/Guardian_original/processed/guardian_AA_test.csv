3,"If the great history lesson of the 20th century is that socialism does not work then the watershed event in that tragic enlightenment was the one that took place in Moscow 50 years ago this month - the so-called ""secret speech"" delivered by Nikita Khrushchev to a closed session of the 20th congress of the Soviet Communist party on February 25 1956, in which he mounted a devastating attack on Joseph Stalin, then not quite three years dead.I write this with complete intellectual confidence but also with some journalistic trepidation. Part of me feels the need almost to apologise for writing today about an event from the now-distant past, which for many readers is likely to seem as unrelated to their own lives as the Council of Trent or the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi. Moreover, as someone raised in the British communist world, whose first memory of any public event is of the death of Stalin himself and who was surprised at the age of five to find that my infant-school teacher had never heard of Harry Pollitt, I am anxious not to disappear into historical anorakland and lose the many readers fortunate enough not to be similarly steeped in the bliss, brutality and betrayal of the revolutionary movement.Yet the secret speech has shaped all of our lives, whoever we are and whether we realise it or not, most obviously because it led eventually to the collapse of the Soviet system, the end of the cold war, and the triumph of the west of which we are all today living if still sometimes conflicted witnesses; but less obviously because it posed questions about public intellectual and political honesty that remain just as undodgeable today as they were in 1956.Given his own history, Khrushchev's speech was an act of great moral bravery and huge political recklessness. Speaking for nearly four hours, he stunned his listeners with a detailed and sweeping account of Stalin's mass arrests, deportations, torture and executions. Though the delegates were sworn to secrecy (and the speech remained unpublished in the USSR until 1988), the details soon leaked out, both in briefings to Soviet and satellite parties and, possibly at Khrushchev's own instigation, to the western media, including via John Rettie of Reuters, later of the Guardian.The truth caved in on us, is how one person in the audience graphically described the speech. But as Tony Judt points out in his magisterial Postwar, it is important not to overstate what Khrushchev was attempting. His aim, not surprisingly, was a controlled de-Stalinisation that kept the revolutionary myth and the Soviet system intact. All the faults of the Bolshevik experience were laid at Stalin's door alone. But in his characteristically impulsive way, Khrushchev placed the possibility of a reformed Soviet system on the agenda. For the next decade, indeed, it was still possible to believe in that outcome, and there were true believers who persuaded themselves that it could happen, even 30 years later in the Gorbachev years. Harold Wilson's ""white heat of the technological revolution"" speech in 1963 can only be properly understood in the context of his fear that Khrushchev's boast that the USSR would outproduce the US by 1970 was well-founded. But the larger reality, as his biographer William Taubman says, is that the system never recovered from the secret speech and nor did Khrushchev.The most immediate reason for this, especially outside Russia, was the suppression of the Hungarian democratic revolution in November 1956. From that moment on, communism was irrevocably more about oppression than liberation. After Hungary the excuses would not wash, though many still made them (even my own father, in spite of the fact that he, along with the former teachers' leader Max Morris, was one of only two members of the British CP's executive committee to vote to condemn the Soviet invasion). After Hungary, as Judt puts it, communism became ""just a way of life to be endured"" until, mercifully, its misery and decline came to an end without large-scale bloodshed in 1989.It is of course true that, long before 1956, there had been generations of progressives, socialists of various kinds and even communists who had broken with the Bolshevik myth or who had never embraced it in the first place. Traditions of democratic and moderate socialism that predated the Russian revolution flowed on uninterrupted by 1956. Yet though not directly implicated by 1956 in the way that communists were, these other traditions on the left were challenged and damaged by what Khrushchev said and what the Red Army tanks then did in Budapest.The secret speech was a turning point because, in Eric Hobsbawm's authoritative phrase, while the October revolution created a world communist movement, the 20th congress destroyed it. Experience, whether in the form of Walter Benjamin's backward-looking angel of history or Barbara Tuchman's lantern from the stern (the image is essentially the same), had weighed the left in the balance and found it wanting. After 1956 socialism became more than ever just a matter of religious faith rather than reason. It would take another 30 or more years before that verdict was irrevocable. But it was the secret speech and Hungary that together, as Judt says, shattered the mirror in which the European left had always seen itself.But it shattered something else too. After 1956 it was no longer intellectually honest or true (if it had ever been) to use the cold-war syllogism that my enemy's enemy is my friend. Those who saw history as a long war between good (the left, socialism, the future, the Soviet Union) and evil (the right, capitalism, the old order, the United States) were no longer entitled to swallow their doubts. It was no longer sweet and noble to kill for the cause. A few, of course, still said it was. Even to this day one occasionally encounters the old lie that the Hungarian rising was a counter-revolution.But the cold-war syllogism lives on today in a new guise. Too many haters of capitalism and the United States still cram everything into the frame of untruth and self-deception that says my enemy's enemy is still my friend because, even if he blows up my family on the tube, murders my colleagues on the bus or threatens to behead me for publishing a drawing, he is still at war with Bush, Blair and Berlusconi. It is 50 years this month since that simplistic view of the world lost whatever moral purchase it may once have had. It is time such thinking was, to choose a sadly appropriate word, purged. Too long, my brothers and my sisters, too long."
3,"As a newly arrived Washington correspondent a few years ago, I made the obligatory call to the late Alistair Cooke, doyen and paragon of this newspaper's reporters from America. The hardest thing for most British people to understand about the American political system, he told me, was how important the judges and courts are within it. Few differences, he suggested, better illustrate the deceptive belief that Britain and America instinctively look at the world through the same eyes.That conversation came back to mind this week, and not just because John McCain was in London to deliver the first Alistair Cooke memorial lecture last night. It came to mind because George Bush is crossing the Atlantic in his turn this week, and is leaving behind a Washington in rare ferment. Yet the subject that has galvanised the American capital and that will be uppermost in the president's concerns during his trip to the G8 summit will not be global poverty or climate change, nor even Iraq.Even over the Fourth of July weekend, the resignation of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor detonated vast amounts of media and beltway speculation. Yet the retirement of the US supreme court's first woman justice is not merely a major Washington story. It is also potentially a seismic national political event - at least as important, in its own context, as the election of a president or a new congress.The nine-justice court is so central to the US system of government that any new presidential nomination to it would be important at any time - and with a gap of 11 years since the last one, a generation of would-be justices now impatiently awaits the call. But O'Connor's position as the swing voter on so many crucial decisions in the past decade and a half gives added weight to this moment. It means that the lives of millions of Americans will be shaped for years by her successor's stance on issues such as abortion, race and religion.That, naturally, is why so many on the right see this as an immense opportunity and why so many on the left see it, with equal fervour, as a moment of direst threat. For it has been an open secret ever since Bush became president (thanks in no small part to one of Justice O'Connor's most important swing votes) that many Republican party lobbies have no higher priority than to reshape the court under Antonin Scalia in an aggressively conservative mould - with a view to dismantling the role federal government has played in US life since at least the time of the New Deal. Without an election to face, Bush may share that view.Whether this actually happens may be another matter. Even with the Republicans in charge of both the executive and legislative branches of government, constraints exist. Most Americans are decent and pragmatic people, offended by the right's culture wars, as opinion polls consistently show and as the Terry Schiavo case recently reminded them. So Republican candidates in next year's mid-term elections may be uneasy about the effect of nominating a cultural-warrior judge. Bush will also be under pressure to nominate another woman; he did not get where he is today by ignoring the political middle ground, where O'Connor's cautious pragmatism and resistance to ideological jurisprudence played so well.Time for a general knowledge question. What is the name of Britain's newly appointed lord chief justice, who will take over from Lord Woolf on October 1 as the most important judge in the land? You will not be alone, I think, if you do not immediately call to mind Nicholas Phillips, who as Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers has presided over the court of appeal for the past five years. Nor are you likely to be the only reader not fully aware that Lord Phillips will be succeeded as master of the rolls by Sir Anthony Clarke, nor that Sir Igor Judge - surely the best name on the English bench - will be the new head of the Queen's bench division of the high court.These three major appointments were announced quietly in a press release a couple of weeks ago. The release contained almost no further information about the appointees. It is certainly no exaggeration to say that they received only cursory attention. No newspaper thought the story sufficiently interesting to put it on the front page. Fewer still followed it up. There was no debate among commentators, much less any public controversy, about the kind of questions that might normally apply: whether these were the right men for the top jobs, where they stood on significant legal issues of the day, or where these appointments might take the English courts.This was striking and eloquent, and not only because of the contrast it provides with what has just been unleashed in the United States. These appointments were, after all, the first under the very major changes in the structure of the English courts brought in by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. It might have been expected, therefore, that the appointment of Lord Phillips and his colleagues might have been marked in a way that signalled to the public, however carefully and properly, that they will be key figures in a new constitutional era.In the event, nothing remotely of the sort occurred. The truth is that the most senior appointments in our supposedly reformed judicial system have been made much as they were in the past - unheralded and with a minimum of openness.Fifty million dollars, it is said, will be spent in the battle for Justice O'Connor's seat. With two other justices in their 80s and a third a cancer sufferer, the process may soon be repeated with equal intensity, at even greater expense and with still more epochal consequences for America. From a distance, this can all too easily seem a travesty, even a corruption, of a process for selecting the most senior members of an independent and merit-based judiciary.But at least the American process is one that explicitly and implicitly recognises the centrality of the judges and the law to the constitutional processes of modern democratic government. In this country, with rare and distinguished exceptions such as Lord Woolf, our system is overwhelmingly in denial about such connections. That is what disturbs me about the furtive announcements here last month. If we meekly concede that we have no right to know anything about the highest judges in the land, or no right to call their thinking to public account in any way, then we are vacating a very important part of the public arena.We are rightly urged to foster a culture of respect. But unless we can respect judges, it is harder to respect the law. And unless we respect the law, it is harder to respect the system of government of which the law and the judges are such integral parts."
3,"Ever since 2001, the comparison between Tony Blair and William Gladstone has become columnar stock in trade. Matthew Parris, ever sharp, was one of the first to draw it after 9/11. Lots of the rest of us have echoed it since. And, yes, some of the similarities between the prime minister and his four-time Victorian Liberal predecessor are striking. Few British leaders have combined the religious, the morally driven, the interventionist and the impetuous more readily than these two.Yet the Gladstone-Blair comparison goes only so far. It is hard, for example, to imagine Blair returning from holiday in Egypt this week and feeling the inner confidence to say the following, noted down by Gladstone as he returned to London in the autumn of 1876 after campaigning against Turkish policy in the Balkans.  ""On Monday morning last between four and five o'clock, I was rattling down from Euston station through the calm and silent streets of London, when there was not a footfall to disturb them. Every house looked so still that it might well have been a receptacle of the dead. But as I came through those long lines of streets, I felt it to be an inspiring and a noble thought that in every one of these houses there were intelligent human beings, my fellow countrymen, who when they woke would give many of their earliest thoughts, aye and some of their most energetic actions, to the terrors and sufferings of Bulgaria.""  Politicians of the democratic age have a more cynical and nervous view of their countrymen and women. Rattling through the streets of London in the early hours in 2005, a passing prime minister is more likely to notice the ravages of late-night partying and drinking. And it would be a very confident leader who persuaded himself that the waking thoughts of many Londoners this week would concern the sufferings of Bulgaria or its current equivalent.   That is why it is going to take rather more than the current swell of national self-esteem about the British people's response to the Asian tsunami to reshape Blair's view of the electorate to whom he will shortly make his appeal. The popular response has indeed been inspiring, and may also be a reminder that better angels lurk within all but the most selfish souls. But it does not prove we are a nation of consistently energetic visionaries on the Gladstonian model.   In a sense, we have been here before. Twenty years ago, in the summer of the Ethiopian famine, it was briefly fashionable to see Live Aid and its associated work not just as a rebuke to Margaret Thatcher's aid policy - which it undoubtedly was - but even as a harbinger of new forms of political engagement - which it turned out not to be. Live Aid was, indeed, a major event. It left its mark on many lives. But it did not fundamentally change either Africa's vulnerability to famine or the state of British politics.  The response to the 2004 tsunami, like that to the 1985 famine, caught politics by surprise. In both cases, ministers were wrongfooted by the public's capacity for generosity. But in each case the furore about government inaction has frequently been a surrogate. Those who have had it with Blair have taken out their anger on the fact that he stayed on holiday. But such people would have damned him if he had come back (imagine the charges of presidentialism and headline chasing), just as they have damned him for not doing so. Any stick to beat a dog.  Nevertheless, things have moved on. Twenty years ago, we had a government that deliberately cut overseas aid, that saw supplicants as scroungers, and that was intellectually attracted to the notion that all aid was both corrupt and futile. Today, that is demonstrably no longer so. It would be a travesty to pretend that Blair shares Thatcher's gut contempt for aid as such.  None of this, though, makes Blair a Gladstone. The Grand Old Man may have thought he discerned a sleeping nation capable of being roused to action by Turkey's injustice towards the Bulgarians. Blair, by contrast, is more likely to discern a sleeping nation fearful of an influx of Turks and Bulgarians alike. And who is to say, despair over it as we may, that he is wrong about that? Right now, we may feel good about ourselves. But enjoy it while you can. Come the election, things are likely to be very different.  <B>"
3,"In spite of all the dramas and distractions of the modern world, I bet that right now there are millions of us whose attention is repeatedly - and sometimes unwillingly - drawn back to the most public private ordeal that many of us have witnessed. Even for those, like me, who are neither Catholic nor even Christian, these last days of Pope John Paul II - for that is surely what they are - have become an inclusive and shared drama. It is more than the 21st-century habit of voyeurism that makes it difficult to turn our eyes away from the Vatican this Easter weekend. For the ailing Pope is speaking to all of us, saying things about life and death that touch everyone in some way. It is nearly two weeks since John Paul was driven back to his apartments from the Gemelli hospital in Rome after a tracheotomy operation. Vatican aides, and the Pope himself, put on an extraordinary show, especially considering his age and physical weakness. They did everything they could to imply that the pontiff had made a strong recovery. He sat upright in the front seat of a grey Mercedes van, in full view but with his papal robes drawn tight around his neck to conceal the tube that had been inserted into his throat to ease his breathing difficulties. Behind his left shoulder, a camera crew captured the 84-year-old Pope waving to delighted roadside crowds.  It looked - and it was intended to look - as though everything was normal. But of course it was not normal at all - and we knew that too. It may, after all, have been the Pope's final earthly journey of significance. It was in many respects an El Cid moment - a form of defiance through faith that John Paul has gradually perfected through his career - suggestive of the climax of the Spanish epic when the dead Cid is strapped into his saddle to   lead his troops into battle against the infidels one last time.  Since then, the Pope has made five very brief public appearances, either in person or on video, all intended to create the illusion that he remains vigorous and fully in charge of the church. At the start of this week, on Palm Sunday, he appeared at his window, silently waving an olive branch to pilgrims below. Yesterday, Good Friday, he was due to participate by video link. Tomorrow, of course, comes the greatest challenge of all when the Pope has promised to be present in person to deliver the traditional Easter Sunday blessing, perhaps for the last time. The Italian press is calling it his Calvary.  Each of these appearances, though, only serves to underline the fragility of the Pope's real condition. The day before he left hospital, he spoke just a few words - first in his native Polish and then in Italian - from a sheet of paper in front of him. But the Parkinson's disease from which John Paul has suffered for more than a decade has now robbed him of his ability to speak comprehensibly, even in private, never mind in public.   Biographers such as John Cornwell suggest that this has been going on for some time. Speech was already a struggle when he received Archbishop Rowan Williams in October 2003. I know this stage in the progression of the disease. I saw the same thing happen to my own father 20 years ago.  John Paul II has conducted a very public battle with mortality for a large part of the past quarter century, ever since the Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca shot him in the stomach in St Peter's Square in 1981. About 10 years later, after a recovery from his wounds that provided evidence of his physical and mental strength, John Paul's Parkinson's was diagnosed. Since then, the signs of his age and infirmity have gathered in on him inexorably: at least   three falls, increasing knee problems, intestinal difficulties and the growing vulnerability to flu and other viruses that comes with degenerative weakness.  The determination not to give in is palpable and, given who he is, also intriguing. Like the Queen - whose authority in some eyes is also divine - there is not a thought of retirement. Personal convenience is dismissed as irrelevant. Christ, this Pope once told a group of pilgrims, did not come down from the Cross. John Paul has no intention of coming down from his.  But nor, in spite of the show of normality that he sometimes puts on, does the Pope intend to slip quietly into the shadows. He could easily withdraw, allowing a fiction of health and alertness to be maintained by the practised Vatican spinmeisters. It was what they did when Paul VI became ill in the mid-70s. John Paul, though, has chosen to ensure that we witness his passion. Every appearance at the window must, when you consider it, be a gruelling ordeal. But that, surely, is why he does these things, because he wants us to know and wants us to think about them.  However stricken he may be, even and especially now, John Paul clearly wants to leave no one in any doubt that he is fighting with death to the very end. He was described this week, by a senior cardinal, as ""serenely abandoning himself to God""; but that is not the impression he conveys at every opportunity he gets. His very insistence on showing himself to us is part of the struggle. It reached an eloquent climax on Palm Sunday, when he gripped his forehead as though in pain, then beat his hand on his lectern as if in frustration.  It is an extraordinary performance. All priests perform, of course, as all politicians do. And it is important to   remember that the young Karol Wojtyla was stage struck. He trod the boards of the Rhapsodic Theatre in Krakow 40 years before he trod the world stage. All the biographies make clear that Wojtyla had a large ego, too, long before he sat on the throne of St Peter. If you believe that the Virgin Mary interceded to deflect Agca's bullet from his vital organs, as John Paul does, or that you are the subject of one of the visions of the three seers of Fatima in 1917, as he also does, then you do not go gently or quietly.  Everyone fights for life. None of us seeks death. People always want to survive. John Paul, it turns out, is no different from the rest of us. He may be the vicar of Christ but even he does not want to go before his time. But John Paul is also doing more than fight for his own life. He seems to be using his position and fame to make a statement about all lives. He is saying that he is unwilling to be shunted off the stage before he is ready to go. He is saying that his suffering is universal. But he is saying, above all, that all lives are valuable, and that he is entitled to live his life to the very end, however hard it may be.  Believers will, of course, look for more - and find it. John Paul undoubtedly wants the faithful to draw lessons from his agony: lessons about euthanasia and assisted suicide, lessons about abortion, lessons about compassion, lessons above all about faith. Some non-believers may draw those lessons too.  But you don't have to embrace any of these to recognise that we are witnessing not just something remarkable, but something rare and instructive. All significant moments in life are hard to anticipate, but death is the hardest of all. John Paul is allowing us to share the enduring nature of that truth, even for a Pope. We are not just entitled to look. It is important that we should."
4,"Asked by Jeremy Paxman why he was getting married, Charles Kennedy replied: 'Because I'm in love.' This quaint response did not satisfy his questioner, who accused the Liberal Democrat leader of making a very public statement at a time when many people opt not to marry. How impertinent of Mr Paxman. Weddings may no longer be the province of Colette's 'young girls with papier-mch faces' and adolescent bridegrooms in hired Moss Bros, but there is an upsurge of veteran enthusiasts. Ron Davies, the former Welsh Secretary, is to marry his partner, Lynn Hughes, whom he met following his nemesis on Clapham Common and his subsequent divorce. Prince Charles, it is rumoured, may soon exchange vows with Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Church of England has lifted its ban on marrying divorcees.  As the Bishop of Winchester put it, the clergy can no longer keep its hands clean on remarriage. The problem for the church is that the demand for even grubby-fingered vicars is scant. The Office for National Statistics' latest figures show that only two in five ceremonies are religious, compared with more than half in 1991.  Still, weddings are increasing for the first time in eight years. Almost 268,000 couples got married in 2000, up 1.7 per cent on the previous 12 months and a sign, according to the pro-marriage lobby, of a revived institution. Not quite. The small rise was largely due to divorced people remarrying. Some serial monogamists will end up eternally content; for others the future pattern is Henry VIII minus the blood. The rate of break-up in marriages between two divorcees has doubled in two decades.  None of this is a reason not to marry. Charles Kennedy's wedding is a cause for celebration, however sour Mr Paxman might be. The point is that not getting married is equally valid, except to evangelists such as Linda Waite, a Chicago sociologist now advising British people trapped in bad relationships that staying together will make them happier than divorce.  Although Professor Waite's work must be conducted with an academic rigour untainted by her affinity with God and the Waltons, her surveys always look as perfectly cooked-up as a Martha Stewart apple pie. Invariably, they deem that married women (though not as content as men) are healthier and happier than their single counterparts. In future studies, Ms Waite will no doubt be proving that matrimony increases one's chances of becoming a lottery millionaire and Pulitzer prizewinner, besides insuring against cellulite and unwanted nasal hair.  While her findings deviate from the Wildean idea that marriage is 'as demoralizing as cigarettes, and far more expensive', they fail to establish why enthusiasm for the institution remains so low. Maybe, in a secular age, weddings, whether conducted at St Paul's or the West Bromwich Albion supporters' club, have become commercial and arid. The current Brides magazine contains, squashed between adverts for designer lace, a letter from a reader needing a cheap wedding. Serve sparkling wine instead of champagne, an agony aunt advises.  Let them drink Freixenet. This rallying cry may fail to usher the destitute to the altar, let alone reverse the broader trend. By 2021, cohabitants are likely to reach three million and outnumber married couples. Already, a quarter of babies are born out of marriage. As social mores have shifted, English law, which does not recognise cohabitation, has grown, if anything, less accommodating. The notion that being a common-law wife had any legal status disappeared in   Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act of 1753.  Far from being destroyed by Labour, as the Right always moans, marriage offers a lucrative cushion of tax breaks and financial guarantees for life. Property, pension and assets are for slicing up, post-divorce. Cohabitees, conversely, are entitled to nothing if a partnership ends. The first serious move against this imbalance came a few months ago in Lord Lester's abandoned Private Members' Bill, which proposed legal rights for gay and heterosexual couples who signed up to civil partnerships.  Why should a woman who has brought up her partner's children and looked after him and his house for most of her life be left destitute because she did not marry? Why should a man be made homeless because he had to pay inheritance tax after his male partner of 30 years died? Despite the urgency of such questions, some Ministers reportedly claimed that they would not be supporting the Lester Bill because the Law Commission, the Government's legal reform body, was completing a report on the whole issue.  The Commission was doing no such thing. Instead it had restricted itself to the narrower matter of rights to shared homes. On Thursday, baffled by trying to cut a deal that fitted incumbents ranging from a granny in an annexe to an abandoned lover, it announced that it had failed to come up with any solution.  This bizarre end to years of deliberation coincided with a separate blueprint from the Law Society, which last week ratified an internal report calling for registered civil partnerships. It also recommended, in an advance on Lester, redress for vulnerable ex-partners, whether or not they have opted into any formal system. As both the Law Society and the Law Commission urge a national debate, the Government says vaguely that its review of civil partnerships is 'ongoing'.  Ministers are nervous. The family values militants must, like some ghastly maiden aunt, be soothed and placated. The whiff of a fairer alternative always provokes tirades against cohabitation; supposedly a disposable arrangement for the feckless. But when the law expressly outlaws commitment, it is unsurprising that unmarried relationships look less durable.  In France and Sweden, where cohabitants have the legal safeguards decreed by almost all European countries, civil partnerships are as durable as marriages. Maybe intolerance underpins our talent for churning out 'feral' children; the truants and the failures. Perhaps there is an allied reason why British girls under the age of consent are eight times more likely to get pregnant than their French and Swedish counterparts. Relationships seen as legally sub-standard and morally dubious must be less likely to produce model citizens.  If cohabitation were a rarity, the effects of discrimination would impact only on individuals. But when not marrying becomes the norm, the unfairness of the current system risks corroding a society encouraged to be in thrall to skewed nostalgia.  Married coupledom, from the Macbeths to the Shipmans, has never been the idyll its supporters claim. The aftershock of marital schism and breakdown is apparent everywhere; in hideous domestic violence figures or in the death of Claude Mubiangata and his four children in a burnt-out car. Tragedy and horror are not the monopoly of the married, but nor do Handel and orange blossom offer a talisman against disaster.  There have been some advances towards accepting diverse lifestyles. Gay partners of MPs and civil servants now have the same rights as married couples, and adoption is less proscribed. It is vital now that the Government spurns the pro-marriage militia and moves faster. While the law and society should not dictate how people live, nor is it their role to damage those who can't or won't subscribe to an arcane agenda."
4,"Easter Sunday and the Lord has risen. You don't even have to be a Christian to feel his presence. God is everywhere. He has inveigled his way into the British election campaign by way of the abortion debate. He is at the Vatican, where the Pope is dying, and at the Las Pinellas hospice, in Tampa, Florida, presiding over the last hours of Terri Schiavo's existence. By this Easter morning, she may already be dead. George W Bush and his brother, Jeb, could not, in the end, prevail on the US judicial system to order that her feeding tube be replaced. Unlike God, who spent fewer than three days entombed, Ms Schiavo has had a long wait in the anteroom between oblivion and deliverance.  'Terri died 15 years ago,' her husband Michael said. 'It's time for her to be with the Lord, like she wanted to be.' While all informed doctors confirmed she was irredeemably brain damaged, her campaign website, supported by her parents, was upbeat to the last. A question in a Q&amp;A panel asked: 'Is Terri in an unresponsive coma?' 'Absolutely not!' read the response. 'Terri is a purposefully interactive, alert, curious, lovely young woman who lives with a very serious disability.'  As most Americans agreed, this grim tussle over a ruined life should have been for her family and the law. Instead, the President and Congress muscled in, making Terri Schiavo a peepshow doomed to take her small step to death before an audience of millions. The Schiavo case, not simply a parable of prurience and opportunism, illustrates the rise of God the politician, just as God the theologian sees his influence wane.  The worldwide Anglican communion is in disarray, and only 16 per cent of Britons say that religion is very important to them. Yet God is suddenly the referee of choice for a secular nation. Leading churchmen want to take abortion to the ballot box and though the Prime Minister warns evangelical Christians that faith and politics don't mix, the religious right smells power.  So thank God for science. In what promised to be a counter-blow for rationalism, the science and technology select committee last week produced its report on reproductive technology. Parents, MPs decided, should be able to select their baby's sex. A ban on reproductive cloning cannot yet be justified. Research on animal and human hybrids should go ahead.  Even those who think God and politics a dubious mix might flinch from a cocktail of man and mouse. But the most glaring example of a procedure known as chimeric experimentation was the committee itself. The parliamentary equivalent of a breeding attempt between a yak and a wildebeest produced a split-down-the-middle hybrid with five of its 10 members in revolt. One, Geraldine Smith, later claimed the report could 'pave the way to the kind of eugenics with which Nazi Germany was once experimenting.'  That, frankly, is daft. Five blokes equal a quorum for an indoor football side, not the crucible of a master race. The fact that the brave new worlders could not even get their peers to endorse the finished product suggests that the public will take some convincing. Which is a pity because many of the ideas are bold and right.  The trouble is that the report, in avoiding any discussion or middle ground, plays to the same   rules as religious hardliners. In its post-ethical premise, the very lucrative fertility market should be let rip and clinics need not consider the welfare of any potential child. Despite the disparity of their creeds, extreme libertarianism and extreme repression appear to share the same icy soul.  Inevitably, the nuances of life and death cannot be settled by diktat or false equivalence. Is 'balancing' your family by choosing the sex of a baby more or less benign than allowing particular embryos to be chosen to provide a cure for an existing child? I am uneasy about social selection and children picked by gender as a substitute for a brother or sister who has died tragically.  'Saviour siblings', on the other hand, are born to help another child, not to replace it. Why would that not enhance both lives? It is iniquitous that couples like the Hashmis, now awaiting an imminent verdict from the House of Lords, have had to fight so hard to have a baby who can provide stem cells to cure their six-year-old son, Zain, of a serious blood disorder. The committee is right to argue that such cases are for parents and doctors, not for pro-lifers leeching their sanctity from other people's heartbreak.  With science moving so fast, and the Human Fertility and Embryology Act of 1990 up for replacement early in the next parliament, it is vital that moderate politicians start addressing such issues. Instead, God has all the best lines and raw science, unfiltered through any ethical prism, has given him more ammunition. Already, churchmen have denounced a 'Frankenstein' report.  It is easy to see why God should hold such sway. In an age of materialism, even unbelievers recoil from any suspicion that children are just another commodity, priced according to specification, and that the sick can be disposed of when their warranty runs out. Somehow, the myth has grown up that atheists threw out hope and charity with their unwanted faith.  But morality is patently not simply, or even principally, for the religious. It is the driving force of all individuals and the glue of politics. It is in the DNA of good democracies which forge the legislative framework in which it can thrive. Godliness, by contrast, is not ersatz ethics for the public realm. It is private and it should stay that way.  Obviously religion can be progressive, too. Priests in Africa save lives, no strings attached, faith-based groups do valuable work, and even US evangelists with modest cars and bumper stickers asking 'What Does Jesus Drive?' are doing their bit for God and Kyoto. But if the strident voices prevail, then a future Britain risks being sandwiched between faithful zealots and the Dr Strangelove tendency, with liberal people of all faiths and none marooned in the space between. In that vacuum, progress will be squandered, lives spoiled and cures denied.  It is time for politicians to debate the questions they do not dare address. Why, for example, is society more worried about the few babies aborted at 23 weeks than about those born at the same age and encouraged to live, no matter how grave their disability? Why can people not die at a time of their choosing?  These are not questions for some far-off tomorrow. A Lords committee will be reporting shortly on Lord Joffe's Assisted Dying Bill, and a judge will decide next month whether Charlotte Wyatt, the baby doctors deem too sick to resuscitate, should be artificially kept alive.  Britain needs an inquiry similar to the Warnock commission of 20 years ago. But first, our leaders need to fight any idea that public policy should be shaped by the personal credo of a minority. Forget dog-whistle politics. The siren call of the dogmatists is the sound that we should fear most."
4,"B> The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday May 16 2004</B><BR><BR>  The article below states that  Private Lynndie England, the US soldier pictured trailing an Iraqi   prisoner on a dog leash, was from Fort Ashby, West Virginia 'by coincidence ... also home to Private Jessica Lynch, the all-American heroine of the Iraq war until it turned out that her  ""rescue"" from hospital was a stunt'. However, Jessica Lynch comes from Palestine, West Virginia, 210 miles from Fort Ashby.   <BR><BR>  <B><HR size=""1""></HR></B><BR><BR>  Private Lynndie R. England, trailing an Iraqi prisoner on the end of her dog leash, is the most loathed woman in the world. Cigarette in mouth, finger stabbing towards the genitals of naked victims, she is, according to one newspaper, 'the trailer trash torturer who shames the US'. Queens of violence, from Penthesilea of the Amazons to Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, can attract awe, but Lynndie is no upmarket she-devil. Instead, the response to the Abu Ghraib pictures sandwiches her somewhere between Myra Hindley and Maxine Carr in an all-women axis of evil. England reminds me a little of Carr. Same childish physique, same small town background, same terrible taste in men. Though England's lover and co-abuser, Charles Graner, is hardly Ian Huntley, there is not much to commend a grinning torturer with a Bible fetish and an alleged history of wife-beating. Like Carr, England is a bit-player who came to symbolise a wider horror story. Back home, family and friends are trying to work out how a 'sweet, down-to-earth' paper-pusher who wanted to be a weather girl turned into a preening sexual predator.  By coincidence, Fort Ashby, a one-traffic light town in West Virginia, is also home to Private Jessica Lynch, the all-American heroine of the Iraq war until it turned out that her 'rescue' from hospital was a stunt spun by the army. England, who is pregnant and held in North Carolina, is unlikely to have her reputation similarly downgraded. Now facing charges of assault, she heads the female cast list of a ghastly parody of the TV prison drama Bad Girls.  Janis Karpinski, a reserve brigadier general in charge of military prisons in Iraq, has been replaced by the man who ran Guantanamo. Including England, three of the suspects in the torture cases that happened on Karpinski's watch are female. In tune with a sexual motif deliberately repugnant to Arab men, one victim is seen with a pair of women's knickers draped over his head.  Amid the outrage inspired by such scenes, it is worth remembering that fury is selective. While uncharged suspects going slowly mad in Guantanamo or Belmarsh are not to be compared to Private England's trophy heap of naked men, human rights are not always an obsession in Britain or the United States.  Nor are violent women the aberration they are sometimes painted. Mothers ready to defend their children to the death are a common stereotype, while any notion that women are Stepford soldiers, caring and compliant, was challenged way before Boudicca headed the Iceni. But, though female warriors have a long history, their legends rarely dabble in gory detail, let alone the fact that bloodlust can be triggered more by role than gender.  In 1971, researchers at Stanford University randomly assigned 24 students to be either jailers or prisoners and discovered that the 'guards' quickly became swaggering sadists. Recent research by Professor Stephen Reicher, at St Andrews University, revisited the Stanford work and disproved the idea of automatic brutalism. Group culture and leadership, he found, were the catalysts that turned ordinary people of both sexes into tyrants.  Even so, revulsion at the England case stems partly from evidence that women soldiers, more often mentioned in Pentagon dispatches as victims of sexual assault by male colleagues, also revel in power and cruelty. The more troubling issue is who helped turn Lynndie England into an apprentice torturer. The list of suspects stretches from her superiors, through the CIA, to a president who called for the blood of 'evil' men and a society who watched him spill it. Somewhere in her obscene behaviour are the traces of all our fear.   The story that centres on Private England goes beyond gender. The Daily Mirror's disputed pictures of torture by British soldiers feature no women, though the Calvin Klein-style shots of a prisoner in his underpants suggest a hair and make-up team may be hovering in the wings. Real or phoney? That question should be applied more widely.  Mythology is a casualty of this war. Fairytales of female innocence are dead, laid to rest with the dream of the British soldier as an updated Rupert Brooke. If Frances Cornford's 'young Apollo, golden-haired, ... dreaming on the verge of strife,' still exists, then he didn't train at Deepcut. Yet stories of bullying at home and atrocities abroad have never sullied the notion that something in the squaddie's soul is forever Journey's End. There are many fine soldiers, obviously, but nostalgia sits uneasily with a shot, even if mocked-up, of a rifle butt crashing into a prisoner's groin.  Old visions may be shattering, but the greatest chimera persists. The Iraq war was founded on fantasy. The myths of WMDs and of cheering Iraqis fed the notion of domino democracy, in which clones of a nascent secular state would spread throughout the Middle East. The problems of remodelling a country assembled by the British from Ottoman empire leftovers was not addressed. Nor was the question of how a population that is 60 per cent Shia fitted, democratically, with US opposition to a Shia-led regime.  The occupiers' stock is near zero, and still, in Washington and Westminster, the myth lives on. As if playing the nursery game of grandmother's footsteps, Tony Blair and Geoff Hoon tread faithfully in Bush's erratic tracks. The US attacks Falluja, and Hoon is all for that. Troops give up and hand over to a Saddamite commander. Hoon could not have planned it better himself.  The defence secretary must have studied the Abu Ghraib pictures, including a plastic-wrapped corpse of a prisoner beaten to death and the shrouded figure of a man wired for electrocution, but he sounds sanguine. 'I do not see that it is torture: it is abuse,' he tells the Guardian.  Though not in the same league as Churchill's statement, in 1920, about the 'excellent moral effect' of gassing Iraqis, this sounds underwhelming.  In Iraq, a country of dying options, the UN and its security council are still the last, declining hopes of overseeing a transition to a sustainable future. As the choices fade, the coalition message remains: No change. Bush holds to the remains of his policy, and Blair, for whom moral certitude seemingly holds no Plan B, clings on beside him.  Lynndie England, however unpleasant, is not the the villain of this debacle. She is what happens when politicians prosecute shambolic wars in the name of piety. Lined up behind a heap of bodies topped by her gleeful little face are the shadowy stylists for this cameo of prison life.  The neo-cons who talked up this conflict helped create Lynndie. So did those who, like Colin Powell and much of the Parliamentary Labour party, failed fully to voice their doubts. Hers is not a parable of vicious women or bad-apple soldiers. It is not a cue card to remind ourselves that the Baathist atrocities of old would have seemed much worse than this, if only they had lent themselves to a Kodak moment.  Abu Ghraib is an interim report on liberation. After a year of fighting and untold thousands of civilian deaths, the great battle of good versus evil has managed to find a new hate figure. Saddam Hussein has been replaced as monster-in-chief by a former chicken processor from West Virginia. It does not feel like progress."
4,"The show is over and the screaming starts. Close your eyes and the reedy cries of teenage girls suggest the finale of a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert. That would be wrong. Instead, this is last Wednesday's performance of  Hedda Gabler at London's Almeida Theatre. Hedda, it is true, has messages for the PlayStation generation or, at least, its detractors. Born bored, as John Osborne put it, she is the pampered rebel who places her dangerous dreams at the centre of the universe. Give her an iPod, a double vodka and a slot in Heat and she would seem a modern stereotype. But Hedda is not Britney, any more than Henrik Ibsen is a natural contender for  Sugar magazine's gallery of 'lads who turn us on'.  So why the enthusiasm for fusty playwrights and Norwegian parlour tragedy? It's obvious really. The girls in the audience were a busload of Welsh pupils doing drama A-level. That makes them typical of a new breed of teenager, with  Teen Vogue in one hand and Ibsen in the other.  The demystifier of this tribe is Peaches Geldof, the 16-year-old daughter of Bob and Paula. Following a wave of pre-publicity, her one-hour documentary,  Teenage Mind, will be shown tomorrow night on Sky One. It is a film that every nervous parent should watch.  To explore what it means to be a teenager in Britain today, Peaches meets an advertising executive, a neuro-scientist, a sociologist with a nose ring, geeky tree-huggers (too uncool for her), a northern street gang (too antisocial), some chavs and rude boys, plus many of her own friends. The result, though varied, may contain too many £3,000-a-term accents for some tastes.   Then there is the precocity. At roughly the age when the new Pope was square-bashing for the Hitler Youth, Peaches has become a fully hatched opinion-former. Luciana Berger, the 23-year-old student who has been denouncing anti-semitism and rumours that she is Euan Blair's girlfriend, looks like Betty Boothroyd in comparison.  Both Peaches's youth and pedigree have prompted some media gloom. One newspaper profile hints nastily at similarities with her mother, but that is horribly unfair. Peaches is a droll observer and her film is an intelligent assessment of whether adolescence is chiefly a social construct or a hell imposed by unformed brains and unruly hormones as well as unreasonable old folk.  In addition - here's the bit for the nervous parents - she offers the sort of guidelines that adults try, often vainly, to impose by bribery, imprecation or edict. No to drugs, drink and eating disorders. Yes to pizza, homework and always telling your dad where you will be.  In Peaches's world, sketched out in her documentary and newspaper columns, teenage girls are diligent, if screwed up. ('When you reach 14, dieting is a way of life,' sighs Peaches.) They didn't think much of Pawlikowski's film,  My Summer of Love (arty lesbianism for grown-ups) but loved Thirteen (underage Hedda Gablers on substance-abusing self-destruct mission). Yes, teenage girls are the victims of a sexualised consumer society and of parents who expect them to morph seamlessly from 'peeing dolls' to adulthood.  And, yes, teenagers have sex. Peaches doesn't talk much about that (too embarrassing) but is all for sex education in teen magazines. The inference is that if your daughter is mature and well-informed enough to avoid pregnancy or a sexually transmitted disease, then what exactly is your problem? This sounds like a snapshot of teenage life recognisable   to most girls I know, though it will sound bizarre to some adults. Many prefer an Ibsen-style narrative and we are not talking dolls' houses here.  Surveygirl, the birth child of magazine polls and government statisticians, has grim prospects. She is either skeletal or designed along the lines of Andrea Dworkin. Her parents don't talk to her about sex and she may, like 22 per cent of 14-year-olds, have slept with a boy. If so, she was probably drunk on the first occasion (60 per cent are) and unlikely always, if ever, to have been protected by contraception (65 per cent aren't).  She might have been beaten by a boyfriend. Almost half of teenage girls think it's sometimes all right for boys to be violent, and 42,173 in the 15 to 17 age band got pregnant in the last recorded year, a tiny drop but astronomical still. Surveygirl's small sisters are already primed for mental illness or the depression that afflicts nine out of 10 teenage girls. An Australian study of five- to eight-year-olds found that half were thinking of dieting, which makes Peaches's 14-year-old weight-watchers sound almost menopausal.  Whether you buy the doom or go for Ms Geldof's sunnier view of adolescence, the consensus is that teenagers need some help. Whatever that package might comprise, it is barely visible in an election campaign which has failed to register their presence in 'hard-working families'.  Both Labour and the Tories are desperate to beguile the very young and old. Beyond the cradle, and before the grave, the state can barter benevolence for votes. Young teenagers, stuck in the middle with no suffrage, get little but a yobbish reputation. Yet, on the election trail outside London, the pensioners who are supposed to be terrified are pleading for more leisure centres for young people.   For months, youth services have been hanging on the government's green paper on youth, due out last year and overtaken by the election. A leaked version suggests scrapping the under-funded Connexions scheme, a sort of SureStart for teenagers, plus smart cards with discounts for activities, an administrative shake-up and not much extra money. Imaginative possibly, but hardly a revolution.  Teenagers deserve better from politicians. They need a catch-all education system geared to fine vocational training as well as university. They need compulsory school sex education with a parental opt-out only on grounds of faith. They need sports grounds and meeting places in every town and they need parents who can better decipher the people behind the hype.  Ms Geldof's message, if I have read it correctly, is that adult laments for squandered innocence are not only self-indulgent. They are also a foolish misunderstanding of how appearance changes almost nothing. Childhood is still childhood, even if it comes dressed in plunge-neck Lycra and Bad Girl eyepaint.  The other thing adults rarely see is that both studious sophisticates and girls risking their health for bad sex may actually be too unrebellious for their own good. Ninety four per cent of teenage respondents told a magazine that they want to be married by 25, and there is a growing evidence of a retreat to babies, domesticity and a dependency on male breadwinners.  Maybe these born-again traditionalists don't want to be like their mothers. Maybe they crave security in a society where freedom comes tempered with neglect.  Either way, it is worth heeding the teen gurus. Henrik Ibsen knew all about the dangers facing desperate housewives. And Peaches Geldof will be smart enough to realise that her success as a teenage visionary owes a lot to adult blindness."
4,"Family doctors are in despair and at breaking point, according to the chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee. That  cri de coeur produced a standing ovation from 400 delegates at last week's annual meeting and a few paragraphs in the  Daily Telegraph.  The public can dispense with most helmsmen of old civic life, from vicars to bank managers, but cannot do without GPs. Yet the news that half of them are thinking of resigning from the National Health Service causes barely a flutter of interest. Why should this be?  Partly because surgeries, with their red plastic chairs veined with grime and their composted  Reader's Digests have always hinted at frugal decline, but mainly because a new mood of suspicion grows. The image of Dr Harold Shipman, with his tidy beard and phials of powdered diamorphine stashed in his doctor's bag, is hardly a boost for a beleaguered profession. A more insidious destabilising force is at work   As doctors, complained of and complaining, become the new teachers, the Government underlines how lucky they are. The NHS Reform Bill specifies that, by 2004, they will control 75 per cent of the health service budget. The message is that autonomy equals beneficence. No doubt some GPs are grateful. Others may think that if they wanted to count cash, they could have been NatWest cashiers, or that being the procurer for unavailable or unaffordable treatments does not constitute a shopper's paradise. The political message counters such pessimism. Doctors have never had it so good.   Patients, conversely, have never had it so bad. John Major's patients' charter made us strident, and foreign holidays made us envious of those who get treated without spending half a day becalmed in a toxic A&amp;E department. ER,  Casualty and media scare stories mean we're experts in everything from small bowel transplants to the side-effects of Zyban. Some seek to sue doctors while others go for summary justice. Attacks on medical staff are running at 65,000 a year. Two in 10 Londoners fail to turn up for booked appointments, but that is our prerogative. Patients come first, the Government is constantly reminding us, as if malign doctors are trying to usurp those rights.   Two new constructs are being fleshed out. One is the doctor from hell, the other the patient from hell. If each protagonist sees the other as the enemy, that divide-and -rule stratagem may suit a government with plenty of other worries. The greatest reminder of recent failure will surface any day now, when the inquiry into the Bristol children killed by bungled heart surgery is revealed in Parliament. Ian Kennedy's investigation, the largest undertaken into clinical practice in the UK, will make Lord Cullen's report on the Paddington rail disaster look like a Post-It note.   It is so shrouded in secrecy that even Sir Barry Jackson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, has no clue on its findings about James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana, who, with their former chief executive, were found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct over 29 infants who died. Jackson hopes, of course, that Kennedy will acknowledge tightened standards making it 'virtually inconceivable' that there could ever be a reprise of Bristol. Tonight's Panorama  will argue, conversely, that a replay is all too likely. As the hype builds over the report, another question might be whether it was necessary at all.   Harold Wilson once said that he saw no need for a Royal Commission that 'would take minutes and waste years'. How fortunate for him that he was spared the current mood for paper-pushing. In the Harold Shipman inquiry, a million pages of information have been put on databases, a video link-up is in place to Hyde, where he worked, and £500,000 has been spent on installing IT equipment.   Where most public investigations are a requiem for official incompetence, this one is also a sleuthing exercise on how 459 patients died. Although few would deny relatives their right to know, only nine people arrived at the shabby viewing-room. One, a pensioner with a bag of sandwiches, could not bear to go in. For all the modish emphasis on 'closure', people don't always want old sorrow excavated, particularly when the aim is slaking public anger rather than personal grief.   The Bristol parents might have found some peace long ago, but for government dithering. The Health Department could have held its own, wide-ranging inquiry at the outset. Instead, it shuffled the case on to the General Medical Council, which, pending yet another reorganisation in July, is still perceived as unfit to hold a stewards' inquiry into a three-legged race at a primary school sports day. Hence the need for the gravitas of Kennedy. His report, two years in gestation, may criticise the Health Department. It is expected to focus on the failures of systems rather than individuals. Undoubtedly it will advocate more audit trails, although how those are to be achieved is unclear when the Government has shown no signs of providing promised money for a computer set-up.   Practical solutions cannot address a deeper ill- will. At the King's Fund president's lecture last Friday, a senior consultant said that he had been billed for several hundred pounds by a patient who had been kept waiting and wanted recompense for his 'professional time'. But where, the doctor asked, was he to find time? It seems the crucial question. British doctors, with annual pay rises of around 3.5 per cent, overtook their European counterparts in 1993 and stay comfortably ahead on wages. There are, however, only 1.8 doctors for every 1,000 Britons, against a European average of 3.4. GPs say an extra 10,000 are needed if government targets are to be met.   To some, this seems a bit rich. Royal College protectionism, decreeing that no one without multiple grade As at A-level was fit to assess the nation's bunions bred a lean &eacute;lite. Now medical school applications are dropping, from 12,076 in 1997 to 9,700 this year, and the panic is on. While there is some recognition on doctors' part that the clubbishness that helped foster rogues such as Rodney Ledward and Richard Neale was inexcusable, no one has yet worked out how to make health service jobs look appealing. Meanwhile, mutual mistrust and baroque inquiries obscure the bigger picture.   The Government has backed itself into a corner on health. In not much more time than it took Professor Kennedy to produce one report, it has to fix the entire NHS. As a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research will say tomorrow, its plans for private partnerships look flawed. A purely tax-funded service works only if the rich pay more tax.   That leaves either hypothecation or a social insurance model, such as the French one, where 90 per cent of the population pay around 17 per cent of their salary into a sickness fund and the poorest get the same care free. Although Blair dismisses both schemes, the suspicion is mounting that genuflecting to Beveridge must soon give way to something more radical.   As the real battle for a better health service begins, doctors and patients should be fighting on the same side."
4,"Robin cook likes a curry. I remember sitting opposite him in the Foreign Office canteen one lunchtime, watching him demolish a pile of tweed-coloured slurry draped over a gaudy heap of pilau rice. Personal preference may have informed his decision to spurn the Chinese takeaway (its image dented by foot and mouth) or the doner kebab (never a winner with the River Cafe set) and single out, during his speech to the Social Market Foundation, chicken tikka massala as a 'true British national dish'. How right Mr Cook is. There is something quintessentially British about the diner who piles out of the pub, 10 pints of lager to the wind, in search of an Indian meal to fortify him against a night of aggro. Nothing conjures up some aspects of our national culture more effectively than tanked-up, Union Jack-flapping soccer fans belting out the 1998 World Cup anthem of 'Vindaloo'. Even at the genteel end of the market, the flock wallpaper and acid lighting of the average high-street Indian takeaway evoke exhausting hours and low pay for its staff rather than get-ahead vibrancy. Cook might have been on safer ground if he had stipulated stuffed crust pizza or pot noodles as our culinary emblem of multiculturalism.  Alternatively, he could have recalled that politicians seeking to unfurl a vision of a certain type of Britain rarely sound convincing, whether their theme is cricket on the village green and spinsters cycling to Communion or an ode to an onion bhaji. Still, in some ways, the Baldwin of Brick Lane was successful. Given the febrile mood of the Opposition, all antidotes to racism are welcome.   As a bonus, Cook's catchy way into the race debate provoked predictable and gravy-curdling wrath from beef Wellington fans incensed by his statement that there was no such thing as an 'ethnically pure' British race.  Smoking out racism, in the Tory party and its supporters, would be more rewarding, but for the fact that the cheerleaders for Anglo-Saxon purity are so pathetic. John Townend was unknown before his recent anti-immigrant speech. Sir Richard Body, author of the xenophobically titled book,  England For the English , exudes as much Powellite menace as Peter Rabbit. James Cran and Eric Forth, opponents of the Commission for Racial Equality's code of electoral conduct, hardly add up to Jorg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen. Michael Portillo, the most senior non-signatory, is not a racist but a tactically- brilliant Judas whose gesture will endear him to all those Tories who cannot decide whether William Hague or the bossy CRE appals them more.  Hague is not a racist either. He is something almost worse, an opportunist who decided that it would be useful to mimic one. Hence his 'foreign land' speech, his authorisation of a leaflet on 'bogus asylum-seekers' and his swipe against the Macpherson Report. Some time ago, Andrew Lansley, the former Tory election strategist, told this newspaper that 'immigration played particularly well in the tabloids in the 1992 general election' and 'has more potential to hurt'. Now the pain is all Hague's. His attempt to be both asylum-seekers' scourge and immigrants' champion looks as fake as Lansley's assertion that his leader never played the race card.  Of course he did, but so has Cook; not through his message but by his omissions. In particular, his cosy, curry-house scenario seemed oddly pitched in the week when white and Asian communities in the north of England went to war. Whatever racial unrest exists in Britain today is less a product of Tory rants than of the reality of life in Britain under a   Labour administration which, as the Foreign Secretary did not say, has too often been a poor deliverer on issues involving race. Foot-dragging over the promised review of the iniquitous voucher scheme for asylum-seekers continues. The wider policy shambles has prompted the Council of Europe to castigate Britain for its treatment of migrants. While Hague might have been even harsher, the measure must be outcome, not intent.  Cook, like all his senior colleagues, is a committed anti-racist. Personal credo does not, however, entitle him or any of them to paint a vista of a wish-list Utopia and pass it off as the real thing. Modern Britain, however tolerant and well-integrated, is far from a frictionless haven. As Ofsted discovered last year, the failure gap between Afro-Caribbean and Pakistani pupils and their white counterparts is nearly double that of a decade ago. Students from ethnic minorities have a much lower chance of getting a job than white graduates. In one recent week on BBC2, the only non-white faces in the channel's top 10 programmes (combined viewing figures of 33 million) were those of cartoon characters in The Simpsons. While government cannot be held responsible for who joins Charlie Dimmock on  Ground Force , there is, in areas it can influence, too great a mismatch between rhetoric and results.  Despite the eagerness by Jack Straw and the Metropolitan police commissioner to apply the findings of Sir William Macpherson, old tensions reappear as the second anniversary of the report approaches. In Bradford last week, a fight at a Hindu wedding erupted into a car-burning, window-smashing, battle between white and Asian youths which echoed the devastating 1995 riot. In Oldham, the tribal battles between young Bangladeshi and Pakistani men have mutated into a new delineation of aggression. According to police, more than half of the 572 racist attacks recorded in the town during the last year have been against whites. However the battle lines are drawn, the causes remain a constant dirge of unemployment, overcrowding and bleak futures.  An exponential rise in the nationwide reporting of racist crime, up by 107 per cent over 12 months, no longer looks like Macpherson-inspired openness. It looks like more racist crime. That is not to criticise Sir William or those who seek to implement his recommendations. It is to say that there is a vast, unbridged gulf between semantics and solutions.  Presentationally the Government (asylum-seekers apart) has been a model of correctness, but signatures on CRE declarations and benedictions to Macpherson are the easy bits. They are also camouflage on the uncomfortable reality that, at a time when racial harmony is lauded and the economy is strong, too little has been achieved.  The conditions that create inner-city brawlers and school failures are also the complex issues of economic and social polarisation that fail to interest the Tories. The measure of their cynicism is that both Hague and Portillo have now, in different ways, mortgaged race issues to personal ambition.  As for the Government, Robin Cook's vision of a multicultural nation sitting down to break poppadoms together does not quite reflect a landscape in which teachers, police officers, politicians and the judiciary remain disproportionately white.  A Conservative Party that shows no sign of being in a position to ensure that such unfairness prevails looks less worrying than the prospect of a second-term government failing to alchemise its wishes on racial equality into results. Squandered influence is always more dangerous than none."
10,"British agriculture is enduring its toughest spell in living memory. Farm incomes have fallen by three-fifths since the mid 1990s and things will get worse. European enlargement, billed for 2004, means that British farmers will have to compete with the low-cost bread- basket of Europe. Eastern Europe's arrival spells the inevitable reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, further lowering prices. The pressure to open up Europe's agricultural markets to producers worldwide is unrelenting. Add on the emergence of the supermarket chains with their enormous buying power, squeezing margins still more, and British farmers can be forgiven for feeling something close to despair. What is required is a root-and-branch rethink of how we use our land. The truth is there is no future for the farmer lifestyle celebrated in The Archers. The tragedy for rural Britain is that just when it needs the nation to engage with its acute crisis it has chosen to link its fortunes with the debate over fox-hunting,   so distancing itself from the allies it needs and betraying in the process a proclivity for a conservatism of approach that is the least helpful way forward. The hope that with more hand-outs, the request at the core of next Sunday's Liberty and Livelihood march, all can be the same is self-delusion. Change is unavoidable.  The scale of the problem is breathtaking. The average net income for British farms is £5,000, even lower for hill and sheep farms, well below the yearly income on a minimum wage job. Moreover, the fall is gathering pace. The combination of the high pound against the euro, a worldwide glut of agricultural production and a CAP that cannot offer any relief because it is already too expensive has meant that most agricultural product prices are falling in real terms , even as input prices, notably fuel and fertilisers, rise in price. If parts of the country are big winners from globalisation, agriculture is certainly a loser.  Farming is in recession because it is in the grip of severe price deflation. Farming may even be the precursor of the same phenomenon stretching into other areas of the economy; manufacturing confronts a similar pattern of overproduction and falling prices, and there is emerging overcapacity worldwide in industries as disparate as airlines and financial services. Consumer prices have fallen for the last four years in Japan, and factory gate prices are falling in both   the US and the EU. Some economists are predicting that both economies will follow Japan into a period of deflationary falling consumer prices, a grim prognosis for output and employment.  Farmers like to portray themselves as the victims of a vendetta by heartless urban dwellers who do not understand rural life. The truth is that agriculture is an industry like any other, at the receiving end of similar forces. Indeed, compared to manufacturing, farming production and employment are holding up comparatively well - and enjoy an annual £3 billion subsidy on top.  That does not mean the scale of the human tragedy is any less; the collapse of his father's farm described by Richard Benson in today's Review is profoundly affecting. It is not just the loss of a business and a job; it is the loss of a way of life. If the land falls idle, then part of our collective birthright also changes. Yet the same was said of the loss of mines, shipyards and steel mills. They had to go because the sums did not add up, a process made worse by British economic policy.  The issue is twofold. Could the force of the crisis be softened by a different institutional structure and policy mix? And could rural Britain be offered better support as it transforms its economic base? The answer to both is surely yes.  Farming suffers from two chronic weaknesses; it is poorly organised before the bargaining power of agri-business   and it lacks access to cheap, long- term credit from the type of specialist farming banks that exist in mainland Europe. It needs to organise itself in powerful co-operatives that capture more of the food-processing business locally and insist on higher prices from supermarkets. If the co-operatives are to have sufficient financial muscle, then they, in turn, need to be able to get supportive finance from a specialist farming bank.  If Britain were to join the euro at the kind of exchange rate advocated by manufacturers - some 15 per cent below the current rate - the combination of these measures alone could boost farm incomes up to a quarter. Not massive; but enough to have kept Richard Benson's father in business. Equally, the infrastructure of social support has been weakened by transport deregulation eliminating many rural bus services and the right-to-buy legislation, so that there is a chronic shortage of affordable housing in most rural areas, an issue highlighted by our Focus today. Nor does the land issue stop there. Successive government's willingness to allow inheritance tax to become a token tax has meant that land ownership has become highly concentrated. In the 1940s and   1950s, tenant farmers had a chance of buying land as large estates sold off tracts to pay estate duty. No such chance exists today with most big landowners holding their land in offshore trusts. As a result, there is a cohort of ageing tenant farmers unable to buy their farms, diminishing even further their access to credit because they have no collateral.  It is not just official commissions like this year's Curry inquiry which believe the rural economy has to diversify. This view is shared by almost every independent analyst. Organic farming, eco-tourism, building attractions such as Cornwall's Eden Project - there are host of ideas to hand. But all require leadership and finance and that, in turn, requires the kind of institutional structure and fairer pattern of land ownership that we currently do not have.  The Countryside Alliance should be pressing for Britain to join the euro, and for enforced and increased inheritance tax, an end to right-to-buy legislation, support for specialist farming banks and powerful co-operatives, the reregulation of rural transport and a drive to diversify the rural economy around a recast CAP. Instead, it offers reheated euro-scepticism, self-pity and a call to protect fox-hunting. Those who live and work in rural Britain deserve much, much better. They are lions lead by scarlet-jacketed and braying donkeys."
10,"Ten years ago tomorrow, The State We're In was published. Overnight, I changed from being another economics writer to someone the  Daily Telegraph  described as the most dangerous man in Britain, so helping to ratchet up the sales of an improbable bestseller. But how does the book stack up in 2005? For conservatives, my crime was that I had written a too plausible but none the less wrong critique of what Mrs Thatcher had done to Britain. The danger was that it might persuade the New Labour leadership and worse - many voters - into wanting something other than the pure milk of the free market.  Britain had developed a fractured '30/30/40'society - 30 per cent disadvantaged and marginalised; 30 per cent insecure; 40 per cent privileged. This was created by a capitalism preoccupied with short-term financial gains and the next deal rather than building businesses and husbanding workforces.  Such an arrangement was sanctioned by an amoral conservative political, business and financial class that deployed the power of the monarchical British state and the accompanying icons of gentlemanly prestige to privilege markets and denigrate a shared conception of the public realm. But the annoying conclusion   the book drew (for both the old left and the new right ) was not to despair of capitalism, but rather, recognising its fecundity and power, to propose its reform around so-called 'stakeholder' principles. This involved incorporating values of inclusion, commitment and fairness in the bedrock of capitalism, which would be further entrenched by constitutional reform to give Britain a less monarchical democracy and a better chance of expressing the public interest.  Rereading the book with some trepidation last week, I found myself as convinced about this core analysis as ever. The two chapters on how our financial system betrays business still stand (despite some small improvement) and I remain a champion of stakeholder capitalism together with a vital public realm as a means of achieving better economic performance and a fairer society.  But over 10 years, the world has inevitably moved on. Some of the darker concerns of  The State We're In  have not happened, in part because New Labour, although fashionably derided, has stemmed and reversed some of the adverse social trends, and in part because some of the assumptions I made about what was economically sustainable and how capitalism worked in an era of globalisation have proved wrong.  I thought that British consumers, saturated with debt from the 1980s, could hardly rescue the British economy again and, even if they did, that our export earners were so weakened by Thatcherism that if the economy grew at any meaningful rate, Britain would be left with a huge trade deficit. Companies could only find a way out by being offering ever meaner and insecure work. I began the book six months after Britain's exit from the ERM, when, without a decisive change of course, the best bet seemed more of the previous 20 years of economic decline.  In that sense, the book was very much a child of its time. What I couldn't anticipate was the extent to which globalisation, worldwide low inflation induced by rock-bottom commodity prices and a glut of manufactured goods and a new approach to economic management instituted by Norman Lamont and developed by Gordon Brown changed Britain's economic options.  In this new world of low inflation and interest rates, Britain's consumers could rescue the economy with another credit boom, and globalised financial markets would finance my correct prediction of the resulting trade deficit. Moreover, globalisation would offer unexpected parts of the British economy - its universities, its media, its software industry, its accountancy and consultancy firms and even its traditional multinationals - opportunities that could not be seen in 1994. The result has been unparalleled growth in the economy and jobs and a rising tax base that has financed a better NHS and primary-school system.  It has needed a two-term Labour government to reorder Britain's spending and tax priorities, and here is a change that I argued for but could only hope would happen - the rediscovery that Britain, at core, is a liberal, rather than conservative, society, the explanation of Labour's continued poll lead, despite the cynicism with which Blair is now regarded. Paradoxically, Lady Thatcher   shattered the already decaying conservative establishment and while Britain's new elite is by no means New Labour, it is too self-confident to revert to an instinctive conservativism. The point about the Countryside Alliance, for example, is its weakness rather than its strength; old associations have gone for ever.  But as I feared in 1995, New Labour has not trusted the possibilities seriously to capitalise upon the opening, notwithstanding the progress it has made. The Blair/Blunkett wing wants no truck with Britain's liberal tradition beyond what a limited One Nation Toryism might concede, although its bias in favour of science, multiculturalism and the environment makes it a different kind of political animal.  The alliance with Gordon Brown and his strand of New Labour, readier to do business with the British progressive tradition (though much closer to Blair than many of his supporters concede), has become ever more uneasy. Unless the two can broker a common position, a process made difficult by the way the British state concentrates so much power in the Prime Minister, New Labour risks finding itself in the same broken-backed position as today's Tories. Britain's unreconstructed state helped do for the Conservative party by focusing so much power on Thatcher; it could do the same to Labour.  Here  The State We're In made a misjudgment I would give a lot to change. If I had made the case for stakeholding much more around Britain and America's experience - and downplayed its success in German and Japanese companies, where so much is muddied by other economic problems - the argument would have been culturally easier to accept. In  Built to Last, James Collins and Jerry Porras showed how 17 of America's best and most innovative companies had been constructed on stakeholder principles - organisational purpose, long-term commitment and worker engagement. It has been the US's bestselling business book.  Presented in those terms, Blair might have been attached to stakeholding for longer than the 10 days he flirted with it after his Singapore speech in 1996 - and even Brown, so attached to American enterprise, might have given it more support. But Collins and Porras published  Built to Last when  The State We're In  was already at the printers.  The economic challenge of the next decade is to create a viable knowledge economy. New Labour has laid some foundations via its science investment and its strengthening of universities. It now needs to go further by invigorating the idea of stakeholding and business building. On this, at least, it could find agreement.  But modern capitalism is an ever moving target; trying to understand it, and then making and agreeing a compelling case for reform, is bloody difficult. I'm still proud of  The State We're In; I won't make the same mistakes next time - just some new ones."
10,"Nothing more betrays the hollowness of New Labour's claim to be 'new' than its attitude towards reforming the state and its equivocation about democracy and the sanctity of the public realm. It just doesn't get it. Beyond a group of disillusioned intellectuals, it thinks, nobody cares about voting, accountability or the shape of the constitution.  The national belly-laugh at the House of Lords' Appointments Commission's announcement of 15 new peers should begin to disabuse it. The patronising view that ordinary people have no interest in the hows and whys of their constitution has been punctured. These aren't people's peers; they are from exactly the same pool of great and good who have been occupying the red benches as life peers for the past 40 years.   It wasn't meant to be like this. The commission is independent. It canvassed the country for applications. It has five criteria for selection for a peerage - independence, commitment to high standards in public life, a record of   achievement, capacity to contribute to debates and the spare time to attend them - that seem reasonable. The peers to be produced by this rational process would be obviously superior either to the old hereditaries or party hacks.   But the ill-judged aside of Lord Stevenson, chairman of the commission, that 'the human being should feel comfortable in the House of Lords', gave the game away. What is at issue, as Tom Paine, writing 200 years ago, saw more clearly than any other critic of the British constitution, is a structure and culture in which our governors still function as a class above the governed.   As Paine put it, the invading Normans constructed a constitution that allowed the new French-speaking barons to deliberate and then do what they wanted to the subject English. That was the way the system essentially operated in 1800. Universal suffrage and the veneer of modern democracy have been bolted on to the same structures, so that much of what Paine inveighed against is still alive.   For excellence and career achievement, along with feeling at home on the red benches, are utterly inadequate criteria for becoming a national legislator. I'm sure that Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP, or Professor Susan Greenfield, director of the Royal Institution, will make wise and considered interventions in those debates where their expertise will be welcome. But the Lords could have availed itself of their wisdom without making them full-time legislators. It could easily and simply have asked them to become full-time members of its select committees or to give evidence on legislation.   But the solution that has been adopted means that because the newly appointed peers have a track record of achievement in one area, they have the right of voting and speaking in all areas - from asylum-seekers to fox-hunting - despite the fact they are accountable to nobody for how they vote.   This is an impossible principle to defend. Arguments that elections might be dangerous because turnout could be low, that the intake might be unpredictable, that the Lords will gain a legitimacy to rival the Commons and that party point-scoring will replace the considered tone of the Lords are spurious. They are dangers that have to be guarded against, but they cannot obstruct the basic position. In a democracy, legislators must be accountable to the people.   Indeed, the proposition is even larger than that, a point well understood by Paine and his contemporaries in enlightenment Europe, who were delightedly shrugging off centuries of rule by monarch and church. Any community needs a functioning and efficient public realm where argument can be freely made, political support marshalled and those who make decisions can be held to account by those for whom they are   made. The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century constitution builders in Europe and the US did no more than try to construct a political architecture that could permit the expression of an accountable public realm, in which democracy and citizenship were key components.   Britain has never tried self-consciously to build a constitution that entrenched and succoured the public interest. The political class has always taken the view that the constitution, designed by the Normans and amended by successive generations, is pretty much unimprovable. But the consequences of this failure are all around. We may not care much that we have the fewest elected officials per thousand of population of most democracies, but more worrying is our lack of commitment to the principle of voting and, beyond that, to an idea of a public sphere. Our spatchcock constitutional arrangements suffuse our public culture, and that culture itself is compromised by our lack of faith in a conception of 'publicness'.   So it is that 3,166 people filled in the form to become a peer, thinking that nothing could be more normal than becoming a legislator via a university-type admissions system. So it is that we do not have the constitutional template properly to entrench the independence of a public corporation like the BBC. In our constitutional system, the public realm is the Crown in Parliament which controls all it surveys; there can be no true independence for anything within its embrace.   So it is that the Government has constructed Private Finance Initiatives and Public Private Partnerships without ever, until being challenged by Ken Livingstone, thinking carefully what the constitution of such arrangements might be that would entrench and safeguard the public interest.   And even the concession that a PPP might have public-interest 'partnership' directors has been squeezed grudgingly from a disinterested Government. And so it is that even the principle of universal taxation has just been breached, with the Government conceding that business can choose what tax it pays instead of local authorities having the right to charge a supplementary business rate. We are back to pre-Civil War England.   The hope was that when New Labour took office and launched its constitutional reform programme that it understood this was the means to the greater end, renewing and so reclaiming Britain's battered public realm.   We were wrong. New Labour had no such ambition. But as the laughter over people's peers reverberates, maybe it will learn. If it wants fewer such cock-ups, it should understand the spirit of the times."
10,"It is a decisive moment in the Middle East. Hamas, victor in the Palestinian elections, may turn out to be Islamic variants of the African National Congress or Sinn Fein, the terrorists who negotiated the only and obvious peace settlement. Or this victory may point to a new era of violence, the despair of the Palestinians legitimising a new wave of terror.Islamic fundamentalism, the ideology of terrorist suicide bombing and the passionate sense of Palestinian injustice is a lethal combination and Hamas is its most obvious expression. To suppose that Hamas can drop its commitment to liberating all of Palestine and resisting Zionism's claims to the last is to suppose the impossible. Now that its stance has been validated by voters, perhaps nothing can be expected except violence and political impasse.My hunch is that we can expect better and that Hamas will try to move away from terrorism. For while it may have earned its place in Palestinian regard through its uncompromising role in the intifidas, it has to do something with the political capital it has won. The decision last summer to participate in elections for a legislative council that was created by the Oslo accords it once fiercely opposed was itself a straw in the wind. Hamas always was as much a political as a religious organisation and its political dimension was there for all to see. Now it has won, it is locked in a political, rather than terrorist, dynamic.Last Friday, Hamas crossed a line when it became Palestine's majority party. Suddenly, it is no longer just Hamas leaders in private who can decide that terrorism is justified; they have to justify it in their parliament and before the wider bar of Palestinian public opinion. The occupation may go on, but the political position of the principal resistance movement has been transformed.Reflect on what terrorism constitutes. Brazilian terrorist Carlos Marighella defined it simply as 'the use of a bomb attack' to stir revolutionary class war. But that's useless. Against whom, exactly? How is any bombing decision arrived at and by whom? If governments carry out bomb attacks, they follow the due process of international law and call it war. Any definition of terrorism surely has to tease what distinguishes it from warfare.The starting point is that terrorists necessarily place themselves outside any substantive legal or democratic process; they alone decide that the terrorist act is justifiable and what the terrorist act will be. Terrorism is not war because no process of public justification or formal legitimacy stands behind it. Nor is it political violence, because the targets it chooses involve the collateral death and maiming of innocent non-combatants.An assassination or bombing of a military target is political violence rather than terror; it has rationality and targeted political purpose. Suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv restaurant does not. It is these qualities - the absence of any substantive legal process, randomness of target and collateral death of innocents - that define an act as terrorist.Justifying terrorism as a general principle is impossible. There are acts of terrorism which have had desirable consequences, like the end of apartheid in South Africa. But that is no more than our acceptance of realpolitik, reflecting the side we're on. Palestinian resistance to cruel occupation and the confiscation of their land is understandable, but that does not mean it can shelter under a general moral principle justifying terrorism. The only principle available to justify terrorism is that the consequences of its actions justify the violent means. But if the terrorist has not subjected his or her intentions to any kind of scrutiny, participation or vote by the people for whom he or she is acting, then there is no escaping that the decision belongs in the same category as murder. This is even true if the act of terrorism is to try and right a great wrong, which is what Hamas would claim.This is why Hamas's election victory is so significant. The movement cannot dodge the fact that, as the new majority party, its morality is no longer its own. It cannot plan a suicide bombing without opening up what it proposes to democratic scrutiny, legal process and wider Palestinian public opinion - or else expose itself to the charge of fundamental hypocrisy. The Palestinians may agree that they should resist Israel with violence, but this will now become an act of war rather than a clandestine act of terrorism. And Hamas does not want war.Already this reality is forcing extraordinary change. Two senior Hamas leaders have indicated that their charter, which calls for Israel to retreat to pre-1948 borders, could be amended. It has accepted that it cannot impose sharia law. Furthermore, Palestine possesses the embryonic institutions of a genuine democracy. It has three newspapers with some of the freest commentary in the Arab world. It has a fiercely independent judicial council committed to developing an independent judiciary and rule of law. It has a two-party political system and free elections. Hamas has to operate within these constraints, knowing that Fatah will want to win power back. It has to deliver solid administration, abandon terrorism, maintain the truce and try to achieve a long-term settlement. But the encouraging political reality is that it does so, for now, with all the legitimacy that its militancy has earned it inside Palestine.The worst mistake that the international community could commit is to refuse all dealings with Hamas. This is a moment when the West must commit even more aggressively to support and strengthen Palestine's fragile democratic and welfare infrastructure. It is far too early to talk of progress on a peace settlement, but Hamas could eventually prove to be as promising a partner for peace as Fatah and Yasser Arafat were once considered to be.The paradox is that Hamas would never have had its chance without the American conviction that the route through the Middle Eastern quagmire was the progressive introduction of democracy.But it's not just voting that will count in Palestine; it is, by Arab standards, the free press, the independent courts, trade unions and enfranchised electorate.Hamas now has to justify its actions before this demanding audience and terrorism will not stand the test. But the legitimacy that its courage has earned will allow it options on political strategy that Fatah could never possess. The West's job is to make sure this happens and that Israel is not allowed to pass up the opportunity."
10,"After the sack of Nanjing in 1841, then imperial capital of China, the British secured what the Chinese still call the unequal treaty; Britain won control of Hong Kong and the right to trade freely in opium; the Chinese got nothing. And it was at Nanjing in 1937 that the Chinese were again and more bloodily humiliated by foreigners. The Japanese murdered an estimated 300,000 civilians and soldiers in an atrocity whose calculated, indifferent cruelty rivalled a Nazi death camp, but to which the world has been curiously indifferent. Yet today this once decaying symbol of China's century-long weakness is at one end of a booming 250-mile-long corridor of factories and worker flats; at the other end sits the throbbing mega-sprawl of Shanghai.  China is beginning to meet the economic expectation that it has long promised but never delivered, due to a phenomenon that dare not openly speak its name. Capitalism, a distinctive and more socially minded Chinese capitalism but capitalism none the less, is irreversibly taking root in the world's most populous, and communist, country. Nothing is likely to be the same again. Nanjing's ambitions, and its capacity to meet them, is tribute to that. As the deputy director of the city's economic commission explained to me, it aims to become China's number one knowledge city. It has 37 universities. A state-of-the-art metro system with bullet trains begins operation this autumn. The plan is to combine this extraordinary infrastructure with the opportunities of globalisation to make the city's three core industries - automobiles, petrochemicals and ICT - super-competitive.  I asked him and a group of businessmen he had arranged for me to meet if there was any going back. None they nodded in unison. Nobody in China had any other prospectus than more of what was so evidently working.  Openness to inward investment is galvanising Nanjing's industrial base. Ford and Fiat have given the local car and truck industry, and its supply chain, critical mass and international quality standards. The latest addition is Rover, for Nanjing is where Rover's new manufacturing capacity is to be located after its Chinese takeover. The plan is that Rover's research capacity and high value-added production in Birmingham are to be maintained while volume car production takes off in the Nanjing-Shanghai corridor, taking advantage of the new access to the European market. (Eurosceptic TGWU leader Tony Woodley has a chance of saving some of his members' jobs courtesy of Britain's EU membership, a reality I hope he recognises in the coming EU referendum.)  The Rover bet may even come off. Part of the current economic alchemy is that Chinese wage costs are up to a 30th of those in the West for workers whose skill levels and productivity, with the same equipment, are equal to their Western counterparts. Every worker who leaves the land for the factory thus contributes to the boom. The other part is rising demand, fuelled by increasingly affluent Chinese consumers in their hundreds of millions, together with a protracted Keynesian stimulus on infrastructure spending on an unparalleled scale. The resulting growth, if it continues, will turn China into the world's second biggest economy within 20 years.  The change-makers on the ground are an increasingly confident Chinese private business sector and a tidal wave of foreign inward investment, all aware that this is the 21st-century Klondike. Even some of the wholly nationalised, inefficient, state-owned enterprises burdened by having to provide cheap houses and pensions for every worker are getting in on the act. I visited one, the shipbuilding company Hudong-Zhonghua, that is growing spectacularly, combining all the Chinese advantages of scale and cheap labour with a commitment to high-quality engineering and ICT systems. It builds high-tech ships as well as anyone and for a fraction of the cost.  But maintaining the pace of growth is not guaranteed, a potential disaster for an economy that needs to find 10 million new jobs a year to hold off massive social unrest. Hudong-Zhonghua is the exception rather than the rule. Most managers of Chinese state-owned enterprise are communist administrators with no idea about business practice. Paying interest on bank loans, for example, is an alien concept; if the big four Chinese banks, despite massive infusions of capital, ever had to accept the resulting loan write-offs, they would go broke. But it's a contagion that affects the private sector. Half the shares quoted on the Shanghai stock market have never paid a dividend. Too many Chinese businessmen think that money comes free; if the attitude doesn't change, ultimately the money tap will have to shut, bringing the growth engine to a halt.  It is issues like these that are now preoccupying the party leadership, as last week's annual party conference showed. The first phase of China's growth - opening up to globalisation, permitting a limited degree of market freedoms and launching a wave of massive infrastructure spending - has been the easiest.  The 'soft' infrastructure of a market economy - accounting practice, credit appraisal, allocating resources to companies that need it, trustworthy and predictable law, professional, uncorrupt business ethics, worker representation and voice, free information flows and a critical media - has to be both permitted and then developed to sustain growth. Businesses, for example, have to pay interest on their loans and dividends on their shares and to be held to account if they do not.  Last week marked a turning point; the leadership openly recognised that addressing these issues was to define the next phase of Chinese development, along with a redoubling of efforts to lower the stunning disparities in wealth between the booming east coast and the desperately poor west. But the prerequisite is to maintain the growth momentum and that, in turn, is now dependent upon a robust soft infrastructure. Which, in turn, means completing the transition not just to the form of capitalism but to its content.  The Communist party doesn't call it that; it prefers 'harmonious economic development' or the 'socialist market economy'. But this is capitalism by any other name. It is certainly not red-blooded, hire-and-fire American capitalism, nor ever will be; there are too many subtleties, informal networks and too much concern to do right by the wider Chinese society for that. 'Confucian' capitalism will join European capitalism as another economic and social model with which to challenge the US variant.  But it will be impossible to develop a soft economic infrastructure without political ramifications; a soft political infrastructure that embodies more transparency, pluralism and accountability is part of the same process.  In short, a form of democracy is on the agenda; the question is not if but how and what. It will have to respect China's particularities. There is acute awareness about how easy it is for a country of 1.3 billion people to split, but it must happen none the less. The genie is out of the bottle and the future of the world hangs on the outcome."
0,"The nomination of Libya as the country in charge of the UN's human rights business next year has not pleased everyone. Although its absolute ruler, Colonel Gadafy, who once sponsored the murder of British citizens, now cuts such a fine figure of a dictator that he has been honoured with a visit from our own Mr O'Brien of the Foreign Office, sticklers for human rights insist that an oppressor of his stature is not really the ideal person to convert the rest of us to freedom of speech, freedom of association, and all the other freedoms which remain, at the time of writing, prohibited in Libya. Human Rights Watch (HRW), the New York-based campaigning group, was the first to denounce Libya's nomination by the African regional group (whose turn it is to appoint the human rights ""chair""). ""Countries with a dreadful rights records should never be in charge of chairing the commission on human rights,"" says Rory Mungoven, HRW's global advocacy director. ""Libya's long record of human rights abuses clearly does not merit such a reward.""  And it's true, it would be hard to take any envoy of Gadafy's very seriously on things such as the presumption of innocence, peaceful assembly and freedom of thought - three of the subjects that preoccupied the commission at its last meeting, which was chaired by a Pole.  In fact, when you look at the commission's impressive A-Z of its concerns, from Adequate Housing to Xenophobia, by way of Executions, Terrorism and Women, there does not seem to be any area in which Libya can truly be said to show us the way. As O'Brien admitted this week: ""We still have criticisms of Libya on human rights and foreign policy grounds. But it is moving away from being a pariah. Libya will be judged by its actions.""  Only a year ago, for example, on the 32nd anniversary of his military coup, Gadafy released dozens of political prisoners, an act applauded by Amnesty International. One of them, Dr Omran Omar al-Turbi, had been arrested on suspicion of membership of an opposition group called the National Front for the Salvation of Libya and held without charge or trial since 1984. A most generous and celebratory gesture on Gadafy's part, but little comfort to hundreds of remaining political prisoners, many of whom, Amnesty reports, have also been held without charge or trial.  Naturally, in the absence of a free press, and with Gadafy's ""purification committees"" ever on the qui vive for seditious thinking, it is hard to know just how far Libya has moved away, in O'Brien's words, from being a pariah. But I would put it at around two inches. Pick any line from the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the chances are that Libya, or at least Gadafy, its Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution, takes a contrary view.  Article 9: ""No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile."" See above. Arbitrary arrests without trial remain a Libyan speciality. Article 18: ""Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."" In Libya, as the International Federation for Human Rights (an NGO granted special consultative status by the UN) reported earlier this year: ""There is absolutely no scope for freedom of opinion, thought, assembly and association... The government has subjected opponents within the country and abroad, as well as their families and relatives, to harassment, pressure, threats and physical liquidation, in addition to the widespread resort to the demolition of houses as a form of reprisal.""  Article 21: ""The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government..."" Not in Libya, it shan't. The Libyan League for Human Rights, based in Geneva, points this out from time to time. There has not been a free election in Libya since Gadafy came to power. Earlier this year the league wrote, once again, to the UN's outgoing human rights commissioner Mary Robinson, informing her of more prisoners of conscience and objecting to Libya's membership of the Commission on Human Rights. ""The Libyan League for Human Rights is deeply concerned by this 'laissez faire...  laissez aller' attitude on the part of the high commissioner.""  But Libya is not the only oppressive state to enjoy membership of this most easy-going of clubs. There are absolutely no criteria for entry. Many gentlemanly pariahs, entirely unabashed in their pariahdom, also participate in the earnest debates about gender equality, or enjoy the anti-colonial lectures delivered by their fellow pariahs. Syria, which was censured by Amnesty this week, having sentenced a human rights campaigner to five years' imprisonment, is part of the five-person bureau (headed by the chairman) which runs the business of the UNCHR. It is the bureau's responsibility to decide which countries, or subjects, should be subject to investigation by a UN rapporteur. And contrariwise, of course, which countries should not be so inspected.  If a Libyan takes over the chair next spring, he will find himself discussing liberty and fraternity with delegates from, among others, Guatemala, Algeria, Malaysia, Sudan and Zimbabwe - the last, a country for which Gadafy has a particularly strong affection. With such a motley membership, requiring such respect for cultural diversity, it is no wonder that when it comes to censuring the grossest violations of human rights, such as mass murder in China, unanimity so often escapes the commission. You have to see these things in context. Who, for example, is to say that the treatment of young offenders in Scandinavia is any less of an outrage than the stoning of a woman in Africa? Between them, the demands of cultural relativism and wily negotiating by the worst abusers, ensure that the work of the commission on human rights is so incoherent as to be almost worthless.  If the commission had any impact on human rights, if it evinced the faintest desire to be taken seriously, the emergence of Libya as its figurehead would, indeed, be a scandal. In its current shape, there is absolutely no reason to deny Robert Mugabe's boon companion his moment in the sun. At least, under a Libyan's chairmanship, the 59th session of the UCHR should be free of the ghastly, the unforgivable taint of neo-colonialism. <B>How Archer can be rehabilitated</B>  <BR>Martin Narey, director-general of the prison service has reassured us that, far from receiving special treatment, Lord Archer's Sundays at home in Grantchester, contract deals from his cell, job at a theatre in Lincoln, and permission to drive himself back and forth in his own BMW are an ""absolutely normal"" preparation for a return to civilian life. And who could deny that Lord Archer's sophisticated modus vivendi must demand a different kind of preparation from that required by the lowlier sort of lag? Unless his prison routine follows the schedule outlined below, he may never again be able fully to resume his place in society. 1. A third-rate Picasso to be placed adjacent to the prisoner's chamber pot, to prepare him for return to priceless art collection.  2. Sundays with Mary (planned to form part of society's retribution) to be replaced by drives around Shepherd's Market (map to be supplied if necessary) to prepare him for a return to civilian kerb-crawling.   3. Meetings with senior Tories ASAP, to ensure smooth return to campaigning for job as mayor of London. Fact-finding tour to NYC optional.  4. Elderly femme fatale to volunteer for congress in NCP car park, to prepare prisoner for return to customary sexual relations.  5. TV interviewer to be invited into prison, allowing prisoner to practise bullying and lies.  6. Ermine robes to replace prison clothing, as preparation for House of Lords, other inmates to be reminded that the occasional nod or bow will assist in Archer's gradual reintroduction to civilian life."
0,"Remember, the newspapers commanded, as if one might have forgotten - one minute's silence in Britain at 1.46pm. And after so much commemorative noise, some quiet for the dead of September 11 came as a decent pause in a frenzy of competitive emoting. On television, at least. Outside this office both pedestrians and traffic were pressing on; indoors it was impossible to say whether people were attempting a silent tribute or just being quiet. The purpose of the two minutes' silence when it was introduced in 1919, on the first anniversary of the armistice, was that the survivors of the great war remember their ""great deliverance"" from carnage. Appropriately, the commemorative silence conjured up an actual silence: the moment that gunfire stopped on the Western Front, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, 1918. George V sent a message to the people of the Commonwealth, asking that for two minutes they suspend normal activities and that ""in perfect stillness the thoughts of everyone may be concentrated on reverent remembrance of the Glorious Dead"". There were so many - between nine and 13 million, to which were later added the dead of the second world war, that even now, most of us on Remembrance Day comply with   King George's request, and focus on the loss or sacrifice of others.  Yesterday, unlike many of those whose personal testimonies of loss have now become familiar, I could not associate the attack with any personal friend or acquaintance. My mental images, each time 9/11 is mentioned, are those familiar obscenities - the first plane going into the World Trade Centre, and the thought of the agonies inside that plane: the moment Mohamed Atta thought he was going to paradise.  So elsewhere, presumably, his admirers must have been celebrating. Anniversary contributions to the letters page at the British website of the Islamic group, Al-Muhajiroun, suggest that in some quarters, joy was unconfined. ""I live in Norway and I love Osama bin Ladin"", writes one young man. ""Tomorrow is 11 September, happy day birthday for it. Happy day, 11 September. I hate Americans."" The website organisers thanked him for his contribution: ""Indeed, we must all support our Muslim brothers and sisters under attack"".  Like most British newspapers, the site beseeches those who log on to ""Remember"". Unlike them it does so with the jaunty mnemonic, ""Remember, remember the 11th September"", illustrating the injunction with continuous footage of the planes hitting the towers. Once you have seen this, the choice   of this moment of atrocity as a focus for sombre contemplation is almost perverse. This is slaughter, not deliverance. Should the principal moment of remembrance be the instant of the assassins' triumph?  As with the designated silences for Princess Diana, the Queen Mother, and more recently, the murdered children from Soham, yesterday's imitation of the armistice silences was the sincere expression of a desire that terrible loss or tragedy should be recognised with a commensurately dramatic exhibition of public grief. Some lingering awareness that not all tragedies should be remembered equally is still reflected in the length of silence to be enforced. For the Queen Mother, two minutes of BBC radio silence were ordained, reduced to one for listeners to Radio 1, out of respect for their limited attention span. One minute was considered sufficient for 9/11 - half as much as is awarded to all the combatants of the first and second world wars.  But inevitably, as moments of silence become like rows of twinkling nightlights, condolence books, mountains of teddies and Cellophane-wrapped flowers, the routine national response to death or murder, their ostentation undermines the impulse behind it. Phoney or coercive shows of grief will end in tears. Earlier this year, Celtic football supporters not only refused to observe a silence for the Queen Mother; they booed.<B>Why are fox fans so selective?</B> At Westminster, where the government is currently postponing a fox-hunting ban by rehearsing all the arguments for and against the sport, Professor Andrew Linzey, a cat lover and senior research fellow in theology and animals, has reminded MPs that cruelty to animals is one of a ""cluster of characteristics"" identified in the violent and anti-social. One of James   Bulger's killers, he points out, had been involved in cruelty to animals. Clearly, if we cannot ban foxhunting, then, we should certainly be debating whether we want a royal family composed, to the last prince, of potential sociopaths. Linzey will be dismayed to hear that such sinister disregard for animals extends far beyond the muddy, bloodstained world of Camilla Parker Bowles. Only this week, the Sun reported, a dead badger lying by the side of a road in Somerset was desecrated when - in what was described as a ""callous act"" - workmen painting road markings continued a white line right over its body. A Somerset council spokesman promised to investigate. ""This is totally unacceptable behaviour"".   Indeed. What might such people do in the future? We may pride ourselves on our donkey sanctuaries, we may cherish David Attenborough and a programme called Animal Hospital, but not until Rolf Harris fronts Animal Funeral, in which roadkill is disposed of with dignity, safe from the attentions of potentially deviant road painters, can we truly call ourselves a nation of animal lovers.  Here, surely, is a cause worthy of Linzey and his supporters once they have banned fox-hunting. A dead, cute furry animal is still a cute furry animal and thus a priority for our care. Sympathisers with the factory-farmed cows, pigs, and turkeys whose tortures constitute such a valuable part of the food chain may feel that sentient   creatures might be a more deserving cause, but as the Commons hearings are demonstrating yet again, sentimentality rather than suffering is what motivates the most vociferous animal lovers.  If suffering really counted, then the discomfort of millions of battery chickens would, of course, take priority over the interests of a few thousand stressed-out foxes. If sentience was more important than class, then anglers would be as much a target as Parker Bowles and her mates. In reality, the anti-hunting campaigners go out of their way to insist that anglers are safe from interference.  Naturally, a disproportionate interest in fox welfare is not, by itself, an indicator of mental weakness. On the other hand, my    research suggests that it is one of a cluster of characteristics that often leads to bizarre, inconsistent or downright speciesist thinking. If the Commons fox fans are truly concerned for animal welfare, where is their ""I'm a Cockroach Get Me Out of Here!"" campaign on behalf of the scores of maggots, stick insects, caterpillars and many other insects which have just been callously squashed, groped and eaten by much larger and more terrifying varieties of vermin, purely for the pleasure of 12 million depraved television viewers? Do the programme's traumatised snakes and hunted piggies count? Or must they, like the badger, first grow fur, then be killed and have white lines painted over them, before anyone starts to care?"
0,"Has a glass ever looked more half-full? And yet, at the same time, more half-empty? Those of us who have doubted Tony Blair's wisdom in applying this form of efficacy-evaluation to the political mainstream can only concede its aptness to the work of the national lottery commission, and hang our heads. For it is, in its way, a perfect summary of the lottery outcome.  On the one hand the glass is half-full: Branson, the crown prince of gittishness, has lost. On the other, the glass is half-empty: Camelot, a practised gang of profiteers, has won. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, do you Tone? Well, you do actually. That little tear glistening in the corner of one of Branson's eyes, as he took in the tragic scale of this abrupt fortune-reversal, was the funniest thing since the death of little Nell.  Then again, the revival of Camelot's fortunes must be terribly distressing for New Labour. It is only five years, after all, since the first waves of revulsion caused by Camelot's surging, £1m-a-week profits had Blair and his shadow cabinet queueing up to denounce Camelot and promise their own, cleansing reforms. ""Camelot has a licence to print tickets and another to print money"", objected Jack Cunningham, then shadow heritage spokesman, who went on to describe the operator as ""another private monopoly set up by a Conservative government"".   In his celebrated ""People's Lottery"" speech, Tony Blair confirmed that he would open bids for a non-profit-making operator in 2000, ""so we can release more money for the benefit of good causes"". He pointed out that ""No other country in Europe runs a private profit-making lottery"". Meanwhile, Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary, declared that Labour would make sure that, ""the lottery serves the people"". He said: ""The government promised that the lottery would benefit every man, woman and child in Britain. Instead, the distribution of money has become a joke.""   Since when the joke has got progressively more side-splitting. In fact the story of Labour and the lottery is, in some ways, even more comically terrible than that of Labour and the dome. Labour had not, in opposition, set its face against the dome. And where the dome builders were culpably vainglorious, the lottery commissioners seem to have been plain thick. The great similarity between these two calamities, of course, is that no one of political consequence is going to be held accountable   for the mess.  Just as the dome emerged as a natural disaster, a force of nature no man could possibly have tamed, so the awarding of the lottery licence is already being portrayed as a task so impossibly huge and complex - think of all those awesome piles of papers! Think of all those big sums! - that we should be grateful that anyone has been found to run it at all, even the beastly old monopoly we all despised back in 1995.   Like the genesis of the dome, the selection of a lottery licence will turn out to be so Byzantine a procedure that its complexities can never be satisfactorily explained. We shall never know, for example, why Smith chose to fill his spanking new quango, the national lottery commission, with five people who so consummately lacked any sign of having the ""wider range of knowledge, experience, and expertise"" that this body was supposed to ""bring to bear on lottery regulation"". The emergence of Dame Helena Shovelton will remain, for ever, a mystery.   Perhaps the commission's task might have been easier had it received more bids. But when the deadline fell, it had just two to consider: one from the fat cats, one from the Cheshire. Branson, recently dubbed Sir Richard by Blair and appointed to Smith's creative industries taskforce, would describe winning the lottery as ""the most important thing in my life"".  Why did he want it so? Not, we know, out of ""self-glorification"", because Branson has decided to sue Tom Bower, his unauthorised biographer, for supplying this explanation. But if not self-glorification, then what? The simple desire to do good? Possibly. Then again, a job as Britain's Lord Bountiful could not   adversely affect Branson's other interests, all of which depend on the bearded person of Branson for their successful branding.   Far from instilling doubts about his motivation, the potent Branson brand seemed to appeal powerfully to the commission's chairman Dame Helena and her band of Shoveltons. So much so, that when the dame announced in August that neither bid would do, it was Branson, alone, who got a second chance, a piece of favouritism which would have most toddlers reeling with sympathetic indignation. Branson exulted that his success would make it ""worthwhile being born"".   Camelot, having been everywhere obituarised, successfully sought a judicial review. At this point another cabinet minister might have disbanded his commission and started again. Smith did not. In court, his commission defended itself on the grounds that its process had been like ""an architectural competition"", in which the People's Lottery had produced a building that was ""very nearly there"" (a claim which hardly conforms with this week's revised ""risky"" verdict). The judge, as we know, disagreed, describing the commission's behaviour as ""conspicuously unfair"", ""unlawful"" and ""an abuse of power"".    Astonishingly, Dame Helena did not instantly resign. Quite the opposite: she defended her decision, and was, even more incredibly, supported by Smith - who presum ably believes that ""conspicuously unfair"" conduct is something that might afflict anyone. Only after a week did Dame Shovelton resentfully agree to go, attributing her departure - in a very dome-like way - to ""media vilification"".   Her four, equally conspicuously unfair colleagues (for the judgment had been unanimous) chose - presumably with Smith's blessing - to remain. It must have been obvious to Lord Burns, Shovelton's successor, that the commission was now irredeemably discredited as well as none too bright - but thanks to the earlier prevarication and mistakes, there was now no time to replace these incompetents.  The appointment of new commissioners, Lord Burns said, ""would delay the process by several months ... the risks regarding that are much greater than the risks in carrying on"". Well, we shall see. Burns will just have to hope that a spokesman for the People's Lottery was being honest, in October, when he said: ""We have absolute confidence that Lord Burns will be fair and impartial.""    Branson is not famed, however, for shrinking from litigation. On the contrary. According to Bower, Branson considered seeking a judicial review back in 1994, when he was first refused the lottery licence. This week he was already asking ""do we or do we not go to court?""   If he does go, then the referral of this extraordinary mess back to courts will be no more than the logical continuation of a saga which seems, in the absence of any competent leadership from those nominally in charge, to have been settled from the start, by the wrangling of professional lawyers. The commission made its initital ""conspiciously unfair"" decision with the approval of the treasury solicitors. This was overturned in court after successful argument by Camelot's QC. Lord Burns' deliberations have been overseen by the city firm, Freshfields, which has also, by coincidence, previously worked for Branson, Camelot and GTech.   And, some may think, why not? Given a choice between Shovelton and Smith and these brainy solicitors and barristers, which would you choose? Wouldn't it be simpler and quicker, given the obvious shortage of suitably qualified public figures, if we just abandoned the pretence of democratically elected government, and appointed a bunch of tip-top lawyers to do the job instead? Then you think of Lord Falconer and Lord Irvine, Lord Grabiner and Lady Kennedy - and remember, that's exactly what Blair is doing. It's just that he hasn't quite finished.

0,"There is nothing like a party conference for reminding you that politicians are not as other men and women. It is not only, as Tony Booth remarked this week, that politicians are now under the control of androids intent on world domination - the strange otherliness of our leaders is evident in so many other ways, from the curious ""tough on smiles, tough on the causes of smiles"" expressions Labour ministers adopted for this conference, to their peculiar use of the English language. Does anyone apart from politicians (both conservative and modernising), use the word ""prudent""? Does anyone else, even when speechifying, say ""I say in all frankness...""?  On the subject of drugs, the current administration becomes almost baroque in its expressions of horror. Keynoting away, Blair raged against the ""drugs menace"", and the drugs industry - as he put it, ""the most chilling, evil industry the world has to confront"".   Even outside the conference hall, any mention of drugs can be depended on to work our modernisers into a passion of denunciation. They never talk about the need to restrict drug use, or discourage it, or understand it, but must always refer to ""the war against drugs"", for all the world as if this were a simple, Good versus Bad conflict in which we are all - except for the doomed druggies themselves - eager combatants.   Presumably, the lurid language is supposed to convey the extremity of the problem - invariably depicted as a grubby stew of crackheads, playground zombies, dead people in toilets. Before his conference speech, in an interview with the Mirror's Paul Routledge, Tony Blair explained why he wants to extend drug testing of ""people who are arrested and charged"". ""Did you know,"" Blair said, ""that in some areas 50% of people who are arrested have drugs in their system? I don't know about you, but that petrifies me.""   We must hope he does not decide to extend the scheme to people who are invited to receptions at No 10, or some of his most modern guest lists might be decimated. Drugs, as some bishops and even some opposition politicians, are aware, are not always, indubitably a ""menace"". You don't have to like them, or take them, to acknowledge that rather a lot of people are doing so now without sliding into the vileness of the gutter and thence into a criminal life from which they can only be rescued by the ludicrously named czar and his legions of drug-testers.   But maybe Tony Blair is more innocent than the Bishop of Edinburgh. Maybe he is not, in all frankness, aware that much, if not most, of the modern British creativeness, from Britpop to Britart, to British fashion, with all of which his government so longs to be identified, is the work of artists who have had drugs in their system. Some of these creative people, such as Noel Gallagher, the No 10 invitee, are brazen about it. Some, dashingly, write novels and make films about it. Others, though more discreet about their part in the ""drugs menace"", feel no sense of shame, or stigma.   Cool Britannia, as Labour used to like to call it, is drug fuelled. Maybe testing should be extended to all those who pass through the doors of   London's Groucho Club? But if the war on drugs is to be thoroughly prosecuted, it must venture still further, into the recesses of uncool Britannia. We already know, thanks to It Girl Tara, Lord Freddie Thing and the Parker Bowles son, that drugs are as much a feature of junior upper class life, as they are of gangs on sink estates.   A recent report suggested that 43% of sixth-formers at independent schools have tried drugs, principally cannabis. They simply do not believe it is harmful. Perhaps they have concluded that their parents suffer more obvious ill effects from alcohol than from drugs. For middle-class people, many of them with impressionable children (people not wholly unlike the Blair family), also play their part in the evil industry. Successful lawyers, financiers, businessmen, government lobbyists - all, otherwise, of the utmost, Blairite probity, are at it too - seemingly convinced that theirs is a recreational habit,   which will not end up with car crime and a compulsory blood test. It may not be easy to persuade them, or their world-weary children, otherwise.   When Tony Blair talks about his war on drugs - all drugs - it's hard to imagine to which constituency he is appealing. Too many people now appreciate that there are differences between hard and soft drugs and yet more complex differences in individual susceptibilities to the same drugs. Some people can't stop drinking and smoking, either. Even those of us who have been robbed by drug addicts might feel that our interests would be better served by an end to prohibition, or partial prohibition, than a futile and costly ""war"".   Blair's bellicosity cannot disguise the fact that his scheme is wholly unrealistic. Why does he want to test people? ""We should be looking at the whole question of bail for cocaine and heroin users,"" he told   Routledge, ""because the evidence is that if people are put on bail they just go back to crime to feed their habit. Far better to get them into treatment."" Treatment in prison? According to some estimates, half the prison population has a drug problem. It would be like drying out alcoholics in a brewery.   The explosion in drug abuse and drug-related crime is alarming, and a severe challenge, but it cannot be seen in isolation as the preserve of a weak-willed underclass and nothing to do with Brit Award winners, models and other modern-approved personalities who don't try to conceal their drug use. Increasing numbers of establishment figures - doctors, editors and police officers among them - are now arguing for the decriminalisation of soft drugs. If Blair is to wage all-out war, he must purge these collaborators and appeasers from his acquaintance. The next Cool Britannia party might be just him and Ann Widdecombe. Enjoy"
0,"Few of us, I think, would rejoice in having a person in Batman suit for a father. Particularly when the twerp in question has a record for harrassing the mother of two of his children and was allegedly overheard, more recently, bragging about the prodigious number of women to have enjoyed the favours bulging to one side of his Batman knickers. And yet Jason Hatch of Fathers4Justice has got himself quite a distinguished following.  Yesterday, in these pages, Hatch and his comrades were even likened to the suffragettes. Who obviously missed a trick in not going in for fancy dress. For although F4J's children's party costumes are sometimes deprecated by those who go on to approve its campaign, it seems unlikely that anyone would have warmed to the men, even taken much notice, had they performed their various feats in civvies. In ill-fitting, babyish outfits that contrived to make them look more little-guyishly plucky (or creepy) than oikish, they elicited support and admiration from the most unlikely places.   Bob Geldof, meanwhile, thinks them ""great and brave"". One of our leading young historians urges them on. Even the law-abiding Daily Mail can't resist this nifty new angle for getting one over on women, whose intransigence has apparently created ""these men driven to desperate measures to get their stories heard"".   Although one could easily get the impression that the main reason for the stories is to get the desperate measures on telly. If we didn't know, from numerous interviews, that Hatch has the interests of two of his children at heart, his penchant for sneaking up, or into, forbidden places might look more like a hobby than a cause. In another era, perhaps he and his mates would simply have gone out poaching or ratting, grumbling about bloody women along the way.  Today, for men who crave camaraderie and thrills but can't afford to go shark-fishing or bungee jumping, Fathers4Justice presents itself as inexpensive, all-male extreme sport, with the added frisson that comes of its also being a crusade and a covert operation. If only more of its members were still cohabiting, it would be a brilliant way of getting away from her indoors. ""Could you change the baby, dearest?"" ""Sorry love, the lads are expecting me on Clifton Suspension Bridge. Where's my Batman suit?""   (Actually, it seems that Hatch, last seen acknowledging the crowds from one of her majesty's ledges, is already in the doghouse. Gemma Polson, the mother of their seven-month-old daughter, has reportedly left him, and says: ""Fathers4Justice has taken over his life. He had told me he was going to give it all up - but then he goes and does this at Buckingham Palace."" If only he had chosen angling.)   Naturally, the ambitions of Fathers4Justice go beyond seeking satisfaction for its premier activists. On its website, the organisation introduces itself as ""a new civil rights movement campaigning for a child's right to see both parents and grandparents"". Which would not be such a bad idea, if the rights in question weren't going to be enforced by warring adults. And there is, it turns out, a reason why F4J is not called P&amp;G4J. In practice, ""parents and grandparents"" turns out to mean a ""dad's army"" which the organisation has been, as it puts it, ""mobilising"" to fight the authorities which support ""recalcitrant mothers"".   Remarkably little evidence is produced to account for this declaration of war. While it is true that some mothers behave vengefully and deny their children's best interests, there is nothing to support the view that such behaviour is either prevalent, or officially approved. On the contrary. A new government green paper, ""Parental separation: children's needs and parents' responsibilities"", notes that most ""non resident-parents"" have weekly or more frequent meetings with their children. It finds that in around 90% of cases, child contact arrangements have been agreed informally by separated parents, of whom, more than 80% profess themselves happy with the arrangement. This does not, in short, conform with the F4J blighted vision of ""a nation of children without parents and parents without children"".   In reality, where there is dissatisfaction with the arrangement this is often because the resident parent - usually the mother - thinks there has been too little, not too much, contact with the the father. If F4J's main concern is genuinely that children should see both their parents, it has launched its dads' army at the wrong sex.   Compared with the number of men who say they want but are denied contact, says Gwen Vaughan, the chief executive of Gingerbread, ""there are far more fathers who have no contact with their children whatsoever"". The men have dropped out of their children's lives. ""The idea that mothers are bleeding fathers dry and refusing them access is certainly not the main picture that we see,"" she says. ""They would like more, not less, supportive parenting involvement from their ex partners.""   If Fathers4Justice is happy to rest much of its case on anecdotes told by individual, often justifiably embittered members, it is surely reasonable to point out that there are many other stories to be told, in which mothers heroically put aside their personal feelings about unreliable, abusive, violent, or possibly criminal former partners purely for the sake of their children. There are more in which fathers, for all that they claim to have their children's interests at heart, use the courts to prosecute a feud with an ex-partner.   Since children are not, as Lord Falconer has pointed out, to be divided up like CD collections, it is not terribly surprising that when these cases go to court many more parents profess themselves unhappy with the outcome. They must have been pretty unhappy before they got there. Those of us who have never been through one of these ghastly battles like to point out, the more piously the better, that such parents really ought to put personal animosity aside. But if they can't, the courts will have to do it for them; occasionally deciding that shared parenting, in this battleground, may no longer be the best outcome. Even so, where parents go to court for contact, only 0.8% are refused. But this sort of objection is unlikely to make much difference to the F4J men's approval ratings, at least while mothers seem so reluctant to dress up as cartoon figures and throw purple condoms at people.   Still, we can agree with Mr Hatch and his gang on one thing: the children's interests should come first. Which means all the fathers in themed romper suits must get down from the walls immediately, stop showing off, and behave nicely. And what goes for them goes for everyone who has been encouraging this silly nonsense. At their age, they really should know better.  Back on song, Blair tries to woo us back Whatever the TUC felt about the content of Mr Blair's address to them on Monday, they should surely feel flattered to have been the beneficiaries of what seems to me to have been, if not one of the great Blair speeches, certainly a hint that we may expect, come conference, a return to glorious, shameless form. The glimpse of a Blair in full song was there not only in his bold reworking of Shakespeare - ""I come here to praise Warwick not bury it. To advocate social partnership not belittle it"" - but in a plangent bit of phrasing that seems to be his very own: ""Even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back.""  Assuming Mr Blair did not copy this off the inside of a greetings card with a little bear on the front holding a pale blue balloon and saying ""Sorry!"", it suggests an intriguing new shift in his rhetorical style, from the visionary who gave us a ""new young country"" to a sadder but wiser kind of guy who hopes we can learn to love again.  A bit like Steps in Since You Took Your Love Away: ""I need to find a way back, And I don't know if I'm strong enough ... You took your love, oh baby, no I need you."" Could Blair's TUC phrase even be a quote from one of his own, as yet unpublished, songs? ""Even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back, ooh yeah baby,    Even if we used to disagree, There's nothing I can do about Iraq, I'm sorry baby ..."" Can't wait."
11,"It has been clinically proven that acupuncture actually works. Medical research always puzzles me, especially in the arena of pain relief. The centrepiece of the ""God, it really does work, that hocus-pocus"" research was that it altered the parts of the brain responsible for pain management, in some cases reducing pain by up to 15%. Immediately, I'm thinking: a) How do you quantify a 15% reduction in this area - by a 15% noise reduction in ""ouch""?; and b) It doesn't sound much, does it? You wouldn't buy ibuprofen that claimed to ""reduce your headache by a statistically significant but still not very large amount"". It's bound to be good for business, this news, and I couldn't be more glad for its practitioners. I've known for years how effective acupuncture is. I've been to a guy who packed me off home with a needle he'd forgotten sticking out of my head, like a Teletubby. I've been to another guy who punctured somebody else's lung by accident, and had to resort to regular, western medicine and call an ambulance. I told my mother, who also visits this guy, and she just shrugged and said, ""Well, if you're sticking needles in people, mistakes like that are bound to happen."" This is how slavishly loyal you get to an acupuncturist, once you realise it really works. He could puncture my lung any day.  Still, they have a bad reputation, I believe, for two reasons: first, all alternative medicines are bracketed together; second, the people who visit them are often seen as flaky, self-indulgent individuals, who don't actually have anything wrong with them, other than a simmering sense of malaise that comes from having more money than sense. In fact, alternative medicines are as different from one another as any of them is from conventional medicines.  In the line of journalistic duty, you understand (I don't have more money than sense, oh no), I've been to a homeopath and a naturopath, a pranic healer and a colonic irrigator (these two in the same week; imagine the cleanliness of my innards by the end of it). I've done Australian flower remedies and the Bach sort, and been Ayurvedic'd to within an inch of my interior life.  Much as I distrust the information that comes from one person's experience only, I still think it worth sharing my findings: any benefit derived from detoxing is entirely to do with the fact that you're not allowed to get drunk while doing it;   homeopathy really is hocus-pocus; pranic healing makes my blood boil (with rage, not for cleansing purposes), but otherwise has zero impact; colonic irrigation is for people with eating disorders whose whole week will be lifted by the entirely misleading loss of a pound or two; flowers are for idiot hippies; and Ayurvedic doctors keep a drawerful of antibiotics for when people are properly ill. Oh, and acupuncture really works.  The reputations of people who swear by alternative therapies are grounded in facts rather than prejudice. Few of these treatments have had their worth tested in clinical trials, so the patients must, by definition, lack scepticism and sense. But there is more than logic at play when you feel your fury rise at the Cherie Blairs of this world getting tangled up with the Carole Caplins. When you opt out of conventional medicine, you are saying one of a number of things. Either ""there's nothing really wrong with me, and the doctor will just laugh""; or ""I'm a hypochondriac, and am only interested in consulting someone who definitely won't be able to tell me whether I am dying or not""; or ""I invest a lot of energy in a nebulous quest for inner purity, because I'm selfish, and consequently my life lacks meaning.""  Whichever statement applies, the whole business is, ethically, worse than opting out of the NHS and going private - at least then you're still following the conventional formula ""Am ill, would like to be better"". When you opt out in favour of a homeopath, you engage in exactly the same manoeuvre of buying yourself out of the nationalised system but without even the excuse of a decent illness. And yet (this is a bit sweeping, but true) the people who do frequent alternative therapies are the same people who would reject Bupa out of hand on lefty grounds.  An instructive parallel would be sending your child to an expensive school in which the tyranny of knowledge had been jettisoned in favour of learning to make trousers out of leaves. Just because it's daft doesn't mean it's not the political equivalent of Harrow.  And now I've talked myself out of ever going back to the acupuncturist, on the day I see my first concrete evidence, beyond the abatement of pathetic symptoms, that it works. How irritating."
11,"It's time you were married,"" said the man in the park this morning, while my dog tried to impregnate his without so much as a white wine spritzer. ""Marry a rich man,"" he continued, ""that way even if you're apart you'll be rich."" Now, I don't take him particularly seriously - he also thinks girls with their bra straps showing are asking for it, and he has a curious objection to words that begin with vowels, such that he adds an H to them. But it's instructive, in any discussion of pre-nuptial agreements, to remember the model from which most of our prejudices derive: once you've married some sap of a man, he has to keep you for the rest of your life, regardless of any subsequent break-up or bad behaviour on your part.  Even in a time before women's wages crept up to approximate men's, this scheme rarely held sway. The person shelling out to a former spouse will be the person with the most money; and that person will also, inevitably, have superior legal advice.  Study after study has found that men who divorced in the 60s and 70s, a time when you could fairly assume them to be the greater earners, were far better off afterwards than their ex-wives would ever be. The fear of being skanked financially by your spouse, in other words, is irrational and always has been. But then, so's vagina dentata and it didn't stop us making a phrase out of it.  A related injustice against men is the sperm banditry whereby a woman will entice Boris Becker or Mick Jagger, say, into a sperm-yielding situation, have a child, then make him pay through the nose for the next 18 years, while she has a load of facials and laughs about him to all her friends.  That situation happens very infrequently indeed. I think it might have happened precisely twice - with Becker and Jagger - requiring as it does such a massive differential of income to make it worthwhile for the woman that only superstars need really worry. Yet these cases enjoy an awfully high profile, as if they were legitimate cautionary tales, and everyone should be on guard for a nubile schemer trying to make a fast buck.  Nothing, though, underlines the culture of inter-gender mistrust quite so well as the rise of the pre-nup. These are curious documents, signalling the financial intent of each party should the worst happen to their blessed union.  As such, they are wholly misleading, since they are entered into in the spirit of generosity, and consulted in the spirit of deep rancour, but they're probably fairer for that. Legally, they're pretty watery, since they operate only as guidelines for the judge, and are not binding.  A survey conducted by Smile, the internet bank, found 46% of respondents would undertake a pre-nup and would like it to be legally binding. Family lawyers report a 50% increase in these documents, though that sounds more dramatic than it is, given that the number was very small to begin with.  In America, where their use has been widespread for longer, their import has grown. In California, for instance, a pre-nuptial alimony waiver has always been overturned on the basis that it was against state law. You might just as well sign an agreement saying your spouse didn't care if you hit him on the head with a spade, and then attempt to use that as a murder defence.  In the recent Pendelton v Foreman case, though, the alimony waiver was upheld. State law no longer trumps the pre-nup in matters of spousal support, though I guess the spade defence would still be a bit ticklish.  The people who believe in marriage are assumed to be society's idealists. In the face of all evidence to the contrary, they believe a relationship can last forever. Even if they half-know it's not forever, they are prepared to suspend their disbelief in pursuit of happiness and excitement, just as you do when you go on holiday, even though in your heart you don't believe planes were designed to go up in the air like that. Friends and family will buy into it because they appreciate and indulge the grandeur of the gesture.  But the gesture is only grand because it is inclusive - excluding your income from the deal is like doing all the vows apart from the fidelity one. And the beautifully instructive thing about the pre-nuptial agreement is that it really does show modern marriage for what it is. It is not forever. It is not even a statement of romance, unless you can square with romance the suspicion that your beloved will one day squeeze you till the pips squeak. It is a party, like any other party, only with more poached salmon.  And while conservative opinion will blame just about anything for the institution's ignominious tumble - from the pill to divorce laws to ""women's lib"" - what really, finally did for it was money."
11,"There are three ways in which John Kerry can weather the intern storm. The most obvious is to make it be not true. He could say ""I did not have sex with young Alex Polier"" and have that actually be the case. As this rumour was hatched on the Drudge website, which was responsible for the first Lewinsky stirrings, the temptation is to believe it utterly. But you know, gossip websites aren't always right. Or he could get one more mile out of his Vietnam vet status. (The third option, since you ask, is to squeeze another dram of goodwill out of his handle - commentators call him ""the new JFK"", but skim over the vital point that it's only because his middle name is Forbes.)  The second is the most interesting path: a straight pitch of infidelity against martial honour, to see which triumphs. Intern shenanigans and military service are the two Arthurian tests of American politics - misdemeanour in either area is always credited with the power to bring a candidate down, though time and again this has proved not to be the case, or only indirectly.  Now, neither fidelity nor bravery is all that useful, on a practical level, in running a country. The first suggests self-denial, altruism, a long-sightedness and commitment to the principles of honesty and deferred gratification that are totally at odds with aggressive first world capitalism. The second combines altruism with reckless self-endangerment and the privileging of physical instinct over rational judgment - qualities that aren't going to do anyone a power of good in a situation room.  The importance of these two notches on the CV of the psyche is mainly symbolic. The immutable importance of sex and death transcends a candidate's position on Medicare payments for the highest tax bracket; his (and I use the pronoun advisedly) ability to forgo the first and risk the second attest to his govern-worthy strength of will. He pulled the sword out of the rock (but didn't impale).  The problem - and here Kerry hits paydirt - is that most presidential candidates didn't go anywhere near Vietnam, for the simple reason that most are rich, and the best way to avoid the army is to have a lot of money. Bush Jnr draft-dodged with the aid of a family friend, who busted him into the Texas Air National Guard, despite an aptitude score that sounds like a Michael Moore joke. Clinton went to Oxford. And Quayle went somewhere not dangerous and nowhere near any communists. If you were going to make any political point out of military service, it would surely be that laying down one's life for America is a poverty issue rather than one of honour. If you balk at the sight of the skiving super-rich, then do something about the system that lets them get away with it. While you're there, redistribute their wealth. Don't just sit there and hope they'll do the right thing.  Furthermore, there are far more important lessons about presidential suitability to be learned from how a candidate has behaved vis-a-vis military action - how did he vote on Iraq? Afghanistan? Was he pro- or anti-Vietnam, as an idea? These clues are no less than axiomatic to world affairs of the next four years; and yet it's fair to say that both left and right are more interested in dressing their guy up in mental khaki, then standing back to see how authentic he looks.  This is politics at its most primitive; it harks back to an era when a ruler would prove his credibility by lancing someone through the guts. The nation rewards this gladiatorial scion with quasi-Christian rhetoric - I've seen Kerry described as a ""son of Vietnam"" (with Oliver North, as it goes) who was ""baptised in the Mekong delta"".  Genuine veteran status gives you more than a certain glittery something - it makes you both father and son of the nation. The war doesn't need to be just; your views don't need to dovetail with your service; all that matters is that you were there, and hopefully were awarded a few medals - though frankly, the US army seems to give those things away like sweets. (Kerry got three, but technically he has none after throwing them at the steps of Congress in an anti-war protest.)  Ultimately, voter assessment of a candidate's worth is becoming more literal-minded: all action, no talk. And candidates have no problem with this, Kerry's current catchphrase being: ""Measure me by my life. That's how you know that nothing I'm saying to you is just words."" This is the clearest signal yet (clearer even than Babes against Bush, the soft-porn Democrat website) that political rhetoric - which I use non-pejoratively to mean words strung together to form thoughts - plays an ever-dwindling role in the overall process."
11,"This year I had the good fortune to celebrate Canada day in Winnipeg. I thought it inappropriate to get in on the parade, so mainly I just joined them from the sidelines in thanking Canada for the fact that all the shops were closed and all the young people were drunk. I didn't get the impression that people were taking it all that seriously; a willowy adolescent called Georgia told me it was just an excuse to drink beer and paint their faces red and white. ""What a quaint little people you are,"" I replied. ""Imagine wanting to paint your face red and white."" A grown-up man named Ned with a red and white face insisted that they only chose July 1 because they wanted a special day slightly before the Americans' special day. That isn't true; it's actually to commemorate the British North America Act of 1867, whereby the nation became a dominion of ours. I think Ned was engaged in his own little game of ""lightly mock the foreign person"". Which is fine with me. While these two Canadians (who now, for me, represent all Canada) were blase about the historic day, various other signs large and tiny betrayed a certain tension about this nationalistic display. The tiny one first - a cafe that would normally have been open had a sign up saying: ""We wish you a beautiful day off to reflect on nationalism, Canadianism and global imperialism."" Naturally, it didn't direct our reflection, but I got a hunch that they weren't intending us to go, ""Yay! I can't wait till the munitions shop opens again, so I can subjugate more countries!""  Canada's national paper, the Globe and Mail, chose the day to celebrate Canada's fine immigration record, tolerance and tireless fight against racism and prejudice of all kinds. They had an in-depth profile of a family of very successful Vietnamese migrants, a survey that found Canadians overwhelmingly (97%) in favour of racial diversity, and a leader celebrating both. It's a close call, this one - if the feature of themselves of which Canadians feel most proud is their tolerance, then what better day to celebrate it than Canada day?  But at the same time, nationalism is nationalism - you cannot make a statement of a country's greatness without tacitly implying its superiority, if not over all other nations, at least over some of them. Its values are coarse and random; trying to unite 28 million people under a flag can't be done with subtlety or consistency. Using a national day to celebrate tolerance is about the best possible use you can make of a national day, but it still lacks the humility and complexity with which tolerance might reasonably be associated.  You can get away with that kind of thing, though, when you live next door to America where, by happy coincidence, I arrived on July 4. They also have parades and paint their faces. They don't celebrate tolerance, as such; instead, they have watermelon-eating contests which, as a choice of activity to symbolise the core values of the nation, demonstrates a hitherto unexpected depth of self-awareness.  Most noticeable about these celebrations, on the streets and in CNN July 4 commentary, was the visible police presence. Newscasters reminded citizens hourly of the possible threat posed to them by al-Qaida. In one way, this dovetailed neatly with the central theme of the day - it's a relatively short trip from independence, through isolationism, to ""everyone hates us"". And plus, they're right, a lot of people do hate them. At the same time, I can't help thinking how much more stable the international community would be if they went back to using this special day for its original purpose - the celebration of how faltering, greedy and inadequate the British are. I think we could handle it. Instead, the upshot was a day dedicated to those natural bedfellows, jingoism and paranoia, with a watermelon adding up to an unlikely threesome.  That said, historical fidelity is by no means any insurance against the sabre-rattling patriotism. The Northern Irish Orangemen, marking their special day next week (I only hope I can get back in time), stick slavishly close to the historical event commemorated on July 12. It was the routing of James II by William of Orange; nothing about its antiquity seems to put a dent in its status as a good excuse to firebomb Catholics for kicks.  These three events are, you might have noticed, discussed in ascending order of badness. It is far worse to kill people than it is to paint your face and listen to some municipally sponsored funk. But even the yodelling patriotism engendered by football and such is tempered by its fleeting relationship with measurable sporting skill, is outward-looking and has its fortunes rocked by those of other nations. Both the Canadian disquiet and the American triumph underlined the fact that the celebration of nationhood in a vacuum is inherently uncivilised. The world is too old for stuff like this."
1,"Somewhere at the heart of government sits a blueprint specifying a date for the euro referendum. It is May 1 2003. Naturally, it's only one notion. There are other possibilities, including no date at all. Nothing like a decision is near. But this is the one on which most work has been done. I've discussed it with ministers and officials. It dispels the idea, urged in a letter to the Guardian by an important group of Labour sceptics, that public services are far more important than the euro, and the referendum must be put off until they're fixed. That could yet prove to be the opposite of the truth.  Start working back from May 1, and you hit other deadlines. The campaign proper is reckoned to need two months. March and April would see it hammering away at full intensity. Before that, a preparatory campaign would unfold, in parallel with the parliamentary process of getting a referendum bill passed into law. Little problem in the Commons here, but the Lords would be another matter. That's where all those - Lord Owen, many Tories - whose strategy is to stop a referendum happening would make their last stand, filibustering about campaign finance and the wording of the question. The planners are allowing four months for that, which means starting in November - which means, in turn, settlement of the five economic tests by October, maybe before the party conference.   This is an adventurous programme, faster than most people are aware of. I happen to believe that, unless it's   adopted, there will be no referendum in this parliament. It would maximise the political opportunity, and just about enable the whole euro deal, including notes and coins, to be completed before the next election. But that's a personal opinion. The relevant political fact is that important ministers are very sure they can hold and win a referendum within that time, or by autumn at the latest, and thus secure an historic achievement for the Blair administration.   No other scenario offers such an incontestable triumph. This is painfully obvious from the first month's activities of this year, in which ministers have set themselves life-or-death tests they have no hope of conclusively winning. Two weeks ago, Stephen Byers staked his future on ""the quality of your travelling experience"". If this hasn't greatly improved, he said, he would deserve to be punished at the election. On Sunday, Tony Blair vowed more explicitly to fall on his sword if the NHS isn't ""basically fixed"" by the next election. ""I am quite happy to suffer the consequences,"" he said. ""I am quite willing to be held to account by the voters if we fail.""   These were the words of desperate, perhaps complacent, certainly pious politicians. They used the strongest language they could think of to reflect the perception of failure in which they fear they're now engulfed. They wouldn't have spoken thus unless they thought they could deliver. Yet, far from launching a supreme national effort to make the trains run on time and the hospitals im prove beyond recognition, these promises are likely to inaugurate an era of dismal politics.   For the pledges are never provable. It's quite conceivable that the railways will respond to three years of consistently enhanced investment. It's possible that the NHS will deliver improved statistics in some parts of the country, or even nationwide. But the argument about their meaning will never end. Last week was an acrid foretaste of the years to come, with ministers pointing to abstract figures that purport to show improvement, and other people - patients, families, doctors, nurses, Conservative politicians, bloody-minded journalists - deploying the singular human disasters that will be available every day of the week to show the opposite.    What we have to look forward to from a political era staked entirely to public sector performance is, in other words, a battle of the spinners more utterly bewildering than ever before. Even if delivery does improve, there'll be myriad stories that say otherwise. Even if 86% of people still claim to be satisfied with the NHS, everyone knows this figure is distorted by gratitude,   loyalty and fear of complaining, for everyone has experiences, of delay especially, that make satisfaction entirely inappropriate. The politics of this will turn far more on the general credibility of the parties than on the specific funding each purports to offer: because funding promises seldom link into the felt lives of voters. The claim that the NHS has been ""fixed"", or that travel is now ""improved"", will remain profoundly disputable until the day of the election.   There's not much joy in that for anyone. It's vital that the investment goes on, but the political excitement it's capable of generating is limited. For Mr Blair to be expelled from power because he's failed to fix the NHS is no more credible than him being kept in power because he can show a couple of thousand more acute hospital beds and a useful rise in nurse recruitment. Essential though better trains and schools and hospitals are, the heart must sink - and the electoral turnout too - at the prospect of three years' futile argument between rival narratives that are both incurably mendacious.   A referendum on the euro will be, by contrast, a clear-cut political contest. For a start, it's something the government promised at the last election. The need for it, to detoxify British politics, becomes ever clearer. The demand for a British decision, one way or the other, becomes more pressing as the years go by, and the weakness of the strongest government in Europe failing to provide one becomes more embarrassing, more subject to tacit peer-  group contempt, with each month that the single currency defies the hostility of those who thought it could never happen and/or never work.   But the case for a referendum is not just to fulfil some textbook idea of decent political conduct. I'm not that crazy. The case revolves round Labour's need for a project the voters can understand, to establish a raison d'tre that has some chance of being manifestly fulfilled. Improving public services does not fill that ticket. It's good work, essential work, work governments should be doing anyway. If it doesn't happen over the next decade, the so-called fourth largest economy in the world will look thoroughly sick. But as New-verging-on-Old Labour's Big Idea, its outcome will be indistinct and its claim on history trivial.   Pace Lord Healey and his friends the sceptic letter-writers, it certainly isn't an alternative to a euro referendum. The two can run alongside. They will need to. Awaiting public-service perfection is just another pretext for never putting the euro to the people. The opposite case is more positive than that. Winning the referendum won't be easy. But it's already more plausible than it was a month ago. It's the challenge a serious party can no longer duck, for the sake of its own standing. Far from the referendum making service delivery harder, it is Labour's only route away from lassitude, denial, and a verdict that says permanently and on everything: not proven."
1,"Anyone who lived through the 1970s and 1980s, to look no further, knows what wrecking meant. Those were decades of constant politico-industrial wreckage. The political culture was one of conflict, in which most people knew which side they were on. There was a government and an opposition, and there were forces outside them that challenged both of them. This was a country in dire economic trouble, the basket case of Europe, a nation at war with itself.  The two decades were not identical. The Callaghan years were marked by savage disputes between public sector workers and industries the public owned, without the faintest regard for the national interest. Wreckage spread through the private sector, culminating in 1978-9 with a winter for which the voters did not forgive Mr Callaghan. The Thatcher years saw similar upheaval, though in a different context. Here was a government taking on the public sector, bashing trade unions, privatising sacred cows, under a leader who did not disguise her mission to wreck much of the economic and political power structure that had been in place since the war.   These were decades of turmoil. The forces of order struggled constantly to maintain it. You could say the political culture was unstable, but not that it was moribund. There were real contests for political life and death. Thus were fought out the last years of the left-right ideological struggle, before the collapse of socialism.    What's startling about the present deployment of the word ""wreckers"" is that it comes out of a quite different sky. The weather is grey, not thunderous. The word most commonly applied to the culture is not conflict but apathy. Apathy, verging on universal scepticism, pervades the body politic. The government may scan the far horizon with the most powerful telescope but cannot see itself in peril. Successive elections yield evidence that the formal opposition party may be dying. This is no longer a nation in the middle of a war between definable enemies. Its political culture is comatose, if not dead.   But the prime minister seems to have a strategy for reviving it, which is by getting his retaliation in first. It is he rather than his critics who wants to create a climate of conflict. Could he be further from James Callaghan? There being no serious challengers, he needs to invent them. There is no meaningful threat from the right, beyond a half-baked nihilistic confusion which, as a leader committed to making public services better, he can easily swat aside. So he discovers threats on the left, likening them to a militant tendency that belonged in the decades long gone.   To any detached observer, this is at odds with observable facts. Reform has been Labour's project since 1997. What's interesting is not how much wrecking Labour's reforms have induced but how little. Take education, the prime interest of the first term. Primary school reform was slow, difficult, contested. It forced a lot of new work on teachers. Curricula, standards, league tables, endlessly shifting demands, all were meat to the enemies of reform. But in the end the work was done. It continues. There was a lot of abrasion, but the output of schools measurably improved. There was no wrecking.   The term may be more applicable to old-fashioned disputes about pay and conditions, which still go on as well. But these are hardly systemic. The RMT union's battle with Arriva is a consequence of the worst of all the privatising ""reforms"" of the Conservative government, which Labour did not change. Closer to justifying the word wreckage will be the prison officers and police, if they fight to the bitter end against the kind of employment reforms that everyone who has ever managed them knows are necessary.   But the other side of the picture is more striking. At the centre of it are union leaders who operate in a context that is different from the old days. The law now makes wrecking difficult. The professional attitudes of many of these leaders have more to do with providing for and keeping their members than with taking political positions. The acme of this style is John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, a thoroughly modern exponent of pragmatic and collaborative industrial reform, who is part of a union generation that would claim to have done much quietly to assist, in the health service and elsewhere, the kind of working changes that have to be negotiated rather than imposed if any real reform is to occur.   This is not the end of the story. A new batch of union leaders await election in key sectors, some pledged to a more combative attitude against the undercutting that private sector employers have brought to public service work. The old ideological certainties are being deployed to fire up the argument against the public-private partnership which the Treasury has proved so rampantly determined to impose on London Underground. Both sides are reeking of blind dogma.   There's still a big difference from the old days, though. These arguments now barely engage the wider public. There is no grand political contest. Everyone wants better hospitals and railways, but hardly anyone cares how these are organised, as long as they improve. To most people, I strongly suspect, the argument as couched by the prime minister, between wreckers and reformers, does not touch a reality they understand. It seems to them to be a sectional dispute, of an esoteric kind, not a large struggle for the future of Britain.   For the truth is that change is happening anyway. The NHS may be less far advanced than schools, but the argument about using private sector resources has been won and lost through force of circumstance. It is happening. The momentum is with it. There will be struggles at the edge. But no trade union seriously believes that this government intends to privatise the health service, any more than the schools. The third way, in that elementary sense, is winning. It is dull, slogging, unglamorous work, producing slow incremental gains, on a track that cannot now be reversed. ""Wreckers"" is a word that seems as anachronistic as it is emotive, thrown into an essentially consensual scene.   So why does Mr Blair think and talk like that? He is certainly a different man from the one who came to power. Years of office have finally, and much to his credit, removed his desire to please rather than persuade. The quick smiles have all gone, overtaken by the gravitas of struggle abroad and at home.   Perhaps it's the fate of all prime ministers to become Manicheans, even when, as this one does, they bestride the scene without a challenge. Evidently Mr Blair needs to believe there are wreckers, as a way of heightening the drama. Also, however, it's a kind of alibi for the ineffable delay that bedevils all institutional reform: a substitute for the billions of pounds which, far more than the expulsion of wreckers, will be needed to fulfil his pledge to make the NHS a health service to be proud of."
1,"All parties agree that ideology is dead. The word is as dirty to Tories battling out the leadership contest as it is to Tony Blair delivering a major speech on public services. And who is not pleased to hear it? But there is a downside.  Having no ideology means that all aspects of politics become more perplexing. Government is complicated to do and just as complicated to understand. The silver thread that linked and determined everything has gone.  When the defining mantra of the left said public good and private bad, and the right said roughly the opposite, politics was easy to make sense of. Now everything is messier.   While the practice of the trade has eventually had no alternative but to recognise this, public understanding has not caught up. It strives to cling to the old simplicities. The mindset of ideology survives the passing of the ideological age.  It's not merely in newspaper headlines, groping for the familiar matrix, that Blairism's plans for public service delivery are seen as a private sector takeover. I bet most people in the country see it that way too.   For this the government is largely to blame. In its first term, feeling its way forward, it wasn't straight. It wanted to please all the people all the time, so it tended to reassure the business world with one spin about innovation and competition, while distracting its own constituency with words that said nothing fundamental would change.  Its attitude to the health service covered a gamut of promises from tough to tender. Its replacement weapon for ideology was ""what works"". But this became its philosophy well before it knew what worked in either health or education.  It knew that what the Tories had done, especially in the NHS, did not work, but was far from sure how to replace it.   There remains a lot of confusion. Important differences are still not widely apprehended, partly because ministers' own schemes reflect the complication of post-ideological government, and partly because producer unions want to make things seem more threatening than they are. Enlisting private sector skills and money to develop surgical centres or improve failing schools is not the same as privatisation.   Very little of the public sector is capable of being run by the private sector in any case. Instituting regimes of competition or ""contestability"", a practice common in the public sectors of France, Germany, Holland and other continental models, isn't an assault on public service principles but a minimal necessity for raising them to the best practice levels everyone is entitled to expect.   Yesterday, Mr Blair got closer to clarifying some of this than he has done before. It was the most important speech he has made since the election.  Though the news line will be his commitment not to ""flinch"" from producer union opposition, the real message was a more cogent invitation than ever before to move out of the ideological box.  Some of the unions believe he is thirsting for a fight, even looking for a demonstration combat such as Mrs Thatcher had with the miners. Actually his words sounded as though they came from the last chance saloon of the British version of social democracy, which has rather suddenly woken up to the danger of its core proposition being seen to fail.   It was a sobering not a militant address. The case it made chimes with the experience of most people who use public services of every kind, which tells them that while more money is absolutely necessary, it is not necessarily sufficient, and that reform is essential if delivery is going to improve.  This was an inaugural moment for the second term in another way as well. It put into operation the vow of plodding, responsible realism with which Mr Blair said he would replace the ever deceptive spinning that was the leitmotif of 1997-2001. As such it sent three signals.   First, the government has no single plan for public services. There is no Great Blueprint, the temptation towards which it was lured in the first term. Compared with some of its first-term rhetoric, the glorification of the private has actually receded.  There are different answers for different problems. If more than half of local education authorities are described by Ofsted as either fairly or very successful, as they are, the sweeping abolition favoured by some reformers makes no sense.  It makes as little sense to insist that only NHS units may tender to run the new surgical centres just because they are being set up as a supplement to NHS hospitals.   A senior trade unionist told me yesterday he was sceptical of ministers' ability to get down to the detail of reform. They were, he said, more at home talking about, and endlessly revising, their fancy institutional structures than with the tedious practicalities.  He also regretted the adversarial - anti-union - subtext that seemed to have made its way into the discourse. But Mr Blair avoided that. His real subtext was that, at a time of peace and high employment, no task of government is in greater public demand than making essential public services, the base material of a functioning society, work properly.   Second, it is without doubt true that only a social democratic government has a chance of doing this.  Only the party with an incontestable belief in the primacy of public services can be trusted to reform their delivery in ways that do not merely profit private business and ultimately deprive the less advantaged members of society.  As a matter of fact, this belief may be a little more widespread than it was: another victory, perhaps, for a new spirit of the times.  Two of the candidates for the Tory party leadership make almost everything of their commitment to health and education, and admit that it was failure in this field that contributed most to the public's hatred of their party at the election.   But the third candidate might yet win. Iain Duncan Smith is the voice of the hard Tory right, which flirts with the minimal state, and much of which favours an American-style approach. With that line, Mr Duncan Smith would be even less likely than Michael Portillo or Kenneth Clarke to win the next election.  But the state of Conservatism makes plain the danger that without visible improvements brought about by progressive politicians the public sector will become the source of yet deeper cynicism and despair.   Third, though, the challenge is in one sense impossible to meet. Blair said yesterday that it was ""as great as any that has faced a postwar government"".  We have to be aware that he has staked everything on outcomes that will, in many people's eyes, never be satisfactory. The famous glass, whether in school or hospital, is always in danger of being half empty.  If the world economy, dragging Britain's with it, faces a prolonged downturn, not even the prudence of Mr Brown will have been enough to preserve the required budget surplus.   All one can say at the moment is that Mr Blair has set out, without glamour or spin, on the defining stage of his engagement with the realities the people most value.  Even that is worth saying, however - and worth supporting."
1,"In Britain there is no debate about an Iraq war because nobody important is prepared to make the case in favour. This is the big change that's become clear as summer ends. The demand that Tony Blair should inform a national argument before committing to a war was originally made out of apprehension on the part of people who didn't want one. They thought he might sweep into Baghdad behind George Bush without a word of discussion. But the demand has been overtaken by events. If debate is what counts, it was won before it began. Opposition has assembled on an imposing scale before a word is spoken on the other side. Fewer than 20% of voters say they would support British involvement. Ministers, previously anxious to satisfy the Americans, have started running for cover from their own people.  In America, until recently, the position was the opposite. There was no debate because nobody dared to make a case against. The Democrats were, and still are, silent. The pro-war case, crudely pushed by Bush and regularly explained by the leading civilians in the Pentagon, kept being made with little counter-attack even in the press. There were doubts, but the cogent articulation all came from the other side. This may have something to do with the poll finding that 69% of Americans are in favour of a military assault on Saddam Hussein.  Things have now changed in Washington, but the US remains the best - the only - place to hear the argument for war. This is as it should be. The US is the only actor that will count, and the only place outside Kuwait and maybe a few Gulf states where there's any significant lust for getting rid of Saddam by this means. If that didn't exist, nobody would be contemplating war, in Britain or anywhere else. Inside the British government, the motor of discussion is in any case not to do with the pros and cons of an attack but entirely with the usual British obsession: how to play the Americans, within the illusion of our special relationship. A bathetic and increasingly ignoble priority, given what's at stake in the Middle East and the world, but none the less the one that Whitehall refuses ever to reconsider.  Listening to the argument in the US, one has to accept it is serious and sincere. It's not all about hidden agendas, though some of those who make it should probably be required to register as pro-Israeli lobbyists.  America, say the apologists, is hugely strong. There's no axiomatic need for the world to remain in thrall to Saddam. We have the means to expel and kill him, and thereby start to turn a resource-rich and educated people from the millstone to the lodestone of the region. For Iraq is not Afghanistan, living in the middle ages. Nor is it Iran, in thrall to militant Islam. With one fell swoop of courage and commitment, we can bring a better life to Iraqis and stability to their neighbours. Seize the day.  Seize it, moreover, for the sake of America's own security. Saddam has seriously menacing biological weaponry, even if one rules out the nuclear. He may use it. He may already be doing business with al-Qaida, and now's the chance to wipe this linkage out. America, the case goes, has a duty to do this, and now, with September 11 still a hideous memory in many minds, is the moment when it can be done. To do it would be a glorious not an infamous assertion of the new world order: a virtuous match between the new global terrorism and the newly unencumbered power that has the means to vanquish it.  Inside this case, though seldom mentioned, is also oil. The price of crude has risen 50% since the war talk revved up, adding to economic gloom in the US, but the war party doesn't care. More on their minds is Iraq's oil-richness. This adds harsh self-interest to windy speculations about ending terrorism, bolstering the belief of those who press a passionate case not just for regime replacement but era change. This war case, as vice-president Dick Cheney showed, is ever stronger in the mind of the president. But now at last it is being countered by voices that matter.  Bush, who detests the challenge of an argument, doesn't like this. Nor does defence   secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who still seems to be pretending that all Iraq discussion is redundant. But I believe what beckons is, at last, a debate of some grandeur about America's role in the world.  Brent Scowcroft started this, and James Baker has followed it up. These are momentous Republican voices. Scowcroft, the first George Bush's intimate security adviser, asked the war party a list of painful questions about what they thought they were doing: who their allies would be, what sort of mayhem they were prepared to wreak in the region, what exactly they thought should follow Saddam. Baker, who was not only Reagan's secretary of state but the heavy hitter sent to Florida to secure the disputed election for Bush Two, surprised his friends by insisting that the UN must have a far bigger role than the White House envisages.  These people aren't against regime change in Iraq. But they're in favour of geopolitical coherence. Henry Kissinger, though typically Delphic in his advocacy, has staked out the same ground against the impetuous ideologues who simply want to seize the day.  This doesn't necessarily make war less likely. But it changes the terms. Coming from within the party, and amplified by other Republicans on the Hill, it poses a major challenge not to Bush's warrior ambitions but to his revulsion from what's called nation-building. What Scowcroft and other elders are pointing out is that things are nothing like as simple as the anti-Saddam missionaries seem to think. To claim, as Cheney did on Monday, that acting is less risky than not acting is nowhere near good enough. The demand now irretrievably on the table is for Bush to recognise that he cannot demolish Saddam without committing to rebuild Iraq, with all the attendant risks. If he wants to embark on this adventure, there's no way it can be done as a short-haul project.  The US, in other words, can't bomb and run, still less invade and run. That's what they hoped for in Afghanistan, where they're already pushing to get out, even as warlordism resumes. After an invasion of Iraq, it would be suicidally unrealistic. The only future, in terms of the Middle East peace Bush claims as the object of all this, requires a US security presence and huge political commitment for years to come.  Yet that runs counter to everything these hard-right Republicans came into office preaching. It envisages a return to the paternalistic American reach of the post-war era. It would be shockingly offensive to a bunch of gut isolationists, many of whom do not carry passports. But the discussion has begun to make things clear. Reality presses inexorably in. Either Bush and Cheney and the rest of the gang will become nation-builders, which they've been telling Americans is a terrible idea. Or they will have to abandon their plan for going to war with Saddam Hussein.  <BR>"
1,"I 've been coming to the United States for many years, and thought I knew it. I studied here, reported here, and have kept the fruit of those connections. I married an American, which surely took me closer to this place, and even more affectionately into its heart. So I possessed most of the materials necessary to read America. Yet it turns out I did not know it. This may be for a simple reason. Until 9/11 and the Afghan war, perhaps America did not fully know itself. What's most striking to a frequent visitor, holed up for a white Christmas in Vermont, is not that America has changed. Everything about the place may remain much as you suspected. But it is all more so. Each virtue and each vice, if vices they can be called, declares itself without the ambiguities of before. I dare to generalise from a small corner. But the shock of this war, I'm guessing, has forced America, all across the continent, to think about itself more urgently: to show itself: to say without complication what it is.  Americans always were considerate. They're now super-caring for friends and neighbours. Wherever they lived, they shared the attack for which history had left them totally unprepared. Three months later, not one   iota of the memory has been stoically sloughed off. The shock reached the depths of the national psyche, and continues to reverberate there. The people still blunder about, unsure why it happened. Their response is to care and share more tenderly, more generously even than they used to.  Americans always were self-confident. The events of 9/11 summon them to greater displays than ever of this singular faculty. There's no whining, no trace of self-pity. Self-sufficiency is second nature. American certainties, so maddening to Osama bin Laden, are redoubled. All that three months have done, after the due period of solemnity, is to liberate the humorous dimension, allowing Garrison Keillor, the great radio raconteur, to make innumerable funny jihad jokes, which show that Islam has been de-listed from the scope of political correctness.  Americans always were patriotic. Flags hung in many yards on the dirt roads throughout the 10 peaceful years I've been coming here. But now patriotism is a far more intense experience. Vermont sends to Washington the only congressman who calls himself a socialist, and has more than the usual quota of plain-speaking residents who retain a low regard for President George   Bush. But their patriotic response to 9/11 is unquestioning. This is a locality with no tourists, and very local local papers. Yet it has discovered the world. When Hamid Karzai was sworn in as head of the interim council to govern Afghanistan, it made the lead in the Valley News, White River Junction, which also had a down-page item on Yasser Arafat's pledge to pay a Christmas Eve visit to Bethlehem.   But I don't take this as evidence of a new internationalism reaching into the obscurest by-ways of America. It shows, though, that when the patria is under threat, Americans can shed their indifference to the world the threat is coming from. In another part of the polity, Washington as much as Vermont, they lose their angst about America's role. America's role is to protect America against all-comers. That's what patriotism means, and it's nothing to be   ashamed of. It is all remarkably simple, the more so for never having been made so forcibly clear before.  Americans, however, as well as being patriots, were also always constitutionalists. And here the change is marked. Even my liberal Vermont acquaintances have only modest dislike for the military tribunals and other weapons against due process that Bush has assembled. They're not rising up against them. Aware of their sensitivities, the government cites Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt as precedents to show that great men are allowed to abolish habeas corpus and free speech when the Republic is threatened. It seems to be enough, in this hour of crisis when Americans see themselves facing a danger their ancestors did not experience.  I don't say that politics has ceased, in this new America. There are familiar arguments about the budget. There is a left and a right, just as there is in Europe, and they argue about roughly similar things, namely the size of the state and the level of taxation and the finer ideological points concerning how best to stimulate a flagging economy. There are big elections in 2002, and each side is manoeuvring for position in the great game of modern politics, which is less about   claiming credit for success than disclaiming the blame for damage wreaked by forces beyond politicians' control.  But in the great abroad, politics virtually has ceased. Over that terrain, America has become easy to lead. Alarmingly so. Even Vermonters who detest Bush are prepared to put their trust in him, because the situation seems to offer them no other course. He vows to get the job done, that archetypal American phrase; and it is clearer than it has ever been, at least since 1945, exactly what the job is.  They talk jestingly about seeing us next year, ""as long as we haven't been blown to pieces"". The implication is that Armageddon could come from either side. But fate, they seem to think, has taken over. America must do what America must do, which is to extinguish al-Qaida from the face of the earth. American idealism, that fickle jade of post-war diplomacy, at last has a purpose everyone can agree on, the saving of America itself. It is not clear what this will mean for the world.  But it's clearer than it has been since Jefferson what the world means for America: safety from sea to shining sea, and maybe not beyond."
8,"No sensible person can honestly believe that New Labour made a corrupt bargain with either Enron or Arthur Andersen.  Since my relationship with the party is that of a forsaken lover, cynics might argue that I would be the last to know. But, from my position of detached ignorance, I assert that there was neither an explicit nor an implied compact between the government and the companies.  I am equally sure that the help that the opposition received before 1997 - both in money and in kind - did not make ministers feel unreasonably well disposed towards the two donors after the election was won. There was no political or legal wrongdoing - at least on the part of the politicians. Their corruption was intellectual.  Labour's involvement with Enron was small beer - though that may be an inappropriate metaphor with which to describe the sponsorship of one of those ghastly champagne receptions which the party organises from time to time. The important relationship was between ministers and Arthur Andersen.  Just at the moment when the new government was worrying about how it could finance the improvement in public services, the mighty firm of international accountants explained how lead could be turned into gold.  The prime minister wanted to believe that the private finance initiative would solve his problems. So the alchemists - who had failed to notice that DeLorean was a crook - were rehabilitated as prophets of the third way.   Arthur Andersen's timing was impeccable. The PFI report was published at the moment when the government wanted both to hold down public expenditure and demonstrate its faith in private enterprise. Recruiting private companies to build and run hospitals was an ideal way of demonstrating that New Labour was business friendly.  Tony Blair actually believed that private management would improve the performance of the public sector. The real complaint against the PM is that, despite the evidence, he still refuses to accept that the simplistic and self-serving Arthur Andersen prescription is wrong.  He defends their conclusion by citing work on the same subject by PriceWaterhouse Coopers, a similarly prejudiced source. At the weekend Stephen Byers told a Labour conference that the government would not allow vested interests to stand in the way of PFI. Does he not realise that vested interests invented it?   John Prescott, following hard on Byers's heels, tried to justify PFI, by announcing that it was simultaneously both the most prudent and the only way of financing hospital building. Neither of   those conflicting claims can be justified.  There was no reason why the government could not have financed a new hospital programme out of public funds. It chose not to. And PFI - like the mortgage schemes with which Prescott recklessly compared it - is a very expensive way to join bricks to mortar.  Most families buy their houses with a mortgage because no alternative is available. Only Labour wilfully increases the long-term costs. A PM who is so proud of reducing the national debt can hardly boast about mortgaging hospitals. To him PFI is more than a financial expedient.   It represents all his hopes of entwining the private and public sectors of the economy into a combination of compassion and competence. That idea comes into the same category as Thomas Hardy's poem about the oxen kneeling in their stalls at midnight on Christmas Eve. It is such a charming thought that we can only regret that it is sentimental nonsense.   It has been a bad week for the reputation of hybrid companies. Edexcel - the exami nation board which sets unanswerable questions - is both a limited company and a charity. Although it ploughs its profits back into education it operates like a commercial company in order that it can respond to the theoretically redeeming pressure of free enterprise.  It now admits that it neglected investment in new technology - the characteristic error of obsession with short-term profits.  And one employee attributes all its mistakes to replacement of ""the education ethos"" with a need ""to compete for market share"". Arthur Andersen and Tony Blair please note.   The PM cannot fail to notice, but he will not change his mind. To accept reality would be to deny the theory on which New Labour was built and by which it was governed. Socialism, in all its forms, has to be rejected and the competitive market embraced.  When the evidence suggests that the pursuit of that general principle produces a worse result than the acceptance of ancient truths, the hard evidence is ignored. It is not the sort of scandal about which the opposition complains.  They are part of the conspiracy. But it is a far worse crime than accepting a few thousand pounds from a crooked energy company and using it to finance a party."
8,"I was, of course, for Gore. In the beginning I was a Bradley man. But as soon as he dropped out of the race, I rallied - like the good Democrat I briefly was - to the party's chosen candidate. Memories of snowy days campaigning with Edmund Sextus Muskie in the New Hampshire primary combined with the distaste I feel for George W Bush and my regret that the Great Republic should be led by such an obviously cornball president. However, after four weeks of waiting for a miracle to happen, I realised that there is at least one benefit to be gained from the vice-president's defeat. The Labour leadership may now take a more grown-up view of America and its politics. The years of girlish infatuation are over. The notion that the US provides the pattern of modern progressive government will not survive an administration that is isolationist abroad and fiscally neolithic at home.  Although I have always been part of Labour's pro-America tendency - star-struck by JF Kennedy when I was young, properly impressed by Lyndon Johnson's civil-rights crusade after the assassination, and devoted to Hubert Humphrey to the point at which admiration and idolatry are difficult to distinguish - I find it hard to understand why, apart from the president's success in winning two consecutive elections, Tony Blair feels such an affection for William Clinton.  The second victory was won at the expense of welfare and medicare - which he was elected to improve. Both are more difficult to obtain now than eight years ago. That is not an example that Tony Blair should wish to follow. Let us hope that, in four years' time, the Clinton inheritance will not prejudice the policies, as well as the prospects, of the Democratic candidate.  In the meantime, President Bush - detached by irresistible ignorance from the needs of Europe - may help us all to take a more rational view of the rapid reaction force. I have argued for our continued commitment to Nato in every Labour forum from local party to national conference. But the alliance is now outdated. It was created to meet a danger that, although real and present at that time, has disappeared.   Without the nuclear sword and shield, an imperialistic Soviet Union might have moved west. But nobody believes that Russia has territorial ambitions that are held back only by the deterrent. Nor will the threat of massive retaliation make the pirate nuclear states think twice before firing off their missiles. Deterrence is a sophisticated business in which the potential adversaries calculate each other's reactions with mordant scientific care. Only superpowers behave in that way.   Nato was necessary but it was, and remains, an instrument of US policy. Successive administrations realised that if Berlin fell, Boston and Baltimore would not be safe. That is why they made (and still make) so massive a contribution to the cost of security. The size of their commitment makes it hard to complain about their determination to control how the money is spent. But we ought to be frank about the result of that determination. It goes further than insisting that the supreme allied commander is always American. They want Europe to pay more. But they still expect Nato to reflect US strategic interests.  President Clinton was hard to persuade that those interests included imposing a reluctant peace on the Balkans. It is easy enough to argue about the propriety, as well as the long-term success, of the Kosovo and Bosnia operations. But it is absolutely certain that President Bush would not become involved in anything that remotely resembled them. If Europe believes that fire-fighting may be necessary in Europe or   Africa, it has to create a fire brigade of its own. If future flames are outside the American continent, Uncle Sam will stay at home and watch the far-off countries burn - confident that they will not even scorch the US.  We cannot expect Tony Blair - or any other European leader with the exception of President Chirac - to say such things publicly. The prime minister is absolutely right to pretend that the election of President Bush makes no difference to what he called the ""special friendship"". But he must know it does. And, if he has any judgment at all, he must also realise that it argues for an even closer relationship with Europe.  That greater integration is demanded by realism not by anti-American sentiment. The US presidents whom I admired most all argued for Britain to become a major force within the fast-track of the union. They used to talk about Europe and America as ""twin pillars"" joined together by what I suppose was architrave-Britain.  It may be too late for that. Being a reluctant European we have lost much of our influence with America. Ironically, the election of a president who is careless of our interests may help to achieve a proper, if not special, relationship."
8,"Tony Blair's willingness to ""pay the blood price"" that the special relationship with America requires goes down in history alongside Ted Heath's promise to ""cut prices at a stroke"" and Jim Callaghan's incredulous question: ""Crisis. What crisis?"" All are united by the fact that each of the infamous phrases was an intentional misquotation. But do not expect an angry Downing Street statement insisting that Tony Blair never used, nor could have used, such infelicitous language. For the notion, inherent in that ugly expression, is a distorted reflection of the prime minister's passion for solidarity with the US. That is why the fraudulent attribution was so clever and so damaging. Heath and Callaghan were traduced in the same way. The fabrication of the prices promise - probably intended at the time to make the Tory leader sound ""dynamic"" - was justified with the explanation that a Conservative research document predicted a rapid reduction in the inflation rate. The fabrication of the Labour prime minister's crisis question - certainly meant to damage him and his government - was defended with the excuse that, on return from a meeting with the president of France, he had suggested that a couple of days spent discussing ways to avoid nuclear annihilation put the breakdown of refuse collection into perspective. The newspapers had, they insisted, done no more than compress long statements into a suitable size for front-page headlines.  In Tony Blair's case, the three-card trick was played rather differently. Michael Cockerell, interviewing the prime minister for a television ""special"", used the offending and offensive phrase in a question. Did standing shoulder to shoulder with America mean that ""the blood price"" had to be paid? The prime minister followed a reflex ""yes"" with the explanation that loyalty required ""commitment"" as well as ""support and sympathy"" - a sensible enough answer in a reasonable world. It is difficult, even with three days hindsight, to imagine what better reply he might have given. ""I would not put it quite like that myself""? Pusillanimous. ""Let us hope it will not come to that""? Evasive. ""I pray that not a single British life will be lost""? Sanctimonious and transparently disingenuous. Blair was trapped.  That is not to say that the trap was intentionally laid. I accuse Michael Cockerell of neither personal animus towards the prime minister nor political prejudice against the government. But there is still something fishy about the entire episode. ""Blood price"" is an idea that I associate with Sioux and Comanches as they appeared in Hollywood westerns in the days when native Americans were called Red Indians. It is not a word that is   likely to spring to a sophisticated television interviewer's mind. Then the prime minister's apparent acceptance of Cockerell's savage language was reported in selected newspapers two days before the broadcast.  I do not suggest that Tony Blair was the victim of a conspiracy. He suffered from what the BBC will regard as high quality marketing. Current affairs producers are as anxious to make the news as to report it. Reading about their programme in the papers is a mark of success. And if the confession or dramatic comment is made public before the broadcast, the notoriety helps to improve viewing figures. I guarantee that there will be BBC ratings fanatics who judge that the blood price story hit the jackpot.  There are two lessons to be learned from the episode. The first is that television programmes - no matter how lofty their format and exalted their proclaimed purpose - are always looking for sensation. Tony Blair's balanced view on what he sees as the possible need to take military action against Iraq is, in televi sion terms, far less attractive than a gaffe, a slip of the tongue or, in this case, the endorsement of an extravagant expression.  Yet paradoxically the trivialisation - for that is what the search for sensation usually amounts to - is sometimes justified. If we do join with America in the invasion of Iraq, British blood will be spilt. Politicians who positively want a war - a category in which I do not include Tony Blair - may not like that stark description of reality, but it is the duty of journalists to expose gory truth.  There are many ways in which to describe President Bush's Middle East adventure - all of them, because of the heart-stopping implications of its consequences, likely to be polarised and prejudiced. The president himself calls it an attempt to deprive the world's worst leader of the world's worst weapons. Who could possibly object to that? We hear nothing from him about the body bags, crippled veterans or the death and destruction that will be suffered by thousands of innocent Iraqis. If we send troops to the Gulf, some of the bodies in bags will be British. That may be a price we have to pay. But it is right to face up to the hard consequences of ""commitment"". The prime minister was conned. But it was a fair cop."
7,"What is fair pay? How jobs are rewarded may always be irrational - an unruly muddle of tradition and notional markets - but the unfairness of low pay in Britain defies any rational or moral justification. Income inequality is the worst in Europe, the minimum wage virtually the lowest. My book on low pay, Hard Work, is timed to pitch at the low pay commission: next month its new head, Adair Turner, will publish his first recommendation on the next minimum wage rise.  The government has kept the minimum wage exceedingly low, at £4.20 an hour. It acts as little more than a backstop against the grossest exploitation. In real terms it is lower than the lowest rate set by any wages council before they were abolished by Mrs Thatcher. It is far less than John Smith's promise of half male median earnings, which would now pay £5.38 an hour. It is not even earnings-linked to guarantee it never falls back. Fairer pay is not part of the plan for achieving Labour's astonishing pledge to abolish child poverty, though without far more radical redistribution in pay as well as tax and benefits, it is unclear how it can be done. Since poverty is a relative measure, reducing inequality is a mathematical necessity.   Plotting on a graph all EU countries' levels of inequality and social security rates shows how countries with similar economies make very different decisions about wealth distribution. There is no iron economic rule that determines how people should be rewarded or wealth shared. Fairer countries (Scandinavia, Holland) tend to do better than the unfairest - Britain. The graph shows that equality is not a matter of ineluctable economics but of long-term politics: decades of social democracy have delivered fairer and more successful economies. It requires voters to want it and political leaders to offer it. Labour does want fairer shares; as Tony Blair said, Labour would have failed if it didn't achieve it. But they also say pay doesn't matter and tax credit subsidies are the best way to redistribute. As long as low pay is topped up by the taxpayer, wages are unimportant: the lower the better, if it creates jobs.   But pay matters a great deal. Ask FTSE 100 directors why their median pay is now £1.5m a year. They admit frankly that it is not the second yacht, but a matter of respect and status. What's true at the top is just as true at the bottom: pay signifies personal worth. It is of primary emotional and social importance. There is no justification for paying a care assistant, a nursery nurse or a hospital cleaner less than they can live on for work that society depends on. If you eat in a restaurant where the dishwashers cannot survive on their wages, you are paying too little for that meal: why should the state subsidise such meals by handing out credits to the dishwasher? The biggest single group of the poor are now in work and their only social problem is that they are not paid enough to live on.   The argument against raising the minimum wage is fear of job loss. At some level jobs would be lost, but no sensible economist can predict at what level or in which sectors. All dire predictions on introducing the minimum wage were wrong. There is little risk of jobs going abroad: low-paid jobs are virtually all in service work and old folk can't be cared for from India. These are mainly essential jobs and have already been squeezed and downsized to their bare bones.   If the government wants to raise the minimum to the maximum sustainable it could bring back wages councils, setting rates to fit not only different industries but different areas, with extra weighting for the south-east. They could fix a far higher ""living wage"" rate for all state employees and those jobs contracted out by the state. (This lifts the going rate without ordering every local hairdresser to pay the same.) The gap between men and women's wages actually grew last year, despite government pledges to end it: as women form 70% of the low paid, revaluing the work women do would make all the difference. Catering, caring or cleaning is only low paid because women traditionally do it. All this will cost money in taxes and in prices and no one suggests it can be done at once: it took Sweden decades of steady social democratic endeavour. But the huge task of abolishing child poverty can't be done by stealth.   So far tax credits are the government's chosen mechanism. They are a brilliant political device, silently shunting significant state funds to low-paid families - £40-£50 a week - without upsetting the CBI, while also making a large chunk of the social security budget disappear into the impenetrable maw of the Inland Revenue. Credits are so complicated that no one understands them, thus conveniently not alerting the rightwing press. Yet increasingly they warp the market, even if that is hard to measure. For example, if they were withdrawn, all low-paid workers would quit work at once and go on to social security, and employers would have to up their pay rates steeply to entice them back again. Tax credits make low pay possible and they subsidise bad employers. If the minimum wage rose and drove some marginal small companies out of business, their work would largely be taken up by bigger, better-run companies.   Topping up low pay for many will always be needed. But as the primary means of abolishing poverty, it is already starting to make pay packets look distinctly bizarre. A typical single mother now draws 65% of her money in credit, only 35% in earned pay, however valuable   her work. If credits are to rise enough to abolish all poverty, the distortion of both the labour market and individual pay packets will become extreme.   Topping up pay has other serious defects, some of which the government tried to hide. Without notifying anyone, they sneaked out on a website on December 23 figures eagerly demanded for months - the take-up rate for the working family tax credits. These show that a third of entitled families were not claiming. Some 600,000 families were losing an average of £42 a week, resulting in a Treasury saving of £1.4 bn last year. (Since it can't be claimed in arrears, that cash should be used exclusively as a bonus for poor families: it could build and maintain many high-quality children's centres.) Experts reckon it extraordinary if any means-tested benefit ever reaches 80%.   Families depending on child tax credits will find their incomes fall off a cliff when their youngest reaches 18 (most children still cost after 18). Families depending on credits will never build up any pension entitlement, which comes with better pay, not better benefits. Wives have been forced to stay home, as their low-paid husbands' credits make it impossible for them to earn. That is bad news, since one in three marriages fail and women who have never worked have trouble supporting themselves later. Above all, the blunt fact is that it is unfair to pay people less than they are worth, less than they can live on. What they are worth is not set by the market - the market is set by the social security system.   But if none of these methods convince, then find others. Not even the right is comfortable with the idea that social progress is at an end and care assistants are destined to live on sub-survivable pay."
7,"Here we go! The golden generation gets its greedy way again. I long ago predicted that when we, the great postwar boomers (vulgarly known as bulge babies for demographic not fattist reasons), reached retirement, we would refuse to give up what we've got. We would have anti-age discrimination laws so that no one could ever force us out of our jobs. So here we go! Or rather, here we stay forever. Talking about my generation, of course we didn't die before we got old. We lived on and we had it all. There never was a more fortunate time to be born in the west than just after the second world war. Consider how doors opened for us: the national health was created in 1948 for us to be born into, the Butler education act made sure we had universal education. Comprehensives followed: I went to the sixth form of one of the first, full of hope and modernity.The Robbins report opened up a swathe of gleaming new plate-glass universities for us, making Keele, York or Essex newly cool, while the Open University caught late-starters. With our new buying power, 1960s youth stamped our tastes on everything: when we were young, the whole world had to be young with us.  Growing up, we lived through the greatest upward mobility ever known within a generation. Born some 70% into manual working families, by the time we married and had children society had reshaped itself radically: now two-thirds of us are middle class, with home-owning as good a class indicator as any. The nation's wealth and average incomes have more than doubled since we left university.Our pensions may have staggered badly in the crash, but after years of hefty tax breaks that form the unseen middle-class welfare state, most people will still retire better off than our parents ever dreamed. We are also the first generation where many will inherit significant sums from home-owning parents - a windfall in late middle age that is hardly taxed for most - money to secure our children's wealth or to blow on old-age boozing and cruising.  That's the majority story; but for the one third left behind, manual workers suffered the tragic loss of heroic high-paid jobs in coal and steel, replaced by low-grade service work. The class divide is harsh on retirement: the right to work forever is a cruel offer to people cleaning floors or laying tarmac, aching for the day they can pick up their pension. If a secret plan lurks to raise the state retirement age, it must never be for them.  But the lucky two-thirds in our generation were always destined to demand the right to keep our jobs if we want. Now we proclaim that 70 is the new 50, just because we say so: by law no one will be allowed to mention our wrinkles, question our memories or notice our hair dye.Size matters in generations. We, the outsize generation, always had the buying and the voting power to impose our will and tastes on all who come after: Brian Matthew's Sounds of the Sixties (SOTS to aficionados) will still be playing Radio 2's prime time Saturday morning slot when we are 90 (and Brian Matthew is about 110). When we need care, we will divert more public money to the best home care or care homes.  The weaker generations that come after us have not had it so good. They have had a more competitive exam-driven education: the more people who take exams, the greater the penalty for failure. In our time, when only one in seven went to university, many more could still make their own way upwards without qualifications: now exams are the only ladder up. The young work harder than we did, the colossal weight of ever higher mortgages falling harder on them.How did it happen that all the mega-growth in national wealth has not given them an easier life? Where now the earnest debates about what to do with all the leisure that new technology would bring? Technology just makes over-work easier. The nation may be rich, but our children have a harder time than us because the wrong political choices have been made. No one ever asked the voters if they would like time instead of money - a three-day weekend, perhaps, instead of twice the income. For them the era of social progress is over: children of blue-collar families are no longer moving up.  Soon the full weight of our generation will fall upon their frail shoulders - less here than in the rest of Europe - but nonetheless, with 50% soon to be over 50, they will work hard to pay our pensions and our care. That is why encouraging us to work longer is in the end a policy that should ease their burden, as well as please many of us. Luckily, it's win-win for both generations.  A third of 50-year-olds don't work: many are pushed out of jobs, some jump with inducements, others are seduced by Saga brochures but may find their pensions fall short. Some retired assuming they'd get another job - only to meet rigid discrimination in recruitment. Most men aged 60-64 used to work, but now half retire before 65.The early retirement boom took off in the 1980s, encouraged by a government trying to solve its unemployment crisis: but too late it found jobs are never a zero-sum game. Losing jobs done by older workers did not create new work for the young unemployed. Economist Professor Richard Layard says the lesson learned then applies now too: more people staying on will have no effect on opportunities for the young, that's not how labour markets work. The US has had anti-age discrimination laws and no retirement age for 30 years: research shows no ill-effect on the next generation. People working longer pay more tax, add to national output and do better drawing their pensions later.  Will offices be filled with forgetful ditherers? The government's overview of the academic research into ageing makes encouraging reading: ""Work performance does not deteriorate with age."" A few older people show a marked falling off, dragging down average scores, but the great majority are exceptionally good employees. Yes, they can master new skills and they ""work hard and more effectively, think before acting, have better interpersonal skills, work better in teams, are less likely to leave, have lower absenteeism, have better motivation, fewer accidents, more experience and better knowledge of their company"".So, not crabby old geezers after all, but precious assets whose memories are organisationally necessary, not fading.  The CBI fears an avalanche of employment tribunal cases with all the trappings of anti-discrimination law. But there is no other way, as the previous code of practice made no impact. Only the law forces culture change. US experience suggests few people do stay on after retirement age - but it does stop people being pushed into it too early.  This will help women greatly: ageism has been a covert discriminator against women. All those returning to work after slowing their careers for children will no longer find themselves branded ""too old"" even in their mid-30s. For this good news, give thanks yet again to a socially progressive EU directive, as ever pulling Britain forwards."
7,"Politicians of all parties have fallen into the unctuous habit of praising the work done by ""faith communities"" without stopping to think. Britain is the most secular country in the world: a BBC poll last week showed that among the young there are more declared non-believers than there are Christians; in all, 43% of 18-24 year olds said they had no faith.Yet this Labour government is introducing great swathes of faith-based education. It leaves most non-believers perplexed. Why should the secular state use tax payers' money to indoctrinate a largely non-believing nation?Remember David Blunkett saying he wished he could bottle the special magic of faith schools? Tony Blair has since then promoted faith schools through academies sponsored by evangelicals who deny Darwin. Two hundred more Muslim state schools are being created. Already a third of all state schools belong to the religions, most of them Christian.What's the magic? It is called selection. One way or another, most faith schools filter out the most chaotic families. If the vicar or the imam has to sign a form saying the family are regular worshippers, that screens out the disaster families - the drug addicts, alcoholics and mentally ill - who have never got it together to go to church. Their children go to the next door school, which sinks under the weight.As one school improves, the other suffers and more hypocritical parents hurry to church to get their child into the religious school. The neighbouring school loses all its best children. Hey presto! There is the faith schools' 'magic'. Religion has become a symbol of respectability to keep out bad kids. How holy is that? All this is backed up by academic research into admissions. To be sure a few church schools don't do this, but they sink down the league tables along with other schools in poor areas - no magic after all.Britain's thriving voluntary sector does a vast amount of good - and some religious organisations do too. Sometimes the church is the only organisation in the worst estates. But some faith-based drug addiction centres, youth clubs and other outfits are naked indoctrination centres - and dangerous.There is good and bad work done by voluntary groups, but the faith groups have no special magic. They do have special dangers, however, with ""charismatic"" leaders causing a high risk of abuse - mental and physical - wherever there are closed worlds of believers. A Muslim council employee told an Islamic debating meeting I attended last week that he had recently visited a Muslim school where girls were not allowed to look out of the windows. Is that magic too?State money should only be spent on secular schools and social services. People are free to believe and practise what they like, but keep God out of state schools and social services."
7,"The eulogies have begun already. Extraordinary things are being written about the Pope for his 25th jubilee this week, yet these are mere aperitifs for the great banquet of adulation undoubtedly to come when the pontiff finally shuffles off his mortal mitre. Extraordinary that even the sane and measured Financial Times comment page yesterday offered a monumental paean of worship. Two popes, wrote Gerard Baker, earned the soubriquet Great in the church's 2,000 year history: ""For his leadership and authority in these challenging times, how fitting it would be if Karol Wojtyla, the humble Polish priest, came to be remembered as John Paul the Great."" This remarkable sentiment comes with the obligatory sneer at his critics that ""the Pope remains, even in his declining years, one of the great hate figures of the self-appointed liberal elites"". Puzzling this conceit that liberals are ""elites"" while the Bishop of Rome enthroned in his triple crown is just a humble priest - but yes, he is a hate-figure and with good reason.  There will be beatifications and adulations for an ultra-conservative Pope imbued with the narrow ethos of the Polish church, now unpleasantly resurgent in all its old nationalism, anti-semitism and anti-feminism. John Paul II will rightly be praised for his unbending opposition to communism and his support for Lech Walesa. It has entered the growing historical mythology that it was the boldness of the west's far right that single-handedly demolished the iron curtain - the Reagan, Thatcher, Wojtyla axis - usefully erasing the social democrats who opposed it just as vigorously.  An irreligious western Europe largely ignores the strange rituals and beliefs still practised by a fast-declining minority. Aged congregations are vanishing and priest recruitment is in crisis. The Vatican is little more than a historic place of beauty, a quaint bygone alongside Japanese Shinto temples or Maori tongue-wavers. It seems eccentric to bother getting hot under the collar about a moribund faith, let alone ""hating"" it. But Steve Bradshaw's brilliant Panorama this week came as a timely reminder.  Visiting the Philippines, Nicaragua and Kenya, he found the catastrophic effect of the church's teaching on contraception causing widespread death across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Everywhere he went he found the church's iron grip. In a Kenyan village where a third of the people were dying, the church had prevented any condoms being distributed. Not satisfied with preaching, the church uses political muscle and, above all, the power of myth. In all three continents, Catholic-dominated communities repeated the Vatican lie that condoms have holes in them that let the Aids virus through. The president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Family, Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, explained that the Vatican's scientific committee had proved it was true - but despite promises, never produced the committee's evidence. Meanwhile, the WHO struggles, and fails, to stamp out this omnipresent untruth.  No one can compute how many people have died of Aids as a result of Wojtyla's power, how many woman have died in childbirth needlessly, how many children starved in families too large and poor to feed them. But it is reasonable to suppose these silent, unseen, uncounted deaths at his hand would match that of any self-respecting tyrant or dictator. It may be through delusion rather than wickedness, but it hardly matters to the dead. It makes the sickly homilies about his simple piety impossible to let pass unchallenged. A largely admiring article on these pages failed to mention Aids at all.  On Sunday he will beatify Mother Teresa. Many years ago, before she was famous, I interviewed her when she was visiting her London convent and we argued about contraception. Couldn't she see the effects of her teaching on the Calcutta streets where babies were born to starve and die in misery? She said that every baby that takes a breath is another soul to the glory of God and that was all that mattered, the creation of souls. Suffering? We are all born to suffer.  All this is dismissed by papal apologists as a sideline, an irritating irrelevance seized on by liberals and feminists as an excuse for attacking Catholics. In the FT, Mr Baker flicks away the question thus: ""There are doubtless excellent grounds for promoting birth control in Africa. But it is no surprise that the head of the Catholic church declined to endorse them."" Failure to ""endorse"" birth control is not the same as aggressively preventing it in the many lands where the church holds sway. The National Secular Society is campaigning to have the Holy See removed from the UN, where it is the only religious organisation represented.  Clashing against the modern world, religions founder on their sexual fetishes. Their high spiritual ambitions are brought crashing to earth by obsession with the filthy human body. Sex always means women, Eve for ever responsible for Adam's lust, for ever in need of subjugation. All the Middle Eastern religions define their identity through fixation with women's bodies - ritual baths, churching, shaving heads, denying abortion and contraception, purdah and keeping unclean women from the altar. This perverted abhorrence of women destines religions to collide with modernity everywhere, for to be modern is to set women free. In the end, Islam, too, will modernise.  Any attempt to stop sex leads to extravagant hypocrisy. It is no secret that a high proportion of both Catholic and CoE clergy are gay, and some of the ""celibate"" are child abusers whose activities were shielded for years by the same Vatican that makes sexual purity the impossible keystone of its identity. It is an odd throw-back to find the temperate CoE tearing itself apart over gay clergy.  To outsiders, it is funny that the Pope has canonised more saints than all those created in the past four centuries. It is less amusing that he has created 201 cardinals, all deep conservatives. Will this gross gerrymandering ensure an ultra-conservative successor? Vatican watchers observe that all popes try it, but the pendulum tends to swing from conservative to liberal and back again. If so, it is possible to hope that a liberal Pope could be as great an influence for good as Wojtyla has been for harm.   Sometimes John Paul II offered tantalising hints of what a good Vatican could do. He campaigned to end capital punishment, though hardly gave it a high priority. He made powerful critiques of capitalism's naked greed, but he sabotaged the popular liberation theology of the Latin American barefoot priests and backed the sinister Opus Dei instead.  East European Catholics are fighting to have God included in the new EU constitution, and ahead lies a major row about whether Europe is confined to Christendom - keeping out the Islamic hordes of Turkey. But for many non-religious EU citizens, the difference between the mullahs across the Bosporous and the mullah in the Vatican might be hard to detect. What matters is keeping private Gods out of the public realm."
7,"After the season of excess come the resolutions - thinner/fitter/nicer. There may also be a nagging sense that it would be good to do something for the community. But what? Most people have a hazy idea of what volunteering might be and may shudder at the thought. Be a Brown Owl? Work in a charity shop sifting old clothes? Wheel a trolley of library books and Lucozade round a hospital? Clean out a canal? What if there is no escape from the blind old man waiting for your visit, a burden of guilt too far?  The immediate manifestations of volunteering may not be 100% enticing to everyone and it is all too easy to alienate tentative would-be volunteers. Finding the right slot for each individual requires experience and sensitivity - and then it may last for life. Done badly, it may put people off for ever. As it is, half the population already does something: another 25% - 11m people - say they would ""if only they were asked"" but no one has.   The government has waxed lyrical about the importance of volunteering, but their record so far is mixed. Millennium Volunteers, for 16 to 25-year-olds has gone well, using mostly experienced organisations such as the Prince's Trust and others. But elsewhere they have failed to use the experience of people who know how to entice volunteers and use them. Politicians always want to reinvent the wheel, eager to badge their own gleaming new organisations, often wasting money and good will.   Volunteering was always fraught. Is it to produce a cheap workforce for things the state can't afford? Or is it to foster community? Should the outcome be the effectiveness of what volunteers do, or the satisfaction and community spirit engendered? In the end it has to be both, yet if matched badly the two functions can conflict.   Community Service Volunteers (CSV), which places more than 150,000 volunteers a year for its £1m grant, looks with anxiety at some government spending. The government has just founded a new organisation, Experience Corps, to attract older volunteers for a walloping great £19m. It funded the new TimeBank for £27m.   Many others in the same field, such as Reach, are asking the same question: why use complete beginners to start Experience Corps from scratch, employing expensive outside PR firms, the Saatchis and a host of those consultants who now increasingly descend upon large government grants? Allowing for all the usual charity rivalries, there is a storm brewing over what government can and can't do well in the voluntary field.    Government does have a crucial role to play but not down at community level. Elizabeth Hoodless of CSV wants them to concentrate on opening up the institutions they run - prisons, hospitals, schools and social services - by setting targets for the number of volunteers each must use. She points to programmes in America where hard-pressed social services have a team of volunteers calling on the family of a child at risk. But here professional opposition to using volunteers is hardening. Half the hospitals use some, the other half use none at all, yet every ward has people who need company, feeding, reading to or taking outside.   GPs who use volunteers for extra home visits have cut prescribing by 30%. Prisons are filled with illiterates needing tutors. Amateur eyes and ears, extra pairs of hands, befrienders, mentors, tutors and helpers would hugely improve most state services - but the professionals need to be forced to make it happen. This is not just to improve the service but to improve the local bond and the sense that these services belong to the community and not just to professionals.   From next September, every 11 to 16-year-old will have to do community service as part of the national curriculum. Many schools will struggle to organise it, with hard-pressed teachers expected to devise and create suitable schemes. It will need seasoned senior volunteers to help schools set up plans, liaise with local government or hospitals. CSV says it and others can do it, using models from the best schools without each school learning from scratch. But the connection between the government and the people who have the experience on the ground often seems to be weak.   The relationship between government and the voluntary sector is undergoing several reviews at once. With large sums of government money now pouring into community schemes, the voluntary sector complains it does not get a fair share and bidding for contracts can be a nightmare. Yet at the same time voluntary organisations fear becoming surrogate government agencies: many large housing associations are now hardly recognisable from housing departments. The problem is how charities can keep their freshness, originality and independence while taking on large slabs of heavily regulated state work.   Figures for volunteers only emerge every three years, so we do not know yet whether government exhortations have helped slow the decline. Most people are drawn into volunteering by a friend or colleague inviting them to join in, not by M &amp; C Saatchi. However, perusing the internet the huge array of opportunities is encouraging. It can include one-off short efforts and brief episodes: it does not have to be a long commitment. It might involve just keeping in telephone contact with a lonely person.   Of the many sites, a good one to start at is do-it.org.uk where you can fill in your postcode and access an array of activities. In my patch I found this mixed bunch: painting frescos in a local day centre, being a business mentor, playing with children in Brixton prison visitors' centre, campaigning for fair trade, working in a Citizens Advice Bureau, mentoring young offenders or refugees, helping in a night shelter, mending electric buggies or knitting tiny clothes for premature babies. Local volunteering bureaux can offer more personalised ideas. Try  csv.org.uk, volwork.org.uk, experiencecorps.co.uk, and timebank.org.uk."
7,"George W Bush has just purchased his party's nomination. Anti-sleaze candidate Senator John McCain is beaten but his charismatic warnings about democracy for sale will still ring out in this election. As Gore and Bush now both head off for another vigorous round of greedy fundraising to buy multiple short, sharp, TV attack ads, campaign money will be a big talking point. But the money that in the end may really count is the money Bush plans to buy the voters with: tax cuts. The question is whether enough of the people can be bribed enough of the time to let Bush buy the White House the way he has bought himself everything else. The Bush message is simple, primal and potentially deadly: money, money, money. Lashings of it, golden promises ladled out at every rally, pouring like a lava flow from his website, handed out in IOU leaflets at every rally with a ready-reckoner to show every taxpayer how much richer they will be through his phenomenal tax cuts. Slashing and burning his way through the whole tax system, he will abolish death tax altogether and let inheritance rip. Crudely this appeal to greed is clothed in the high moral tones of the right: government is essentially evil, so keeping money out of its hands is virtuous. Doing good to yourself by not paying tax is doing good to your country too.  He has whistle-stopped 100 airports.   As everywhere else, in Rochester, upstate New York, bands, Republican dignitaries and some 2,000 people turn out to hear the speech he has been selling from coast to coast. Dapper, slightly simian, too small eyes too close together, he is a feeble shadow of a feeble father. That president without qualities has brought forth a man with only negative qualities and less than nothing in his past history to recommend him. (He seems even worse in the flesh than on television.) ""My priorities are my faith and my family!"" he declares, but the one punch in his every speech is mammon. And why not? The power of money has bought this unaccomplished man everything he has - a place at Yale, a place in the National Guard to avoid Vietnam, an oil business, then rescue by his dad's good ol' boys when it went bust, the Texas governorship and now the greatest slush fund ever accumulated by any candidate, making him the creature of every unsavoury interest including big tobacco and the National Rifle Association.  So is it surprising that his unique selling point, the one that raises the roof in stomping and cheers, is money? He learned these words at his Daddy's knee: ""Read my lips: no new taxes."" But his father lost next time partly because those same lips failed to deliver. This time this Bush is handing out an electoral bribe of colossal proportions the like of which no one has tried before. No doubt William Hague and Michael Portillo will be watching what happens with eager fascination.  His standard speech is larded with untruths: ""Taxes are the highest since world war two when we had 7m men in uniform."" To great cheers he promises to give away the big budget surplus, which currently goes mainly on repaying national debt. ""I know the surplus is not the government's money, I know it is the people's money! It's risky, they say, to give people their money back. I'll tell you what's risky - to leave money in   Washington DC!"" Bush calls himself a ""compassionate conservative"" but on his lips ""compassion"" has a new meaning: ""It's conservative to cut taxes. It's compassionate to give people their money back.""  To be sure he says other things too in his standard text. ""Sharpening the military sword"" is a favourite - a return to the mythical star wars missile shield costing unimaginable trillions. (But where will the money come from?) And education, a critical voter concern in this election. Bush will take away money from failing poor schools and give it to parents as vouchers. He sneers at the head start programme, saying he'll get money back from that too - though its phenomenal success with deprived pre-school children made it one of the few LBJ ""great society"" programmes that survived the Reagan era.  But all that is just a little flannel in which to dress up his shameless main message: money. Can voters, even in a time of unprecedented boom, still be bought with the largest, crudest bribe ever waved beneath their noses? Pollsters and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic always fear they can. In the privacy of the polling booth the offer of a minimum $2,000 in every tax payer's hand is a powerful pull. (Far more, of course, to the already super-rich.) This will be the ultimate clinical trial of what money can buy in a democracy and rightwing parties everywhere will be watching the experiment.  The Gore camp pretends not to be rattled by this. Polls and focus groups show people saying that in these good times tax cuts aren't where it's at. They want better schools, healthcare and infrastructure. Who needs money in their pocket when that money spent collectively can buy the things they know they really, really want. But do they really, really mean it? Gordon Brown and Tony   Blair will be watching this election with equal intensity. If Al Gore wins in November they might gain the confidence to bound into the next election explaining why paying more tax can get the voters more of what they want, ignoring all Tory tax hand-out blandishments. If Gore wins on a No Tax Cuts ticket then that old ""eternal truth"" that voters always vote with their pockets will be exposed. It is a shame this essential message is to be delivered by such a dismally poor candidate as Al Gore. But his one advantage is that Bush is even less attractive, an even more charm-free zone. It will be a flawed electoral experiment, mired in other issues, but it is as good as we shall ever get.  The Gore camp comforts itself: it's the economy, stupid. Voters do not want to risk upsetting this golden moment (though jitters in the markets this week and the coming oil price rise may change the picture somewhat by November). Gore will warn that the American economy could not take Bush's explosive tax-cut cash injection. While Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, will scrupulously avoid comment, the look on his face may be enough to remind voters that he would have to send interest rates soaring to keep inflation at bay, throttling off investment, shooting up mortgage and borrowing rates, strangling growth and employment, plunging headlong out of this magic boom. This is what Mr Brown should be telling British voters too now: higher taxes are a more productive way to dampen inflation than higher interest rates. But will he?  That may depend on whether leaden, dead-eyed Al Gore can make the US electorate sit up and understand that Bush offers poisoned gold. A difficult message to get across in the desperately truncated political language of demi-semi-soundbites. But it will settle for a long time the question of whether money in the hand always out-dazzles everything else."
2,"Summer can be the cruellest season for those whose life is politics. The big cat only has to slip away for a week or two and the mice are soon at play, cheerfully wreaking havoc. Tony Blair has seen the summer curse work its familiar magic these last few weeks: environment minister Michael Meacher would not have allowed himself to be quoted attacking his own government's green record while the boss was in town. But Blair should be used to it by now. In 1997 he had barely cracked open the Ambre Solaire before John Prescott and Peter Mandelson were squabbling over who had been left in charge. (A highlight came when the deputy PM held up a jar containing a crab, telling bemused photographers he had named the ugly crustacean Peter.)  Still, Labour's holiday woes seem rather innocent compared to the summer spectacular being laid on by the Conservatives. They have followed up last year's ratings winner - Leadership Contest, in which an entire parliamentary party does its best to destroy itself in full public view - with a fitful, but enjoyable sequel. Once again, the same motifs have been on display: vicious attacks on one another, profound disagreement on the way forward and a desperate fear of electoral oblivion.  As befits his role, Iain Duncan Smith set the lead. He sacked his ambitious party chairman David Davis while the latter was soaking up the Florida sun, thereby injecting a whiff of civil war into the air just in time for the plotting season. Sure enough, the conspirators have taken the leader's cue and spent the steamy July and August nights scheming.  The Daily Telegraph reported yesterday a plan by 50 Tory young turks, including a dozen parliamentary candidates, to break away and form their own Start Again party. Over swish dinners and via email, the disaffected have apparently shared their collective panic at the Conservatives' seemingly permanent residency of political rock bottom. They are worried by polls that refuse to budge, stubbornly holding them at 35%. Their plan may be mere fantasy at this stage, but they believe a fiscally conservative, socially liberal SAP could do for the Conservatives what the SDP did for Labour: inflicting a painful split, but one that ultimately brings the old party back to its senses.  If that is the threat from the left - most of the SAPs backed Michael Portillo last year - the Tory right is hardly being any kinder. Duncan Smith's replacement of Davis with Theresa May, trumpeted as a gesture of kinder, gentler inclusiveness, was a modernisation too far for Norman Tebbit: ""The politically retarded managers at central office ... seem obsessed with the ethnic and sexual minorities, forgetting that those who share our values will come with us and those who won't will not.""  More insults are on their way from the same wing of the party tomorrow, in a new pamphlet, Paralysis or Power?, from the arch-  Thatcherite Centre for Policy Studies. ""Conservative spokesmen spout 'baloney',"" writes its author Rupert Darwall, a former adviser to Norman Lamont and a veteran of the legendary Conservative research department of the 1980s. Tories have become ""political pariahs"", he says, short on talent or anything else that might make them attractive to voters.  ""The hard truth is that the Conservative party wasted its first term in opposition,"" he concludes. Lest IDS draw comfort from that apparent blame shift on to William Hague, Darwall hurls a rock with Duncan Smith's name on it: ""More than one year into the second [term], little progress has been made.""  The attack has two clear prongs. The first is that the Tories have erred by fretting about style rather than substance, trying to change their tone of voice rather than what they say. As one former Hague lieutenant puts it, in a voice dripping with derision: ""This is the lip gloss and Botox strategy - trying to make Tories look nice.""  Instead, says Darwell, Conservatives have to get to the heart of the matter, fighting Labour on the battlegrounds of philosophy and principle. So far they have mistaken   Blairism for mere opportunism. That is ""a huge error"". For Labour stands on one side of a clear, ancient ideological divide: it believes in the active, expanded state while the right has always demanded the reverse.  That is the second limb of this new critique. Conservatives used instinctively to argue for minimal government and low taxes, but since 1997 they have lost their nerve. ""The Conservatives didn't lose the argument. They stopped making it,"" seethes Darwall. Rather than robustly opposing Labour's lavishing of cash on hospitals and schools as doomed in principle, the Tories have mumbled and muttered that they would do the same but with slightly smaller sums of money. That ""amounts to a Vichy response to Blairism"".  At first glance, this argument should make Blair cheer and IDS sob. For what Darwall is advocating is a platform that would surely send the Conservatives plunging into polling gloom. If the Tories followed his advice, they would tell voters the ""hard truth"" that they will have to pay ""charges for healthcare""; that Railtrack was a perfectly good system that failed only because Labour ministers ""wanted to prove that rail privatisation wouldn't work"" and that lower taxes would rapidly produce better public services. Imagine IDS or any member of the shadow cabinet going on television to argue any one of those cases: they would be eaten alive.   So the fact that talk such as this is bubbling in Conservative circles should be good news for Labour. They want clear blue water between themselves and the opposition and now the Centre for Policy Studies has provided bucketloads of it. This year's budget and comprehensive spending review drew the dividing line, with the government coming out clearly for an active state funded through higher taxes. The centre's paper suggests some Tories are ready to stand on the other side of that divide, loudly opposing, on ideological grounds, such collective action - preferring a low-tax world that leaves individuals with more money to pay for their own private schools or hospitals.  Labour should not be too encouraged by this Conservative return to hardcore market fundamentalism. For the centre's text also serves as a warning. If the Blair-Brown strategy fails, if the river of cash flowing into the public services does not transform the NHS or the local comp into first-class services, this is the argument waiting to be deployed.  In their thinktanks and salons, this is what ideological Conservatives want to do: to reduce public spending from its current level, around 40% of GDP, to 30% within two parliamentary terms. So Labour, which likes to say that now is the ""social democratic moment"" cannot afford to let the moment pass. For now we know what will happen if they fail."
2,"It seems a long time ago now, back in the spring of 2007, when the Labour tribe was so certain Gordon Brown was the right man to lead them they didn't even want a contest for the top job. They had a clear image of the prime minister, he would be: solid, anchored in moral purpose, a heavyweight able to punch the light out of the Tories - and with a reddish tinge which meant he stood, even if not openly, to the left of Tony Blair. That was the Gordon Brown the Labour faithful hoped they were getting 15 months ago. In the past year, many had almost forgotten him, as a different character seemed to take up residence in Downing Street: Bottler Brown, the ditherer who ducked an election and took from the poor with a scrapped 10p tax rate, who could barely speak like a human being and who watched, paralysed, as a 12-point Labour lead turned into a 20-point deficit. But for one sweet hour yesterday afternoon that man was banished, replaced by the Gordon Brown Labour once yearned for. In a speech performed with greater skill than any of his previous efforts - the cadences rising and falling in the right places, the high-volume, machine gun delivery ditched - the prime minister reminded the Labour party of why they had once admired him so much. The improvement began even before he had appeared. In a surprise piece of stagecraft, his wife Sarah came to the podium to rapturous applause - one of several elements yesterday borrowed from the recently-completed US convention season. Like Michelle Obama or Cindy McCain, she testified to her husband's devotion to public service. Her unflashiness, the sense that she has endured tough times as well as good, threw a kind of protective layer over the PM: he gained credit by association. Brown built on that, insisting ""I'm serious about doing a serious job."" Riskily, given that he had just deployed his own wife, he bragged that he had not ""served up my children for spreads in the papers"" - a clear dig at David Cameron, who is often photographed with his family - because ""My children aren't props; they're people."" It was a return to the message he had sought to convey in that distant summer of 2007: not flash, just Gordon. He marched on determined to retake the moral high ground. Speaking more personally than usual, he offered a quasi-apology for the 10p tax error, saying he was ""stung"" by the accusation that he was no longer ""on the side of hard-working families"", vowing that from now on ""it's the only place I ever will be"". He borrowed a line from Barack Obama's convention speech to ram home the point: ""This job is not about me. It's about you."" More surprisingly, Brown cast himself as a Scottish Sarah Palin, adapting one of her signature lines, though with Fife in place of Alaska and Westminster in place of Washington: ""I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted to - and want to - change it."" But Brown's chief effort was to push the image of himself which, during those first three months in Number 10, had begun to take root in the public mind, before it was so pushed aside. He would be ""the rock of stability"". Brown will hope this stems the decline in his standing but that was not his primary purpose yesterday. With talk throughout the conference of a plot against him - the only issue being when, not if, he would be toppled - addressing the wider public was a luxury. He had to win over the hall. He did that by returning to what had been old form, staking out territory to the left of the Blairite project. Never mind that he had been the co-architect of New Labour, a favourite Brown manoeuvre was always to tickle the erogenous zones of the Labour faithful, serving up some old-time religion. Yesterday he did that by promising a ""new settlement for new times"", a shift to reflect the convulsions in the world economy. Now the market would be returned to its rightful place as a servant of the people - never its master. In a sentence which delighted his audience, he declared: ""Those who argue for the dogma of unbridled free market forces have been proved wrong."" All week the conference fringe has hummed with similar sentiments, as Labour folk have seized on the collapse and bailout of the big banks as evidence that the neo-liberal era is over. Yesterday, Brown was keen to ride that wave. So he spoke of freeing agency workers from ""the scourge of exploitation"" and laid into the traders guilty of ""reckless speculation."" That's not language that often passed the lips of Tony Blair. That it comes easily to Gordon Brown was one reason why he was able to remain as Labour's heir apparent for so long. Indeed, he turned to Red Gordon to get him out of trouble many times in the past and did so again yesterday. The politics are not hard to fathom. Brown hopes that by securing his left flank, he can cast himself as the more appealing alternative to any putative rival, who would swiftly be branded as ""Blairite"" and on the party's right. He knows that the trade unions are not impressed by David Miliband: in yesterday's speech Brown sent the message that in any future choice, they should stick with him. That was not the only way in which the he pushed back at those conspiring for his removal. The public ""would not forgive us"", he said, if Labour was to turn inward during the economic storm. This is proving to be one of Brown's sharpest weapons: the claim that to leave the country leaderless during such a crisis would spook the markets and anger the voters. But the moment that caught the attention - as it was surely designed to - was a line officially directed at the Conservatives but with a handy double meaning. ""I'm all in favour of apprenticeships,"" he said, ""but this is no time for a novice."" The TV cameras instantly cut to Miliband's forced smile as the Brown camp knew they would. Not that the Tories escaped a pounding. Brown attacked them more potently than he has managed since becoming prime minister. He won gasps when he quoted George Osborne (not accurately it emerged later) declaring it was financial markets' job to make money out of the ""misery of others"". There was still some confusion on precisely how to attack the Tories: whether to accept that they have changed, conceding that they now have genuinely progressive intentions - but are not ready to support the means to those progressive ends - or whether to argue that the change is merely cosmetic. In the end, Brown did a bit of both. Still, this was more like the great clunking fist Brown had promised and which he had not yet bared. It gave Labour heart that, if Brown carried on like this, he might just rescue himself - and them. There were longueurs in the speech, especially in the middle, during what even his own aides described as ""the policy slab."" And while he offered a sketch of what needed to be done to cure the global financial system, the speech was short on the domestic steps Brown plans to take. The policy proposals were all relatively small-bore: not quite lagging on pipes, but home internet and personal tutors for kids rather than an overhaul of the economy.  Still, it's not on policy proposals that a speech such as this is judged. It's on the intangible, almost emotional sense that lingers once it's over. Brown needed to leave his audience with the gut belief that he's not done for just yet, that he could still come back. He did that yesterday. But it will have been for nothing if it ends there. As one cabinet colleague said, he needs to do that ""every day, every week from now on"". He has to kill off the man he has been for the last year - and bring back the Gordon Brown his party once dreamed of."
2,"You may have drawn up your own list: a catalogue of decisions that have to be made in the year that begins today. Perhaps 2003 is when you finally resolve to change jobs or move house. Maybe this is the year a key relationship has to shift gear. Whatever dilemmas we face individually, we've certainly got a stack of decisions to make collectively. Think of them as an alternative set of new year resolutions: questions we have to resolve in 2003. Here are just six that loom over Britain and the world - and a reckless prediction for each one.  <B> 1. War on Iraq:</B> Any day now Americans have to decide whether to take on Saddam Hussein immediately - or whether to delay a year. The advantage of a wait is nakedly political: it would give George W Bush the glory of victory in the election year of 2004, rather than seeing him peak too early (his father's mistake in winning Gulf War I in 1991 rather than in election year 1992). But delay has a cost too. The world can't remain on hair-trigger alert for another 12 months without getting twitchy and irritable. As the North Korea flap shows, other global crises get neglected when the world's hyperpower is focused so obsessively elsewhere. America's allies almost want to get this thing over with. Also, the longer this   stand-off drags on, the more Bush risks looking indecisive. The argument has raged in the Bush inner circle for a while now, but a decision has to come soon: the winter window will close next month, only reopening in November.  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Desert Storm The Sequel is a 2003 production.  <B> 2. Israeli elections:</B> Voters in Israel have to choose a new government on January 28. If they pick Labour's dovish ex-general, Amram Mitzna, they will be opting for an instant restart in the peace process with the Palestinians. If they re-elect Ariel Sharon, they will be asking for - and will get - more of the same: a military crackdown on terrorism and no more diplomatic activity than the minimum required to keep Washington happy.  <B> Reckless prediction:</B> Sharon wins handsomely, but goes on to rule with a narrow, rightwing coalition that struggles to survive long into 2004.  <B> 3. The euro:</B> By June Gordon Brown has to decide whether his five economic tests for British entry into the single currency have been met. If he says yes, a referendum will prove the biggest challenge for New Labour since the 1997 election. If he says no, Tony Blair's ambition of a ""Britain at the heart of Europe"" will remain unfulfilled.  <B> Reckless prediction:</B> The chancellor has already made his decision. (Witness Brown ally and T &amp; G leader Bill Morris's call for no referendum in 2003.) Brown will declare that his five criteria have ""not yet"" been met, marking the clearest breach yet with euro-enthusiast Tony Blair. It will also postpone (if it was ever going to happen) the handover of power famously promised in 1994's Granita summit: Brown will have to wait for his prize and 2003 may be the year he gets impatient.  <B> 4. A new Europe:</B> By this summer, the EU will be handed a draft of a new constitution, even mulling a new name. Former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing has led a constitutional convention which aims to do for the EU what Philadelphia in 1787 did for the US. It hopes to restructure the union to cope with 26 (or more) states, making the EU the greatest supranational enterprise in history. Blair is said to regard the outcome of Giscard's convention as ""more important than Iraq.""  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> this will be no Philadelphia. Instead of a clear, simple new structure to please logical purists, Europe's leaders will broker and horsetrade their way to a fudge. Britain (and France) will get their way with a strong council of ministers, keeping national governments as key players, with foreign policy and taxation still in national, not EU, hands. Federalists will be happy with a beefed-up commission and greater integration on justice and home affairs. Giscard will not win a name-change to United Europe: it will still be the EU.  <B> 5. Britain's mini general election:</B> On May 1 UK voters everywhere but London should have a chance to cast ballots. Elections for the Scottish parliament and for the Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies are due to coincide with council contests throughout England. Voters have to deliver their verdict on the newly devolved institutions - and to decide whether to give Labour a bloody nose in time-honoured, mid-term fashion. Toughest of all, the UK government must decide whether or not to allow elections to go ahead in Northern Ireland at all. If they do, Sinn Fein is likely to emerge as the largest nationalist party, with anti-agreement unionists enjoying similar success.  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Labour remain in charge in both Scotland and Wales, though   still reliant on coalition allies the Lib Dems. Edinburgh might see a boost for the nationalists, building on their low base of 1999, while in Cardiff, Plaid Cymru fail to repeat their high-watermark performance of four years ago. Both struggle with turnout, especially in Wales where Labour already predicts voter participation of 35% or below. In England, Tories do well - but is it well enough?<B> 6. The future of IDS:</B> In 2003 the Conservatives will have to decide whether to stick with Iain Duncan Smith - or dump him. May 1 could be crucial. If Tories fail to poll above the 33% they won under William Hague in 2001, the IDS-must-go cry will become deafening.  <B> Reckless prediction:</B> On a low turnout, Conservatives scrape to or just above 2001 levels - giving IDS a reprieve. But the whispers and sniping intensify over the summer, leading to full-blown plotting in time for the party conference in the autumn. Eventually the Tories' instinct for self-preservation kicks in, as they realise a failure to ditch IDS in 2003 will leave a new leader only 18 months to prepare for battle with Tony Blair. Expect 12 or more months of Tory bloodletting. Oh, and a happy new year.<B>"
2,"Like a maestro debuting his fourth and finest symphony, Gordon Brown's hour at the dispatch box yesterday should have been his most golden. The climate shines on him more generously than any chancellor you can name. Just days ago Britain learnt that its economy had nudged ahead of France to become the fourth mightiest in the world. Under Brown, the country's accounts have moved from blood red to reassuring black. Yesterday he could brag and boast his way through an astonishing battery of numbers: growth higher than predicted, inflation lower than planned, unemployment at its lowest for 20 years and a deficit in 1997 converted into a £12bn surplus today. Even the usually-ascetic chancellor couldn't resist offering a toast to himself. This fine record was the result of a strong economy and ""our prudent management"". But self-congratulation was not enough for the restless Mr Brown. He quickened the pace, the maestro wowing his audience with sheer audacity. He revealed delights that would have made even his Tory predecessors blush. He slashed through capital gains tax too fast for the scribblers on the opposition benches to keep up. Within seconds he was on to inheritance tax, hacking away at it at such speed that the thing was in ribbons before MPs could pause for breath. Once he was done, the House could only marvel at a Labour chancellor who had served up a budget that could have been written by the Elders of Middle England. They will now pay the lowest corporation tax anywhere and, if they inherit money, only four in a hundred of them will pay tax on it. The reviews on planet Daily Mail should be stellar.  But he was not done yet. Having tickled the New Labour converts, he would soothe the old Labour faithful. ""Something for the heartlands,"" was the tacit message as he announced bundles of cash for education and health. He had pulled it off again. Just as last year he seemed to squeeze a £40bn injection to schools and hospitals into the same budget as a penny tax cut, so yesterday he simultaneously announced giveaways for the well-off and spending for the needy. Within 50 rapid-fire minutes, galloping Gordon had cut taxes, increased spending - and still kept the public coffers in the black. Surely this was yet another Brown blockbuster, satisfying left and right alike?  And yet it didn't quite feel that way. Despite the confidence of the opening,   the final flourish on health sounded oddly defensive. That was because a performance which had begun with economics ended in politics. Far from displaying Gordon Brown as the unchallenged master of the universe lionised in Westminster mythology, yesterday's speech revealed him as a mortal politician - as vulnerable to the gusts of mood and ""events"" as any of his colleagues.  For although Brown's speech lasted less than an hour yesterday, it looked as though it began two months ago - on David Frost's sofa. There, on January 16, Tony Blair sought to cool anger over the winter crisis in the NHS by admitting that spending was too low - and promising increases of around 5% above inflation for the next six years. To the naked eye, yesterday's speech seemed like an urgent attempt to honour that pledge - with a commitment to spend a staggering £69bn on health over five years. (In fact Brown exceeded Blair's promise, pledging cash rises at 6.1% above inflation.)  That may be unfair. An alternative version says Brown and his aides realised more than a year ago that health was too hot a political issue to be handled like the rest of government activity. Where other departments could be told to reform first and receive new money later - and to wait for the Treasury's comprehensive spending review to take its course - health, the Brownies realised, was a special case. Ministers might be able to attack teachers for low standards, witholding extra cash until they changed their ways, but no politician could dare do the same to doctors and nurses. When David Blunkett appears on the Today programme pitted against a teacher, chances are the audience is rooting for him. When Alan Milburn squares off against a cancer specialist, it's the doctor demanding money who wins everytime. Brown's team calculated that they would have to cut through the ""noise"" about resources by breaking their own rules and announcing money up-front first, insisting on reform second. That's why Brown promised the cash yesterday, with Tony Blair launching the major review today.   Either way, the chancellor acted like a conventional politician yesterday, reacting to events rather than shaping them. With most ministers that would be no big deal; but you notice it with Brown - partly because normally he does such a good job of appearing above the everyday fray. Colleagues dislike the way he dodges the flak - ducking when trouble looms over Kosovo or the NHS crisis - but it adds to the aura of Brown as a heavyweight, a grown-up among political juniors. Sometimes he seems more like an emissary from the global economy than a humble British cabinet minister. But that mystique was punctured a little yesterday.  There are three other worries. First,   BMW's dumping of Rover left many Britons anxious to hear Brown say something for manufacturing industry. BMW insists its hand was forced by the strong pound: it made exporting British goods economically unviable. Yet nothing in the Budget hinted at a fall in sterling: on the contrary, tax cuts and increased spending, as promised yesterday, could well have the opposite effect. But Treasury insiders argue that their record of fiscal discipline - turning debts into surplus - should have begun to reduce the value of sterling by now. The fact that it has not suggests not that the pound is too strong - but that the euro is too weak.  A second concern centres on one of Brown's loudest applause lines yesterday. He announced sackloads of money for schools - going straight to the head teacher's cash-box and bypassing the local education authority. That has obvi ous, anti-bureaucratic appeal. But that logic could eviscerate local government, eventually depriving authorities of half their budget and a large chunk of their raison d'etre. This is hard to square with Brown's constant rhetoric about a decentralised, devolved Britain flowering into a rich, civic society.  Finally, the chancellor may come to regret bowing to politics on health. What's to stop other ministers now demanding similar up-front injections of cash ahead of reform? Has he perhaps created an incentive against reform, by rewarding the service with the deepest problems ahead of those which have most improved?  These are not urgent worries. Gordon Brown's centrality to this government was confirmed rather than undermined yesterday. He is still, at the very least, a co-conductor of the Labour orchestra - standing at the front, calling the tune."
12,"I hope that newspapers do not represent public opinion. If they do, it means that we consider the Home Secretary's love affair more important than the resumption of the most deadly conflict since the second world war. On Sunday, the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), already responsible for 3.8 million deaths, started again. If you missed it, you're in good company. The Rwandan army appears to have crossed back into north-eastern DRC. Rival factions of the Congolese army - some of them loyal to Rwanda - have started fighting each other. As usual, it's the civilians who are being killed - and raped and tortured and forced to flee into the forest. Last week, before the fighting resumed, the International Rescue Committee reported that over 1,000 people a day are still dying from disease and malnutrition caused by the last conflict. Nearly half of them are children under five.  Rwanda has already invaded the DRC (or Zaire, as it used to be called), twice. In both cases it appeared to have justification. The Interahamwe militias who had killed 800,000 Rwandans fled there after the genocide in 1994. They were sheltered first by President Mobutu, then by President Kabila. They wanted to reinvade Rwanda and resume the genocide.  But after moving into the eastern DRC for the second time, in 1998, Rwanda more or less forgot about the genocidaires. It had found something more interesting: minerals. Better armed than the other forces in the region, the Rwandan army concentrated on seeking to monopolise the trade in diamonds and coltan. By 1999, according to a report for the UN security council, 80% of the Rwandan military budget - around $320m a year - was coming from minerals stolen from the DRC.  The six African armies that had been drawn into the conflict, their proxy militias and the government of the DRC started fighting a monumental turf war over the mines. Millions of people fled their homes. Thousands were captured and forced to mine or to work as prostitutes. Rwanda's operation was by far the most efficient. It was controlled directly from the capital, Kigali, according to Amnesty International. Even after 2002, when the armies officially withdrew, the Rwandan government left its men in the eastern DRC to continue running the mines. The latest invasion appears to be a thinly-disguised attempt to deal with the militias which threaten its lucrative business.  Though we are rightly exercised about the atrocities in Darfur, it is hard to find anyone who gives a damn about the Congo. This is partly because we are used to seeing the Rwandan government forces as the good guys - the people who first suffered at the hands of the genocidaires, and then drove them out of their country. It's hard to adjust to the fact that good guys can become bad ones, harder still to recognise that they can become some of the world's bloodiest war criminals.   Those who believe that Paul Kagame's government can do no wrong concentrate their attacks on a report published in 2002 by the UN. They allege that it has been subject to power-play between the members of the security council. But they fail to explain why Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Crisis Group, Global Witness, the British all-party parliamentary group and the US state department have all, independently, come to the same conclusions.  The reports produced by these bodies run to hundreds of pages, full of eye-witness accounts and the direct testimony of both survivors and perpetrators. They make horrifying reading. They state that troops have repeatedly raped children as young as three; have sliced off the genitals of women who resist being raped; have forced women and children to work in terrifying conditions in the mines: scores have been buried alive. They have torched villages, looted homes, killed those who resist or those who appear to have helped the other side, and forced millions to flee into the jungle. Most of the 3.8 million have died of malnutrition and disease; but had the marauding armies filled them with lead, they could scarcely have had greater responsibility for their deaths.  The reports give the names of both agents and victims, the dates of the crimes, the precise locations, the value of the stolen resources and the names of the people and companies who bought them. It is very hard to see how they could all be disputed.  Some, such as the Africa specialist and former Guardian journalist Victoria Brittain, have argued in these pages that Rwanda's critics have confused ""the disciplined Rwandan army and the chaotic rebel groups"". While all the armed forces who have fought in the DRC since 1998 have committed atrocities, the Rwandan army is named in the documents again and again. The US state department, for example, summarises ""numerous credible reports"" of regular Rwandan troops ""killing, torturing, or raping"" people in north and south Kivu and northern Maniema Province.  It is not easy to see, anyway, where the moral difference lies between killing people and commissioning others to do so on your behalf. Rwanda's proxy, the RCD-Goma militia, has committed innumerable atrocities all over the east. The Rwandan government is directly responsible for both its formation and its survival. In June this year, Global Witness reported that ""the RCD was put together in Kigali [the Rwandan capital] rather than in the Congo"" and ""still remained highly dependent on its Rwandan backers to finance its military deployment in the region"". Amnesty International reports that the Rwandan army supplied this force with ""rocket launchers, armoured cars, machine guns, light artillery, mortars and landmines"".   None of the reports disputes that the DRC's government in Kinshasa has also been responsible for crimes against humanity in the east of the country. But in much of this region, its writ hardly runs. As a UN report leaked to the BBC last week confirms, Rwanda and its proxy militias are the most powerful forces in the eastern DRC. They control most of the minerals trade and have been involved in almost all the fighting.  Rwanda could have wiped out the Interahamwe - which is now a much smaller and weaker force than it used to be - years ago. As the International Crisis Group points out, ""Rwanda had exclusive and total military control over the eastern half of the Congo between 1996 and 2002 and failed to neutralise and repatriate all its nationals."" Instead, it has repeatedly used its presence as an excuse to occupy the mineral-rich regions. As the British parliamentary group reports, the Rwandan army was often ""located in areas where the Interahamwe did not exist, or were at least 50km away."" In some places, the army has even formed alliances with the Interahamwe to control the mines. Now, using the old excuse, the Rwandan government is dragging the eastern Congo back into war.  It would not be hard for the international community to defuse the world's most deadly conflict. Rwanda is a tiny, frail state, which would collapse without foreign aid, over one third of which comes from Britain. But nothing will happen until we wake up to this dreadful war, and stop pretending that the victims of atrocious crimes cannot also be perpetrators.  www.monbiot.com"
12,"No one could have called ours a raucous household. The passions of our first two years at university were spent, and we were now buried in our books. My work, as usual, was quixotic and contradictory (studying zoology by day, writing a terrible novel by night), Niall's was focussed and unrelenting. He was charming, generous-spirited and easy to live with, but I think it is fair to say that everyone was frightened of him. It's not just that my housemate knew his subject better than his contemporaries, and knew where he wanted to take it. He also knew how to do it. While the rest of us were fumbling with bunches of odd-shaped keys, trying to jam each of them into the lock in turn, the doors kept swinging open for him. Niall Ferguson is now professor of history at New York University, and rapidly becoming one of the most celebrated intellectuals in the United States.  After university we retained an occasional friendship, during which we never quite engaged with each other's politics. I haven't seen him for three or four years, and I'm not sure what we'd talk about today. Our views, which were never close, have now polarised completely. We find ourselves on opposite sides of what will surely be the big fight of the early 21st century: global democracy versus American empire.  His new book and television series, Colossus, is an attempt to persuade the United States that it must take its imperial role seriously, becoming in the 21st century what Britain was in the 19th. ""Many parts of the world,"" he claims, ""would benefit from a period of American rule."" The US should stop messing about with ""informal empire"", and assert ""direct rule"" over countries which ""require the imposition of some kind of external authority"". But it is held back by ""the absence of a will to power"".  Colossus, like all Niall's books, is erudite and intelligent. The quality of his research forces those of us who take a different view to raise our game. He has remembered what so many have chosen to forget: that the United States is and has always been an empire - an ""empire in denial"".  He shows that there was little difference between the westward expansion of the founding states and the growth of ""the great land empires of the past"". He argues that its control of Central America, the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Middle East has had long had an imperial character. He makes the interesting point that the US found, in its attempt to contain the Soviet Union, ""the perfect ideology for its own peculiar kind of empire: the imperialism of anti-imperialism"".  But he asks us to remember only in order to persuade us to forget. He seeks to exchange an empire in denial for an empire of denial.  He forgets those who are always forgotten by empire: the victims. He remembers, of course, that Saddam Hussein gassed his political opponents   in Iraq. He forgets that the British did the same. He talks of the ""genuine benefits in the form of free trade"" granted by Britain to its colonies, but forgets the devastating famines this policy caused in India (he is aware of Mike Davis's book Late Victorian Holocausts, but there is no sign that he has read it). He writes of the ""institutions, knowledge and culture"" bequeathed to the colonies, but forgets that Britain, as Basil Davidson showed, deliberately destroyed the institutions, knowledge and culture (including the hospitals and universities established by educated west Africans) of the colonised.  He forgets too that there was a difference between the interests of the British empire and those of its subject peoples. He writes of the massive British investments in ""railways and port facilities"" and ""plantations to produce new cash crops like tea, cotton, indigo and rubber"" as if we seized the land, exploited the labour and exported the wealth of the colonies for the benefit of the natives.  Strangely, for one who knows empire so well, Niall also either forgets or fails to understand the current realities of America's informal rule. He dismisses the idea that the US wishes to control Middle Eastern oil reserves on the grounds that the US is already ""oil rich"". It's not just that oil production peaked in the United States in 1970. The US government knows that if you control the diminishing resource on which every other nation depends, you will, as that resource dries up, come to exercise precisely the kind of indirect rule that Ferguson documents elsewhere. While brilliantly exposing America's imperial denial, he takes at face value almost every other story it tells about its role in the world. He accepts, for example, that the US went to war with Iraq because ""its patience ran out"" when Saddam failed to comply with the weapons inspectors. There's not a word about the way in which the US itself undermined and then destroyed the inspection missions.  When you forget, you must fill the memory gap with a story. And the story that all enthusiasts for empire tell themselves is that independent peoples have no one but themselves to blame for their misfortunes. The problem faced by many African states, Niall insists, ""is simply misgovernment: corrupt and lawless dictators whose conduct makes economic development impossible"". ""Simply"" misgovernment?  This is a continent, let us remember, whose economies are largely controlled by the International Monetary Fund. As Joseph Stiglitz has shown, it has used its power to run a virtual empire for US capital, forcing poorer nations to remove their defences against financial speculators and corporate theft. This is partly why some of the poorest African nations have the world's most liberal   trade regimes. It is precisely because of forced liberalisation of the kind Ferguson recommends that growth in sub- Saharan Africa fell from 36% between 1960 and 1980 (when countries exercised more control over their economies) to minus 15% between 1980 and 1998. The world's problem, Niall contends, is that the unaccountable government of the poor by the rich, which already has had such disastrous consequences, has not gone far enough.  The timing of all this is, of course, appalling. As the United States has sought to impose direct imperial rule in Iraq, it has earned the hatred of much of the developing world. But we should never underestimate the willingness of the powerful to flatter themselves. Unaccountable power   requires a justifying myth, and the US government might just be dumb enough to believe the one that Niall has sought to revive. My old friend could get us all into a great deal of trouble.  But even he doesn't really seem to believe it. His book, above all, is a lament for the opportunities the US has lost. It is, he admits, so far from finding the will to recreate the British empire that the world could soon be left ""without even one dominant imperial power"". What better opportunity could there then be to press for global democracy?  <B>"
12,"This is the question which people ask themselves before almost every presidential election: why, when the United States is teeming with brilliant and inspiring people, are its voters so often faced with a choice between two deeply unimpressive men? I would have thought the answer was pretty obvious: because deeply unimpressive men continue to be elected. This year, the American people have been instructed to elect one again. Almost every powerful progressive voice has told them not to vote for the progressive candidate, but to vote instead for The Man Who Isn't There. Ralph Nader may stand for everything the Guardian, the Nation magazine, even Noam Chomsky, claim to support, but all these voices - indeed just about everyone on the left - have been urging the voters in swing states to choose John Kerry.  Their argument, of course, is that Kerry is the only candidate who can knock George Bush off his perch. He might be about as inspiring as a parking lot on a wet Sunday in Detroit, but his vacuity is better than the president's aggressive certainties. The contest is so close that if even a few thousand people vote for Nader rather than Kerry in the swing states, it could win the election for Bush. This is why Republicans have been giving money to Nader. So Americans should vote for the Democrats in 2004, and worry about the wider failings of the US political system when the current president is safely out of the way.  And their argument has merit. Bush has already launched two unnecessary wars, threatened 40 or 50 nations with armed aggression, ripped up international treaties and domestic regulations, granted corporations a licence to cook the planet, waged a global war against civil liberties and sought to bury that old-fashioned notion that the state should tax the rich and help the poor. The world would certainly be a safer and a better place without him.  As a result, a Guardian leader told us last week, these are ""exceptional circumstances Mr Kerry's flaws and limitations are evident; but they are put in the shade by the neo-conservative agenda and catastrophic war-making of Mr Bush"". In an open letter to Ralph Nader in January, the Nation magazine claimed: ""This is the wrong year for you to run: 2004 is not 2000. George W Bush has led us into an illegal pre-emptive war, and his defeat is critical.""  The problem with this argument is that both publications said the same thing about the 2000 elections. The Nation's columnist Eric Alterman blames Al Gore's defeat on Nader's ""megalomania"". Three days before the vote, the Guardian argued that ""... the marginalised Mr Nader cannot win ... Exciting [Al Gore] ain't. A visionary he is not. But he is the safe, wise choice.""  And similar warnings have been issued during almost every presidential election in modern times. Under the US   electoral system, which is constructed around patronage, corruption and fear of the media, there will always be exceptional circumstances, because it will always throw up dreadful candidates. Only when the Americans choose a man or woman who is prepared to turn the system upside down and reintroduce democracy to the greatest democracy on earth will these exceptional circumstances come to an end. In choosing the bad rather than the terrible in 2004, in other words, Americans will be voting for a similar choice in 2008. Whereupon they will again be told that they'd better vote for the bad, in case the terrible gets in.  Any president who seeks to change this system requires tremendous political courage. He needs to take on the corporations which have bought the elections, and challenge the newspapers and television stations which set the limits of political debate. Kerry, who demonstrated plenty of courage in Vietnam, has shown none whatsoever on the presidential stump. Last week, when the Republicans were questioning his commitment to defence, he announced that ""even knowing what we now know"" he would have voted to give President Bush the authority to attack Iraq.  Ten days ago his national security adviser James Rubin told the Washington Post that if Kerry was president he would ""in all probability"" have launched a military attack against Iraq by now.   Kerry's ability to raise almost as much money as the Republicans is seen as a triumph for American democracy; but his corporate backers are funding him not because they believe in democracy, but because they believe that he will do what they want. And they are unlikely to be wrong. When Kerry gets his orders, he reports for duty.  The idea that this frightened, flinching man would oversee the necessary democratic revolution is preposterous. He has made the system work for him by working for the system. He knows that as soon as he turns against it, it will destroy him. What else does he have to fall back on? Charisma? Popular enthusiasm? He's no Hugo Chvez. A vote for Kerry is not just a vote against George Bush. It is a vote for the survival of the system which made Bush happen.  I'm not an unhesitating fan of Ralph Nader's - I believe that some of his positions on trade, for example, are wrong - but no one could deny that he possesses courage. His decision to stand in November, when even his former supporters are telling him not to, is as brave as it is foolhardy. He has spent his working life fighting the corporations and being attacked in the media. This month he did something no other US politician has dared to do, and took on the Anti-Defamation League, the organisation which smears opponents of Israeli policy as anti-semites.  He won't be elected in November, of course, but that's not the point. The point is that if you want to change a system, you have to start now, rather than in some endlessly deferred future. And the better Nader does, the faster the campaign for change will grow.  The Nation claims that Nader would have ""a far more productive impact"" as ""a public citizen fighting for open debates and rallying voters to support progressive Democrats"". But what possible incentive would the Democrats have to listen to him? He has influence over these cowering creatures only while they are afraid that he might take their votes.  None of this is to suggest that there is no difference between Kerry and Bush. Where Bush is active, Kerry is passive. He wants to maintain massive levels of defence spending, but, despite his efforts to assure the media that he is as mad as Bush, he would probably be more reluctant to attack other nations. He wants to cut taxes, but he is less willing to wage war on health and education. He wants to hold down the price of oil, but doesn't want to help the corporations open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.  The question is whether this difference is sufficient to justify the abandonment of the only current electoral attempt to democratise the US political system. I don't believe it is. Progressives on both sides of the Atlantic are asking American voters to sacrifice liberty for security, and democracy for expediency. The voters should ignore them."
12,"If Bush wins,"" the US writer Barbara Probst Solomon claimed just before the election, ""fascism is possible in the United States."" Blind faith in a leader, she said, a conservative working class and the use of fear as a political weapon provide the necessary preconditions. She's wrong. So is Richard Sennett, who described Bush's security state as ""soft fascism"" in the Guardian last month. So is the endless traffic on the internet.  In The Anatomy of Fascism, Robert Paxton persuasively describes it as ""... a form of political behaviour marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity"". It is hard to read Republican politics in these terms. Fascism recruited the elite, but it did not come from the elite. It relied on hysterical popular excitement: something which no one could accuse George Bush of provoking.  But this is not to say that the Bush project is unprecedented. It is, in fact, a repetition of quite another ideology. If we don't understand it, we have no hope of confronting it.  Puritanism is perhaps the least understood of any political movement in European history. In popular mythology it is reduced to a joyless cult of self-denial, obsessed by stripping churches and banning entertainment: a perception which removes it as far as possible from the conspicuous consumption of Republican America. But Puritanism was the product of an economic transformation.  In England in the first half of the 17th century, the remnants of the feudal state performed a role analogous to that of social democracy in the second half of the 20th. It was run, of course, in the interests of the monarchy and clergy. But it also regulated the economic exploitation of the lower orders. As RH Tawney observed in Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (1926), Charles I sought to nationalise industries, control foreign exchange and prosecute lords who evicted peasants from the land, employers who refused to pay the full wage, and magistrates who failed to give relief to the poor.  But this model was no longer viable. Over the preceding 150 years, ""the rise of commercial companies, no longer local, but international"" led in Europe to ""a concentration of financial power on a scale unknown before"" and ""the subjection of the collegiate industrial organisation of the Middle Ages to a new money-power"". The economy was ""swept forward by an immense expansion of commerce and finance, rather than of industry"". The kings and princes of Europe had become ""puppets dancing on wires"" held by the financiers.  In England the dissolution of the monasteries had catalysed a massive seizure of wealth by a new commercial class. They began by grabbing (""enclosing"") the land and shaking out its inhabitants. This generated a mania for   land speculation, which in turn led to the creation of sophisticated financial markets, experimenting in futures, arbitrage and almost all the vices we now associate with the Age of Enron.  All this was furiously denounced by the early theologists of the English Reformation. The first Puritans preached that men should be charitable, encourage justice and punish exploitation. This character persisted through the 17th century among the settlers of New England. But in the old country it didn't stand a chance.  Puritanism was primarily the religion of the new commercial classes. It attracted traders, money lenders, bankers and industrialists. Calvin had given them what the old order could not: a theological justification of commerce. Capitalism, in his teachings, was not unchristian, but could be used for the glorification of God. From his doctrine of individual purification, the late Puritans forged a new theology.  At its heart was an ""idealisation of personal responsibility"" before God. This rapidly turned into ""a theory of individual rights"" in which ""the traditional scheme of Christian virtues was almost exactly reversed"". By the mid-17th century, most English Puritans saw in poverty ""not a misfortune to be pitied and relieved, but a moral failing to be condemned, and in riches, not an object of suspicion ... but the blessing which rewards the triumph of energy and will"".  This leap wasn't hard to make. If the Christian life, as idealised by both Calvin and Luther, was to concentrate on the direct contact of the individual soul with God, then society, of the kind perceived and protected by the medieval church, becomes redundant. ""Individualism in religion led ... to an individualist morality, and an individualist morality to a disparagement of the significance of the social fabric.""  To this the late Puritans added another concept. They conflated their religious calling with their commercial one. ""Next to the saving of his soul,"" the preacher Richard Steele wrote in 1684, the tradesman's ""care and business is to serve God in his calling, and to drive it as far as it will go."" Success in business became a sign of spiritual grace: providing proof to the entrepreneur, in Steele's words, that ""God has blessed his trade"". The next step follows automatically. The Puritan minister Joseph Lee anticipated Adam Smith's invisible hand by more than a century, when he claimed that ""the advancement of private persons will be the advantage of the public"". By private persons, of course, he meant the men of property, who were busily destroying the advancement of everyone else.  Tawney describes the Puritans as early converts to ""administrative nihilism"": the doctrine we now call the minimal state. ""Business affairs,"" they believed, ""should be left to be settled by business men, unhampered by the intrusions of   an antiquated morality."" They owed nothing to anyone. Indeed, they formulated a radical new theory of social obligation, which maintained that helping the poor created idleness and spiritual dissolution, divorcing them from God.  Of course, the Puritans differed from Bush's people in that they worshipped production but not consumption. But this is just a different symptom of the same disease. Tawney characterises the late Puritans as people who believed that ""the world exists not to be enjoyed, but to be conquered. Only its conqueror deserves the name of Christian.""  There were some, such as the Levellers and the Diggers, who remained true to the original spirit of the Reformation, but they were violently suppressed. The pursuit of adulterers and sodomites provided an ideal distraction for the increasingly impoverished lower classes.  Ronan Bennett's excellent new novel, Havoc in its Third Year, about a Puritan revolution in the 1630s, has the force of a parable. An obsession with terrorists (in this case Irish and Jesuit), homosexuality and sexual licence, the vicious chastisement of moral deviance, the disparagement of public support for the poor: swap the black suits for grey ones, and the characters could have walked out of Bush's America.  So why has this ideology resurfaced in 2004? Because it has to. The enrichment of the elite and impoverishment of the lower classes requires a justifying ideology if it is to be sustained. In the US this ideology has to be a religious one. Bush's government is forced back to the doctrines of Puritanism as an historical necessity. If we are to understand what it's up to, we must look not to the 1930s, but to the 1630s.   www.monbiot.com"
5,"Although everyone is lining up for or against a war on Iraq, few are asking what the war would be for. We know it would be against Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. But what will the Americans and their British sidekicks be fighting to replace the tyrant with? It's impossible to say with certainty, but most reports from Washington suggest that Bush wants another tyrant and Blair will concur. The alternative is the Iraqi National Congress, a loose and fractious coalition, but one which, for all its faults, is committed to democracy. The CIA and State Department hate it and the bad example a liberated Iraq would give to the repressed people of Saudi Arabia.  The hostility has relented a little - the State Department has agreed to meet the INC on 9 August. We'll have to see what happens, but Iraqi exiles believe the CIA has a list of 15 approved generals from which a new leader will be picked.  The prime candidate was General Nizar al-Khazraji, the army chief of staff when Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the highest-ranking military defector. He lives in exile in Copenhagen and had nothing to fear except Hussein's assassins until a Kurdish refugee saw him in the street.  In a scene straight out of Marathon Man, the refugee cried that this was the man who had levelled his village. The Danish Justice Ministry is now investigating charges that al-Khazraji was up to his neck in the 'Anfal' campaign of 1988 (named after the cheery chapter in the Koran on the spoils of war).  Uncounted numbers of Kurds were driven from their homes and tens of thousands died in prison camps. Al-Khazraji denies the charges, and many Kurdish leaders are working on the 'my enemy's enemy principle' and don't give a damn what he did.  If the US goes for a military hardman, it is likely to find a general against whom plausible allegations of war crimes can be made. The alternative is a democratic, federal Iraq, which gives rights to the Kurds and Shias currently suffering under the apartheid rule of the Sunni minority, and places the military under civilian control.  The INC says neither Downing Street nor the Foreign Office has raised a voice in support of its democratic dream. If anything, the Brits are more fanatical supporters of infinite injustice in the Gulf than the Yanks."
5,"Many parents wonder about the point of having children. They burn up your money, sleep and social life, and then blame you for all their problems. In politics, however, children are a source of perpetual joy. They must be seen and heard at every opportunity. In 1993, Michael Howard found that children were just what he needed to prevent the young Tony Blair outflanking the Tory government on the Right. The parents of children as young as 10 would be fined, and in extreme cases jailed, if their sprogs didn't comply with court orders, the tough Home Secretary announced. Alun Michael, Labour's Home Affairs spokesman, condemned Howard's plans as 'unworkable and pathetic'. But in the jailing of parents as in so much else New Labour proved it could be flexible. In the run-up to the 1997 election, Jack Straw promised that 'parental supervision orders' would be imposed on the parents of children who played truant. Failure to comply would lead to a spell in the slammer. Howard matched him word for word. Once in power, New Labour announced fines and possible prison sentences for parents in November 1997. It did so again in September 1999. And in March 2000. And in October 2000. And in this year's Queen's Speech. None of these schemes will ever amount to much because the courts have the sense to realise that jailing parents often means sending children into council care - which short of shooting the dears is about the worst thing you can do to them. But nothing stops this Government. Even though the Queen's Speech was scarcely a month old, Charles Clarke tried to divert attention from the Cherie affair last week by announcing - but, of course - the fining and jailing of parents. The media treated it as a serious and novel measure. What with one thing and another in the past fortnight, journalists have given the impression of being cynical brutes. In truth, we are drooling innocents with the memories of goldfish with learning difficulties."
5,"As the stock market crash makes comparisons with 1929 seem too plausible for comfort, the Government has acted decisively. It doesn't want to protect the owners of pensions and endowments, who have seen their savings slashed. Rather, it wants to shield the 'Big Four' accountancy conglomerates, which presided over the frauds and manias of the speculative bubble, from the consequences of their actions. A few weeks ago, Patricia Hewitt slipped out a remarkable parliamentary answer. The Government was considering sheltering auditors from being sued for negligence, she said. The details had yet to be sorted out, but a review of company law would limit auditors' liability.  Accountancy Age added that Hewitt had capitulated after a lobbying campaign by the Big Four - PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte &amp; Touche and Ernst &amp; Young - had 'won sympathy' in Whitehall. A cap of somewhere between £100 million and £200m on their liability was on the way.  It is perhaps worth pausing to consider how impervious the political class is to a world it no longer understands. Like all bubbles, the 'New Economy' dementia of the late 1990s was powered by the perverse belief that it was profitable to buy dotcom and telecom shares, even when you knew their long-term value was likely to be nothing. But, as the collapse of Enron and WorldCom showed, fraud played its part in whacking up the price of worthless companies.  Arthur Andersen was the auditor in both cases. By a weird coincidence, Hewitt was employed by Andersen before New Labour came to power. She won't be able to go back there when she's finally thrown out of politics - robbed American investors have sued Andersen out of existence.  However, she can still help the rest of the City. Even before she announced she would grant accountants privileges not available to other institutions, Hewitt had made it clear that she wouldn't tackle the brazen conflict of interest at the heart of auditing.  Because auditors can sell valuable ser vices to companies, including advice on how to dodge the taxes the rest of us must pay, they have a compelling incentive to keep senior managers sweet by failing to alert the public to crime in the boardroom.  Investigations into the corporations at the heart of the crash have shown that turning a blind eye to fraud wasn't a one-off offence committed by lightheaded auditors in the madness of the late 1990s: it was a systemic policy.  As early as 1987, dealers in Enron's New York office were betting on the future price of oil without protecting themselves with hedges in case their gambles backfired. They also set up shell corporations in Panama. These created phantom deals which impressed Wall Street and produced healthy earnings for Enron, on paper at any rate. Large bonuses flowed to the traders in recognition of their good work.  The managers in Houston didn't realise that the deals were phony, but did notice that company money was disappearing into the traders' pockets. Kenneth Lay, the Enron boss, refused to fire his thieving employees. 'I have decided not to terminate these people,' he said. 'I need their earnings.' The traders stayed on and committed Enron to supplying tens of millions of barrels of oil it didn't have. The company was stuck in an unsustainable position. If its rivals had found out, they could have wrecked Enron by forcing up prices.  With luck and phenomenal bluffing, the management escaped bankruptcy by a whisker, although it was compelled to make an $85m charge against earnings in 1987. Far from learning caution from the near-death experience, Lay learned that the paper profits which impressed shareholders and bankers could be inflated or, let's face it, invented. He avoided the unpleasantness calling in the police would have brought.  An Enron accountant who saw Lay stick by his crooked colleagues told Vanity Fair : 'It was obvious to us and to Arthur Andersen that [the traders] had opened fraudulent bank accounts, and we felt that they were going to con tinue to manipulate transactions.' Lay wasn't bothered. He was 'a guy who put earnings before scruples rather than reacting to the dishonesty right in front of him'.  One of the reasons why your investments keep going down is that auditors didn't nip fraud in the bud. If they had, the fees from other services, and the possibility of switching jobs and joining the firms they were meant to police, would have disappeared.  They don't need to worry about serving the public interest by doing their work honestly. Their sole fear is they may join Arthur Andersen in the corporate graveyard if investors sue them for gross negligence.  Hewitt is determined to save them from that terrible fate and, in doing so, is proving that New Labour is well to the Right of the Tories and the Bush administration.  You can't turn on the radio without hearing wails about the compensation culture. Lawyers shake billions out of the NHS each year and government departments are punished for insisting that civil servants should have the good manners to be tidily dressed when they meet the unemployed.  Hewitt won't limit their liability. The nearest she can come to a justification for giving benefit of clergy to the City is that there will be a cartel if another accounting giant is destroyed by its crimes. She ignores the fact that the Big Four already is a cartel.  A reputable system of financial management would require it to be broken up by ending the accounting conglomerates' conflict of interest. If auditors were banned from selling extras to managers, the firms would have to be split into separate auditing and financial services companies.  Rather than tackle a quasi-monopoly, Hewitt is strengthening it. In the United States, the regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission have already rejected attempts by British accountants to limit their liability for false statements. Investors who believed what the Big Four said were entitled to sue if the accounts turned out be fraudulent or misleading.  Even Bush's corporate-powered America has its limits, it seems. In Britain, there are none.  The accountancy cartel badgered Ministers for years to grant it the favour of capping its liabilities. Prem Sikka, professor of accountancy at Essex University, said it lobbied the Tories, but found that they were a tougher proposition than New Labour.  In 1996, the Law Commission said: 'We can find no principled arguments for a ""capping"" system... it cuts across a principle that a wrongdoer should compensate the plaintiff for loss.' So it does. And with so many people facing such large losses, you do have to wonder why the Government is desperate to protect the profession which helped get us into this mess in the first place.   <B>It is not only David Irving who denies the Holocaust</B>The ease with which 'a racist, a Holocaust denier and a falsifier of history' can prevent the public reading books which expose him as a racist, a Holocaust denier and a falsifier of history continues to be a wonder of the English libel law.  Last year, I reported on the strange career of Telling Lies About Hitler by Richard J. Evans. The professor of modern history at Cambridge University had produced an account of the libel action David Irving brought against Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt, the author of Denying the Holocaust. Irving's attempt to ban the book and win a fortune in damages was a crushing failure. Mr Justice Gray ruled that he was a racist, a Holocaust denier and so on.  The way appeared clear for readers to learn how fraudulent history prospered. Among the many lies Evans dissected was how Irving inflated the death toll from the RAF's bombing of Dresden tenfold 30 years ago. The fake figure is quoted to this day.  Four publishers promised to produce the detective story, but pulled out for fear that Irving would sue. Their terror was absurd. What little reputation Irving had before the trial was destroyed by the judgment. He can't sue because he has no reputation to lose.  The mere threat of a libel action was enough, however, to turn the fine liberals of literary London into censors. The story seemed to have a happy ending when Verso, a small Left-wing house agreed to release the book. Six thousand copies were sold, and you can still buy it in good book shops.  But not on amazon.co.uk. The online dealer boasts that it provides 1.5 million titles. Nazi works are among them. Yet Amazon has dropped Evans's attack on a man who fabricated in the Nazi interest.  As it stands, the law of libel allows booksellers to be sued, as well as publishers and authors. It's as if telephone companies could be taken to court for slanders that their phone lines carry.  Given this authoritarian provision, I would have a touch of sympathy for Amazon if it hadn't told Professor Evans's publishers that it put the protection of its shareholders' wallets before freedom of speech and freedom of publication."
5,"The scandal of the moment is that Sir Mark Thatcher was arrested in Cape Town and is helping police with their inquiries into allegations that he helped finance a plot to overthrow the dictator of a miserable West African state which has no obvious attractions to the sons of Tory leaders other than enormous oil reserves. Among the alleged co-conspirators are Simon Mann, a mercenary and an old boy of Eton, Sandhurst and the SAS; David Hart, another old Etonian and one of the most ruthless operators of the Thatcher years; and Ely Calil, a British-based Lebanese tycoon who makes his money from the West African oil trade.  As The Observer reported, Peter Mandelson, twice-sacked minister and EU commissioner, rented a flat from Calil. It was in Holland Park, a part of London so expensive I don't need to waste time describing where it is because you can never afford to live there.  Mandelson had been forced to move to Calil's apartment after the press revealed that he had used a private loan from a fellow minister, Geoffrey Robinson, to buy his previous home in Notting Hill, another part of London you may as well forget about. Mandelson and the Lebanese oil baron have a common friend in James Palumbo, the upper-class owner of the Ministry of Sound who made tens of millions by slumming it in the pop business.  While Mandelson was in Holland Park, he was forced to offer one of his many resignations after he was accused of lobbying on behalf of the billionaire Hinduja brothers, who were at the time up to their necks in the biggest arms scandal in the history of independent India.  No one suggests that Mandelson has anything to do with the alleged African conspiracy. What's telling is that he has been mixing with very rich men, be they the friends of the Thatcher family, sprigs of the Palumbo family or the brothers from the Hinduja family. These are odd circles to find a Labour minister in. Let me put it to Labour readers like this: if you were invited to these people's parties, would you want to go?  The scandal before the last scandal was the gossip about David Blunkett's love life. If he had behaved like a decent Labour politician and had an affair with the chairwoman of his constituency's Unison branch, it would have been a private matter. But after so many years of stealing Tory policies, New Labour has moved on to stealing Tory wives.  His liaison was with Kimberly Fortier, the American publisher of the right-wing  Spectator . Fortier set up home in Britain with her husband, the publisher of Vogue, in a £2 million town house in Mayfair, yet another of those central London districts you can't afford to think about. Blunkett had a romantic retreat on the Chatsworth estate of Deborah 'Debo' Mitford, the dowager Duchess of Devonshire, who, I should add in mitigation, was one of the few Mitford sisters who wasn't actually a Nazi.  Again there is a jolting sense of dislocation. Blunkett constantly plays the prolier-than-thou card against anyone who questions his attacks on civil liberties. His opponents are Hampstead bleeding-hearts, he bellows. Guardian -reading girls' blouses who don't know what hard men forged in the furnaces of Sheffield must do to clear the mean streets of crime.  But when his day's work is over, he dismisses bourgeois Hampstead as too common for his refined tastes and heads up-market to the aristocratic attractions of Mayfair and Chatsworth; to parties at the Spectator and dinners with Barbara Amiel. He shows no signs of worry that the company he keeps may mark him as a stonking humbug.  Before the last two scandals, there was the one about Tony Blair choosing to accept a free holiday from Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire who has bought the Italian media and politics as a job lot. Before that there were Lakshmi Mittal, Enron, Arthur Andersen, Ecclestone.  The common thread is money: old money, new money, funny money - and the peculiar individuals who get and spend it. You had better get used to seeing politicians partying with money in all its guises. Learning to love the rich may soon become the only way for politicians to survive.  Last week the Electoral Commission released its latest report on party political funding. Quite rightly there was a great deal of interest in the coincidence of Paul Drayson, a biotechnology entrepreneur, giving £500,000 to New Labour six weeks after New Labour made him a life peer.  But focusing on the details of one case misses the wider trend: British public life is increasingly dependent on the grace and favour of the super-rich. Such has been the accumulation of wealth at the top, the parties no longer have a financial need for mass memberships. Dr Peter Facey, director of the New Politics Network, a think-tank which monitors the cash flows, adds that for all the talk of the corporate takeover of government, they don't need corporations' money either. Donations from big business have, in fact, all but disappeared. The rich are now so rich they no longer have to go to the trouble of persuading directors and shareholders to authorise a payment from company funds when they can pay it from the petty cash.  In the last three months of 2003, for instance, Labour received £4.1 million. About £1.85m came from its traditional source, the trade unions, which can't donate without the approval of their members. The union contribution was matched by the personal presents of three men - Sir Christopher Ondaatje CBE, Lord Paul Hamlyn and William Haughey OBE - who gave £1.83m between them. Sir Christopher alone handed over £1m.  Donations of this size aren't always dubious. Try as the media might, we haven't been able to find anyone with a bad word to say about Ondaatje. He's just a rich man who thinks that Tony Blair is an excellent Prime Minister and wants to help him fight elections.  But you don't have to go back into the dealings around Ecclestone, Mittal and the rest to realise that the overall effect of the rise of the plutocracy is pernicious, even when it manifests itself in the amiable form of Ondaatje.  Last week's figures showed that the UK Independence Party received more money than the Liberal Democrats in the run-up to June's European elections.  Its good fortune wasn't the result of a surge in membership, but because a Yorkshire businessman, Paul Sykes, gave Ukip £715,000.  Suppose that as well as hating Europe, Sykes despised gays and loathed fox hunters. Would Ukip's leaders and members dare risk losing his money by drawing-up a manifesto which was for homosexual equality and for fox hunting? Maybe they would, but it isn't over-cynical to believe Sykes has bought himself a party which would never dare cross him.  It isn't just Ukip. Iain Duncan Smith's fate was sealed when Stuart Wheeler, the Conservative's biggest donor, said he wouldn't give a penny more to the party. When Duncan Smith was duly fired and Howard took over, the spread-betting tycoon opened his wallet and gave another £500,000. The Tories are no longer dependent on the support of business as a whole, but of one businessman, Wheeler, and a handful of like-minded tycoons.  Think of how many raffles and discos ordinary party members would have to organise to raise Wheeler's £500,000, Sykes' £715,000 or Ondaatje's £1m.  The result is a vicious circle. The big donors' big cheques go to the parties' headquarters in London. They strengthen the power of the centre, weaken local workers and fuel public suspicion of influence peddling. Party members sense their irrelevance. They drop out of politics and leave their parties more dependent on the big cheques from the big donors.  Next month the Electoral Commission will offer its proposals for reform. I hope they suggest cutting the cost of politics by banning billboard advertising and offering all kinds of incentives to politicians to seek small donations from ordinary citizens. I hope they're ruthlessly radical because at the moment we're looking at a future where public life will inevitably be run by an ever-shrinking coterie.  The Mandelsons and the Blunketts hang around the rich because they want to. Their successors may hang around the rich because they have to."
6,"There's strapping, bustling Jo Frost, sense and sensibility poured into a sensible suit. Dozy dads turned round in 30 minutes flat. Weepy mums dusted down or braced up. Appalling kids tamed on her ""naughty seat"". She is Supernanny incarnate (with male public school fantasies loosely attached). So why do I keep dreaming about the next TV series after Jo? Let's call it Supergranny, with Supernumerary Grandpa in tow. Supernan and Gramps have been auditioning for the job in Barcelona these past days, minding a three-child shop (six, four and two) while Mum and Dad were away on an Italian job for five nights. See Supernan getting six and four ready for school and a 40-minute commuting trail across town. Watch less-than-super Grumps deal somewhat irresolutely with two's breakfast.  I should, perhaps, explain at this stage that Beatrice is pretty memorable as tiny two-year-olds go. Is it her great, dark Spanish eyes? Is it her habit of suddenly saying surprising things? (""Look, Grandpa, the sun is going down over the hill and the shadows are growing longer."") But, for the moment, it's only 7.15am and the sun has barely crawled out of bed yet.  Six and four are eating their cereal peaceably in the living room, one eye on CBeebies, the other flitting occasionally floorwards as Supernanny puts their socks on. Beatrice, meanwhile, has clambered on to the kitchen sideboard and is ransacking cupboards.  ""Do you want Sugar Puffs or Coco Pops?"" I say. She wants the Puffs. Clear instruction. So I pour them out into a blue plastic bowl. No!!! Not the blue bowl. The yellow bowl? No!!! The red bowl. This red bowl? No, the other red bowl!! And do you want milk or tea? Tea. No, not in the yellow cup, the red one (which seems oddly orange-coloured, but maybe the racket is turning us both colour-blind).  Let's go and see CBeebies with Leo and Georgie, then. We troop next door - at which point it becomes clear that six and four are eating Coco Pops. The Sugar Puffs are duly renounced. It is Pops or nothing, or a bit more of a commotion. In the blue bowl or the red bowl? The reds are still on their winning streak. Supernumerary Gramps departs on the school trek with six and four. The bedraggled Pops float, uneaten, rejected with impunity, in a puddle of milk when I return an hour-and-a-half later.  Now there are several things to say at this point. One is that Beatrice, like her brother, sister and our other five grandchildren, is a pearl beyond price. Family politics. Another is that, as I scrabble in assorted cupboards for bowls and Pops and Puffs, obeying ever-changing demands with a vacuous grin, I feel oddly like Michael, Tony and Charlie back home. Red bowls, blue bowls, yellow bowls, krispies, krunchies, munchies? Yes ma'am, just put your cross on this scrap of paper here. Politics as usual.  But the one thing you can't do is call for sensible Jo, for this is an entirely different sort of show. Supernanny, of course, is formula TV down to the last kick and yowl. Scene one: desperate parents plead for a miracle. Scene two: Ms Frost whispers in their ear. Scene three: happiness is just a thing called Jo, jetting off to her new rescue act, leaving her trained agents of tranquillity behind.   What happens next? There's always a brief line filed ""a fortnight later"" which claims that the miracle yet endures. And four months later? We're never told.  But Supergranny and Gramps aren't in such wham-bang business. Their most precious gift is time. They want to come back again and again, so Jo is mostly total Frost. Are we in loco parents, required to do the full naughty-seat routine when Beatrice demands a large plate of prawns and noodles, sucks the prawns, ditches the spag and demands another ice cream?  No: we're not parents. The parents are away. We've nil reason (Supergranny wisely says) for majoring on their absence. Why go around stirring up misery? Our role is to hold the ring, to make sure everyone has the cheeriest days possible and not to let things go to hell on a handcart (or the scooter Beatrice likes to whiz along the corridor on, prompting voluble Catalan gloom from the lady in the flat below).  Is that an easy role? By no means. Skills learned across two decades of editing the Guardian don't wash with Beatrice when you have to explain that her sister has swigged the last Actimel. There's no one-hand or other-hand here, nor any firm prescription: only persuasion and distraction or humiliation.  Supergranny is a lifetime show, not 30 minutes of brusque denouement. Supergran is being in charge, but not in charge, of leading but following, of lips bitten without demur, of diplomacy and self-abnegation. No, Endemol, you could never sell it - except as a 24-hour rolling stint on E4.  Back home for Paxo and Howard and other delights, we have two more (nine and seven) of the eight stay overnight, watch TV from 7am as not-normally-allowed, eat pancakes and demand treacle sandwiches on the Jamie Oliver memorial beat. ""Not golden syrup?"" says their bristling Supermum. ""The sugar drives them wild."" No, it's black treacle ... you know, organic, healthy? Diplomacy cuts both ways.  Beatrice, as it happens, is three this very morning. Goodbye to the terrible twos. Happy birthday, love. Time and wisdom and beautiful eyes are on your side. And meanwhile, just over there in CBeebies' corner, the leader of the Conservative party, wriggling on a naughty sofa, is putting thousands of refugees in his blue bowl for another Frost - and pushing them out to sea. Somehow, looking after kids feels like a nobler job too."
6,"I broke the habit of half a lifetime last week and filled out a job application. To Mr Stephen Bampfylde of Saxton Bampfylde Hever plc ... ""Dear Sir, would you please put me on the application list to be the next parliamentary commissioner for standards?"" Dispatched with a first class stamp. I am not, of course, holding my breath. The next parliamentary commissioner ought to be the present parliamentary commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin. That may still happen - and if it shows any sign of so doing, my hat comes straight out of the ring. But does Ms Filkin accept Robin Cook's bland assurance that she has been ""neither sacked nor dismissed"" from the job she holds? Does her heart rise at the thought that an ""open and transparent system"" operated by an entirely opaque House of Commons commission will graciously put her on the shortlist if she fills out one of Saxton Bampfylde Hever's forms?   Especially when she sees that her successor is offered the ""possibility of (contract) extension by mutual agreement"" - which means that transparency ends once she packs her bags?  I haven't talked to Elizabeth Filkin - and have no idea what she intends to do. But who, wise in the ways of Westminster, would blame her if she decided to sit this humiliation out? After three years devoted toil - and too much whispered vilification - she may reasonably conclude that enough is enough, that playing more of the House's little games merely gives succour to her enemies.  Let's fervently hope it's not so. But what if it is? Then (which is the trouble with little games) we have a nasty hiatus. For who else with her reputation, pray, will volunteer to serve three years in the Commons salt mines in a role briskly downgraded between terms - a three-day week and a lower salary if Mr Bampfylde's small print speaks true? It isn't exactly a glowing prospectus.  There will, of course, be some applications. Unemployment is on the rise again. But the Filkin reputation will be desperately hard to replicate - and the damage that her ""non-dismissal"" has done is manifest. MPs may prefer not to realise it, but the fight against political sleaze and public cynicism which began seven years ago goes on unremittingly. Ask Keith Vaz (if you can find him these days).   Ask Geoffrey Robinson after his three weeks in the sin bin studying investment portfolios. These barricades need manning. And the men and women who man them need to be visible, not heads sunk below the parapet.  Here's why my application went in. I've ""operated at the most senior level within a complex institution"" (welcome to the Guardian maze). I've a ""reasonable understanding of the working of the House"" - for my sins. I've trooped through privileges committee hearings and inquiries by the commissioner, given evidence to Nolan and Neill and the over-arching committee for standards in public life. Appropriate ""personal standards of integrity and propriety""? This ""hound from hell"" could at least make the argument.  At least, if I'm known to be a contender, then you on the outside have something to measure the workings of the system and its final choice against. If you know what, in part, went in, then you can judge what came out. Three cheers for Elizabeth Filkin (or Martin Bell). No cheers for Sir Simeon Sludgeworthy.  The bitter reality, of course, is that nothing was supposed to happen this way. It wasn't what Lord Nolan prescribed in the wake of the Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith debacle. His committee for standards in public life, in its magisterial first report, wanted a parliamentary commissioner of ""independent standing"" who ""would have the same ability to make findings and conclusions public as is enjoyed by the comptroller and auditor-general...""  Linger over that. A person of independent standing, not the servant of a committee of politicians free to disregard or water down her conclusions - and to lever her out of her job in a couple of months. A direct comparison with the comptroller and   auditor-general: Sir John Bourn has held that job by Crown appointment since 1988. His independence is guaranteed by total security of tenure.  Lord Nolan didn't get his way. MPs closed clubby ranks and Sir Gordon Downey was cast as the port of first resort, receiving complaints against Hon Members, making an initial investigation (though without any investigators on his tiny staff) and passing them on to other Hon Members for action. The ""outside"" influence Nolan thought so crucial to public trust and proper accountability became a transit zone. The fig-leaf tendency glimpsed sunlit uplands just over the time horizon.  Not, perhaps, without a struggle. Elizabeth Filkin has struggled mightily. She has taken the rules her political employers gave her and applied them punctiliously. Her investigations of Mr Vaz and Mr Robinson are masterpieces of forensic energy and detail. She has done her duty.  With what reward? Murmured moans from the ex-great and good on the lecture circuit. Schoolboy antics of tit-for-tat complaining across the political divide. And, most depressing of the lot, orchestrated briefing against her from ""friends"" of threatened ministers.  Who will rid us of this troublesome commissioner? Enter Saxton Bampfylde Hever plc. Enter due process. In an ideal world, the PM would pause in his moral sermonisings to the world and say what, as an ordinary, honourable Joe, he thinks of Ms Filkin's predicament. In an ideal world, the new chairman of the standards and privileges committee, Sir George Young, would have joined hands with Peter Bottomley and spoken on her behalf. In an ideal world, Sir Nigel Wicks, successor to Nolan and Neill, would have broken cover already. His committee has two big things on the boil. One, a big research programme on public attitudes. The other, a giant stocktake of what's been delivered on those seven reports over seven toiling years. The Filkin fiasco sits balefully under both those headings.  It was Sir Nigel who said in his first press conference early this year that Ms Filkin should be given greater power ""to obtain information when investigating cases"", that she shouldn't have to battle so long through the forests of Vaz or John Reid obfuscation. For ""greater power"", it seems, read less power and no job. In an ideal world, he'd make that point openly. He can defend the way the Department of Transport handled Jo Moore in a letter to this paper. Gratefully received. But what about Elizabeth Filkin and the basic infrastructure of Commons regulation?  Well, we'll see. At least now you know that somebody's applied, and why. Because the commissioner is a bridge to you, not a stone wall at the end of a dark alley. Because you need to be involved and concerned. I promise - famous last words - to keep you informed."
6,"Politics is one thing (says a disarmingly frank senior Tory of recent acquaintance) and life is rather another. Life isn't 10-year plans or defining choices or big sackings. It is what happens next, the theatre of the unexpected. It is slopping coffee all over your road map. It is Alan Milburn Mark Two, not Mark One. My Tory - another one who doesn't want to be prime minister - could, indeed, have been talking about reshuffle time, the moment when human hopes and fears come brutally together. But in fact, predictably enough, he was on again about Europe and the euro - and hoping that Tony Blair wouldn't run his pending referendums together into some pseudo-apocalyptic vote on whether we want to be in or out. Give the great British people an allegedly stark choice between pottering on and dramatic change, and the faint hearts will have it every time.  But there isn't any real starkness here, he says. That's only the phoney edge of political rhetoric. Vote no and something - something we hadn't thought of, something the pundits of doom had discounted - will turn up. See? Life's a ramble, not a route march. Lie back and think of England on a sunny summer day.  Or rather, Ireland and Albania on two successive summer days. Go from one to the other, like me, and wash the scent of Blair right out of your hair.  Here we are in Dublin, roaming the narrow lanes at the back of Grafton Street. Cafe society, in the universal uniform of tank tops and tight jeans, is sitting out, chattering. The cash swilling over the counters, of course, is the euro. Are the Irish happy with that? They'd have been happier, perhaps, if Gordon O'Brown had gone a bit easier on his five pillars of wisdom - and happier, too, if the old leprechaun of inflation wasn't beginning to jig around again. But let's not pile on the gloom.  Growth is still strong by most reasonable standards. Not many blame the Central Bank. And Dublin itself, for the returning visitor, is a revelation. It used, long ago, to be Liverpool continued by other means: great buildings, narrow terraces, decay and decrepitude leavened with jokes and music. Now it is Europe. You sit with Finns and French and - inevitably - Americans. The girl behind the cash desk is English. Her manager is Chinese. Ireland used to be a place to get away from. Today it's a place where the world wants to call, a place to linger and maybe to live.  And that has very little to do with politicians, some of them notably duff and tainted, almost all of them voted out of office after a single term. They're no better than they ought to be. The change, with its lightness of spirit, is in the people. They have seen an opportunity - the opportunity of a political space - and filled it with buzz and bustle. They've transformed their physical existence. They've put the quality into their own lives. The latte touch.  And so to Tirana, which used to be Europe's answer to Pyongyang, the capital of a bizarre communist midget state drifting in poverty-stricken isolation between Moscow and Beijing. Only two years ago, it was grey and grim, rotting rubbish piled high in the streets, the fetid stench of abject poverty. No wonder that Albanians - like the Irish of old - took to boats and the backs of lorries and tried to escape.  But now it, too, is suddenly part of Europe. Heatwave evening and all Tirana - seemingly all its 750,000 citizens - has taken to the streets. The young, in their kit, sit at the cafes and restaurants which line the streets. Kids run in the parks. Mum and dad do their stately promenade. This is the Mediterranean, part Greece, part Italy, wholly surrendering to the night.  Who do we thank? A sort-of politician can take a bow. Edi Rama is a 38-year-old art professor who came home to help when the Hoxha regime crumbled, and ran for mayor. He did the simple things. He filled some holes in some roads. He got the refuse collectors off their butts. He built a new cinema and cleaned up the parks. And - because of the art - he had Tirana painted. The greys have gone. The streets are a chaotic blaze of ochre and azure and crimson and brown. There are trees along the pavements. There is a stage on which people can perform.  Those people, again. They've been given the opportunity - and borders open, at last, for business - and they've taken it. Tirana, after decades of oblivion, is another happening place. Six months ago - only six months ago - the currency of local choice was the dollar. Forget that. Now, a spasm of fashion, every taxi driver and every cafe wants euros. I spent the last of my Irish stock in Albania.  Too euphoric by half? Of course. Progress is more than a coat of paint and a capuccino. The problems -   corruption, crime, sickness, education - are as frightening as any in the continent we share. But there is something precious here, and something which links umbilically with the Dublin experience. A feeling of hope and movement. A surge of energy. A belief that we - we, the people - can transform our own lives.  So my Tory who started the week was more right than he knew. Politics isn't life. The cabinet pack that Blair shuffled is next week's cold potatoes. No referendum is ever final. Dr John Reid might as well go to Wimbledon. And the euro, with Gordon doing his brooding bit? All Ireland is becoming a euro zone as it flows unstoppably back and forth across that porous frontier. Not a matter of what ministers ordain, just what ordinary people do. Meanwhile, in Albania, they've done it already, done what comes naturally."
6,"So to the last of the winter sales. What am I bid for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted? More or less than the &pound;17.7bn that went on O2, not to mention the &pound;9.5bn that sealed the Abbey National deal? We can throw in Luton, Cardiff and Belfast airports if you like. Or, since this isn't an exclusively British affair, the cash to help France's Le Monde stay afloat. Anything to keep shareholders smiling - as the Spanish keep coming.No mistake: there is a pattern here. Grupo Ferrovial isn't stalking the British Airports Authority on a whim. Banco Santander has got the Abbey habit fast and pretty efficiently. Abertis knows how to run most of our middle-range airports already. Telefonica may or may not have splurged too far amid the mobile mayhem, but it's in good company.Spain isn't a peripheral player any longer. Europe's fifth-largest economy has enjoyed a decade of consistent growth, and that progress - at roughly double Britain's current rate - continues. It has absolutely no need of lectures from Gordon Brown. It has started to strut a little across the world stage, to flaunt a success built of concrete, imagination and vaulting ambition.Here come Norman Foster, Frank Gehry, Richard Rogers, Arata Isozaki and the rest, true architects of globalisation. Where do they strut their stuff most enthusiastically? Put Bilbao's metro system in the Foster column, give Gehry the Guggenheim and Isozaki La Coruna's museum. Remember that Rogers' new airport for Madrid is the greatest infrastructure project in Europe - three times the size of Heathrow's terminal five.The point is utterly simple. From Barcelona's 1992 Olympics on, Spain has found a style and elan that set it apart. Only 30 years after Franco's death, it has become a different country. Many of those differences are charted with shrewd perception in Ghosts of Spain by the Guardian's fine Madrid correspondent, Giles Tremlett (out next month). He has watched Spain close up for 20 years. He has seen a zest for consensus - and impatience for action - sweep away the bureaucratic decay of fascism. He can sense the immensity and complexity of the change, so much hidden potential suddenly tapped.Will it last? Anyone who prophesies too blithely obviously risks rude awakening. Of course there are problems: inflation edging up, property prices teetering, a vulnerability over energy supplies, a whole portfolio of nationalist and regional problems. Doom pending? Stocks of that never run out whenever two economists drink coffee together. But that doesn't mean you can't count the triumphs, either.By chance last week I went straight from Dublin to Barcelona, a single flight and in many ways a single story: both economies pounding away, both cities transformed. Surely that shouldn't be happening, though? This is the eurozone, barren ground where the dead hand of the central bankers rules. This is everything we've been so supposedly wise to avoid - so wise, indeed, that it's not even a matter for polite conversation when joint prime ministers meet.Except, of course, that the euro has no more sunk Spain than it has sent Dublin to the bottom of the Irish Sea. It's convenient, in British terms, to look at what's not worked rather than what has. Thus Germany may be loftily lectured and France sniggered over. But European union, with a single currency with interest rates set at a level that encourages growth, has performed wonders just a step aside from this central stage.Go back to the last rites over Franco. What helped Spain come together in his perilous aftermath? The prospect of joining Europe. What has held it together and fuelled its progress ever since? The reality of belonging to Europe. When he looked around coming challenges for Guardian readers a few months ago, Spain's prime minister showed simple faith. ""Europe,"" Jos&eacute; Luis Rodr&iacute;guez Zapatero wrote, ""is the answer, the realistic answer of those who refuse to give in to pessimism or fear, and who redouble their efforts in times of difficulty.""No true Brit puffed with political ambition would dare make a claim in such terms. David Cameron has lost the hymn sheet. Brown prefers his summers in Cape Cod. Yet maybe it is time to wake up. What can Telefonica do with O2 that BT didn't dare? Why is Zara the queen of high streets around the world? How will Ferrovial - building motorways from Canada to Chile - cope with Heathrow?As you land on the plane from Cork or C&oacute;rdoba, perhaps, there'll be a bump on the runway every time. Bump to wake up. Bump to remember that Europe lives vibrantly beyond the Bay of Biscay."
9,"Dr Taylor will see you very soon, and you can have an hour with him,"" I was told. You don't hear that in the NHS very often, but then very few doctors are standing for parliament. Compared to a busy consultant, candidates have time on their hands.  Dr Richard Taylor is standing for the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern party. Astonishingly, he might win, defeating David Lock, a government minister. Martin Bell thinks he will win, and is coming to speak for him. Whatever happens, Dr Taylor will hugely influence the result, and thus scare all the mainstream parties. If an independent can scoop up buckets of votes over a hospital, what next? Schools, incinerators, the Stop People Parking In Our Street After Six O'clock party?   There's something engagingly amateurish about the enterprise. That clunky party name for one thing. Any half decent spin doctor would have called it Kidderminster Independent Candidates Killing A State Shutdown, providing a nifty acronym. Then there's the battle bus, which turns out to be a flat bed truck, draped with a few posters and pulled by a tractor, though that is to be replaced by a Land Rover.   Dr Taylor is a mild, thoughtful man, though moved to something near fury by the reduction of his beloved hospital to a shell operation. Patients suffering   anything serious have to go to Worcester, which for some is more than 30 miles away. Every politician has an oratorical style, which in his case I'd call ""bedside manner"", though when he gets really angry it's closer to a ringside manner.   Dr Taylor, a Labour voter four years ago, decided to go political in April 1999 and after two elections, the party is by far the largest single group on the local council.   I suspect Mr Lock may have slightly underestimated his opponent. Like many older doctors, Richard Taylor loves the health service. ""In its hey day, the NHS was magnificent. Then we had the chance of making it so good that private practice would have become a complete irrelevance.""   That kind of talk has got him labelled a ""medical dinosaur"", a ""militant"" and a ""meddling amateur"", though in my experience such abuse makes meddling amateurs even keener to keep on meddling.   I went to see Mr Lock, a man who has the burden of being Lord Irvine's representative on earth, or at least in the Commons. He was excited. ""Dr Taylor admitted at a public meeting last night   that it would be dangerous to bring A&amp;E back to Kidderminster. He's led everyone up the garden path. There is no longer any point in his campaign.""   I phoned Dr Taylor. ""The spin doctors are turning nasty,"" he said. ""I merely pointed out that it would be difficult to bring it back. That's not the same thing."" He is learning the first rule of politics: what you say doesn't matter; it's what your opponents can claim you say which counts.   Mr Lock assured me that the hospital was raised by only one voter in 10. But when he knocked on the door of someone labelled ""firm Labour"" on his canvassing sheet, the man said, ""I've been Labour thick and thin, right and wrong, all my life. But this hospital thing, it's a very sore point round here...""   When Dr Taylor went to a school to talk to parents, one woman told how her little boy had had a burst appendix, and she'd had to go to Worcester with him, and couldn't get home at all, so her husband had to leave work and look after the other three... Luck counts for a lot in elections, and yesterday at least, Dr Taylor had it in spades."
9,"The Chilcott inquiry heard from Sir John Scarlett yesterday, a spook as different from the spooks of popular fiction as you might meet beside a hollow tree in St James's Park. Present him with a dry martini and an evil billionaire who wants to take over the world, and I suspect he would be dashing off home to spread more John Innes on his roses. What he does have is a remarkable grasp of modern-day management-speak. Clearly this is far more important now than skills at codebreaking and driving fast cars. Before we were two minutes into his evidence, we were talking about ""structure, output and tasking."" ""Bond, I want you to make sure you stay within structure and output guidelines. And no more tasking gorgeous women."" The room where the inquiry is taking place is small and stuffy, with pipes running across the ceiling, so it resembles an interrogation chamber in some anonymous military building. As so often, my mind drifted  in this case to Berlin during the 1950s. George Smiley, played by Sir Alec Guinness, is being briefed by John Scarlett, an up-and-coming operative. All jargon comes from yesterday's session. Smiley gazed at the lights reflected in the Spree. Berlin was bitterly cold at that time in winter, but it was not just the chill that made him shiver under his greatcoat. A slender figure slid beside him. It was young Scarlett. ""I hear that Kalashnikov was a disappointment."" ""Oh, I don't know, sir. The interrogation was never formulaic, always substantial and often robust."" ""Did you get anything worthwhile?"" ""Well, sir, obviously we had to pay close attention to the requirements and priorities round, and bear in mind the formulation of the medium-term work programme, coupled with other short-term priorities."" Smiley grunted. A young couple, screeching with merriment, went past on their way to a bar or nightclub. The girl was clearly drunk and her boyfriend seemed to be almost dragging her along. Not for the first time, Smiley wondered about the coming generation. ""Did you see the minister?"" ""See the minister, sir? Sorry, I don't know what you mean."" Smiley sighed. Sometimes it was like dealing with people for whom English was a second, even a third language. ""I mean, did you brief the minister of defence about what Kalashnikov told us?"" ""Oh, gosh, I see, sir! You mean did I interface the customer?"" ""Yes,"" said Smiley with infinite weariness. ""I suppose that's what I mean..."" They actually talk about ministers, army chiefs, etc as ""customers"". And they don't meet them but ""interface"" them. Sir John Scarlett is older now, and has learned the techniques of the civil service. For example, he let Tony Blair off the hook when he said there had been no pressure to ""firm up"" the dossier on Iraq's weaponry. But, he was asked, his dossier was an assessment of the WMD campaign, not a threat assessment. That was all implied in the alarming foreword, written by Tony Blair. ""The foreword was overtly a political statement signed by the prime minister, so it was his wording and his comments. I didn't see it as something I could change."" The stiletto sinks in before the victim has even spotted it."
9,"They say that if you get trapped in quicksand you should not struggle. You must remain very still and wait for help.  Nobody has told Stephen Byers. The wretched transport minister has been flailing around for weeks now. It's a horrible sight. Every wave of the arms takes him an inch further down into the inky morass.    And nobody has thrown him a rope. The onlookers are all on firm, safe ground, gazing at the dreadful spectacle.   Take Harry Cohen, the MP for Leyton. He was one of the many Labour MPs who were in the chamber for transport questions, no doubt to give Mr Byers the support he so badly needs.   There was no sign of his celebrated press secretary, Jo Moore. Possibly she had decided that this would prove to be a good day to bury a bad minister.   Mr Cohen was in no mood to offer any support at all. He was furious about the public-private partnership for the London Underground. No wonder. He is a London MP. It's his constituents who will   suffer. The scheme was, he said, ""shaping up to be a disaster"". The deals were so appalling that contractors could underperform for years and still get big bonuses.   Then after seven years of incompetence, they could re-negotiate their contracts from a monopoly position. What's more they would stick to their own priorities, which had nothing to do with the priorities of passengers.   Mr Byers must have felt like a man in a mire who expected planking to be laid out for his escape, but instead felt the tentacle of an octopus wrap around his leg.   He blathered about £15bn investment in 13 years, but didn't answer Mr Cohen's charges.    Next it was the Tories' turn to make him squirm some more. Sir Sidney Chapman made the point that investment in the tube had been far less since 1997 than it had been in the equivalent period before 1997. Would Mr Byers confirm that?   Did he confirm it? Oh, grow up. He renewed his struggles. ""I think the issue is ..."" he began to Tory jeers and Labour silence. ""I will answer that question on my own terms!"" he said, to louder Tory jeers, and, in its own way, even louder Labour silence.   But he had not finished waving his limbs at us. Thrash, bang, wallop, arghhhh! ""We don't want a future of all our yesterdays, in which people blame each   other! It is not a time to re-write history, but to look forward and deliver the investment Londoners so badly need!""   A time to look forward? Not a time to dwell on all our yesterdays and blame the Tories for everything? What is the party for if it isn't about re-writing history? As Paul Flynn MP once wrote: ""In New Labour it is only the future that is certain. The past is continually changing."" Mr Byers would really love to blame the inactivity of John Prescott for all his travails, but that's not allowed.   The hubbub grew. Vincent Cable, a Lib Dem, asked if it was true that government money for public transport would in future be tied to   binding arbitration to stop strikes.   Mr Byers gathered about himself what dignity a drowning man can manage, and announced: ""The prime minister's official spokesman, and the prime minister himself, which is probably more important ...""   The rest of his reply was drowned in mocking cries of ""No, he isn't"", ""don't be silly"" and so on.   At this point I looked up at the civil servants who have the unhappy task of staffing the press office for Mr Byers. Of the four of them, three were laughing. You know that when the civil service joins in the general delight, the sand is about to close over your head."
9,"The House of Lords used to be the politest place in the land. Nobody ever shouted, like David Cameron, ""you're useless!"" No one yelled ""wrong, wrong, wrong!"" You would be as likely to see a food fight in the Athenaeum. There were ways of disagreeing. For example, if someone suggested the return of child chimney sweeps: ""The noble lord makes an intriguing point and one which your lordships may wish to ponder. However, Her Majesty's government feels unable, at this particular time, to make the commitment he requests."" All is changed, changed utterly. It's almost as nasty as the Commons now. Take the question about the ratification of the Lisbon treaty yesterday. It was answered by Lord Brett, of whom I have never heard, but who appears to be a minister in the Foreign Office. He took the opportunity to gloat about the Tories' problems on this issue. I might have paid more attention to what he said if he had not appeared to be channelling the late Les Dawson, whom he resembles both in voice and appearance. ""My old mum used to say: 'Never intrude into private grief,"" he said. There would be plenty of public grief if the Tories got their way. Lord Howell, the Tory spokesman, said: ""I knew we wouldn't get far without this kind of vacuous exchange."" Lord Brett: ""I noted the comments about the vacuous comments, and I appreciate the vacuous comments he added. Ooh, missus!"" (He didn't actually use the last two words, but some of the peers did go ""Whooo!"") Here's a pub quiz question. ""What is 10 in London and 1 in Warsaw?"" The answer is the letter Z in Scrabble. Lord Dykes said that the Polish papers were much better than our own, lacking the anti-European hysteria shown by quite a few members of the Conservative party. Whooo! Lord Brett claimed to be concerned about the Tories' strange allies in Europe. ""Another maxim of my old mum was: 'By their friends they shall be known.'"" We are being governed by the spirit of Lord Brett's mother. But everyone got off lightly compared with poor Lord Young of Norwood Green, who answered a question about grants for disabled students. Apparently these are in a terrible mess. It's the usual combination of arrogance, privatisation and computer cock-ups. Being New Labour, Lord Young called the situation ""a success story"". Lord Hunt, for the Tories, asked what, in that case, he would call a failure. ""The higher education policies of the last [Tory] government"" he replied. ""That would be my description of a failure."" The Tories jeered at the wretched response. Lord Young was, I fear, humiliated by everyone. Peers from all sides circled him like hyenas spotting a wildebeest with a limp. We only returned to normality with Lord West of Spithead, who contrived to work in praise for our heroic Royal Navy into an answer about cannabis use. I thought he might take the salute, or at least splice the mainbrace, whatever that means."
