1,"The politics of law and order are entirely about spin. Not just partly. Entirely. There is no field of political conflict where impression more fully eclipses reality. The two may not always be at odds. Some impressions are correct. Crime has doubled over the last 20 years, for example. That is a fact. Politicians' belief that the public wants only heavier sentencing is another truth that's not entirely fanciful. But the raw material Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe are handling when they promote this as an election issue is not fact but propaganda, otherwise known as spin. Consider the opening bids made yesterday. Mr Straw, introducing Labour's 10-year plan, said that his record on crime was ""the best of any incoming government for 50 years"". Sounds impressive. Ms Widdecombe countered that the Tory record from 1993-97 was the best four-year performance any outgoing government could show. Also, relatively, true. But what voter can begin to absorb, let alone believe, either statement, when every party is busy culling statistics to show that things have never been better, or, alternatively, worse in an area of policy where, depending when you start and what you cover and how you exclude and where you shade the figures, both claims are defensible?  Is crime going up? It depends what you're talking about. My colleagues Polly Toynbee and David Walker, in their valuable audit of the government, Did Things Get Better? (Penguin £6.99) take a   shot at it. Burglary? Down 21% in 2000. Car thefts? Down 15%, along with a 16% fall in thefts from cars. Crimes of violence fell by 4%. But street robbery? Up 14%. Clear-up rates? ""Haven't improved since 1997"", according to a worried memo from Straw's political adviser leaked this weekend. Ah, but what about convictions? ""Up by 13%,"" according to Straw on the Today programme yesterday.  Such statistics will fly about in the coming weeks. For the Tories are determined to make crime one of the biggest issues. It's one of the few they've got, perhaps the only one where the glass of governance will always reliably be seen as half empty not half full. For every stat, there may be an explanation that qualifies its meaning, as the Home Office's own research department often shows. What, why, when, where, how? You could write a book on each question applied to every crime, and people do. But in the politics of law and order, sophistication, however true, will always be outgunned by simplicity, however false.  This is made easier by public ignorance. In 1998 the British Crime Survey reported that the public thought judges' sentencing was too lenient. Four out of five people believed they were out of touch with what ""ordinary people think"". Questioned further, these ordinary people proved startlingly uninformed. Over half underestimated by at least 30% the sentences that were actually handed out. They believed half of male rapists were sent to prison, whereas the actual figure was 97%. House burglars and muggers   were similarly thought to be let off, when well over half in each category went to jail. Such are the sometimes grotesque misperceptions on which the reputation of the judiciary as a soft touch is based. Yet that's the image brainlessly cultivated by the tabloid press, which then finds its inescapable way into the critique and policies of ministers.  These policies are not always foolish. Serious experts are always trying to get to grips with the aberrations of social and human behaviour. The Thatcher-Major government passed a criminal justice act every year for so long that the later statutes began to undo what the earlier ones had done. The Blair government has a mixed record with its own creative initiatives. Both curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders, much brooded on and ostensibly reasonable, have failed to convince the people in the courts and on the ground, and have come to almost nothing. The latest proposed reforms also have something to be said for them. Explicitly permitting judges to take account of previous convictions when settling a sentence is a rational idea. It addresses the prime problem thrown up by the latest fashionable analysis, the familiar theme that much   crime is committed by no more than 100,000 people. The package looks like serious action. It's intended to be so. It should spin well, though the Tories will, as easily and bewilderingly, spin against it.  But through the murk and counter-murk three conclusions stare out, which confront ministers and their opponents with challenges that spinning doesn't adequately address. First, the best things the government wants to try will cost money. Yesterday's package is priced at £700m. Can this be enough to create the new custodial and semi-custodial regimes ministers talk of, pay courts to work twice as hard to accelerate hearings, and seriously increase police manpower all over the country? Of all remedies for deterrence and detection, common across all these confusing stats and counter-stats, a bigger police force is by far the most persuasive. Quite why Straw has so conspicuously failed to keep promises about police recruitment is a complicated mystery. It may not be entirely about money. But money will help. Is the Treasury committed to providing it for this vastly ambitious programme? Or are we watching mere propaganda sufficient unto May 3?  Second, though Straw, to show his all-round vision, stressed the causes of crime as much as crime itself, and commended the government's education and employment programmes, there's a hole at the heart of the picture. While offering drugs as an explanation for such crime problems   as he will admit to, he won't address the drug laws as a focus for reform, despite pressure and expert argument from those who are just as concerned and responsible as politicians. Decriminalising cannabis would wipe out a certain amount of crime at a stroke, freeing up police and courts for other priorities. The spinners dare not look at it.  Third, they dictate that prisons must go on blithely multiplying. Two of the less disputable current statistics are a) that Britain has the highest proportion of its population in prison of any country in Europe, and b) that, in a league table of crime as experienced by victims, England and Wales, with 58 crimes per 100 inhabitants, came out joint first in the industrialised world. No accountable politician is willing to make a connection between these profoundly interesting trends. The lord chief justice, the inspector of prisons, and the director of the prison service have all recently delivered clinical and passionate critiques of prison. The electoral auctioneers dare not change the terms of the debate.  One reason for this is that spinners can only deal with the lowest denominator of opinion, however ignorant. But the spinner always, more or less, lies. A more fruitful approach is available. The beginning of wisdom in the politics of law and order would be to understand that, since nobody can sort out one spinner from another, someone might start the arduous business of addressing the truth.","The Millennium Dome is out of sight. Down there in Greenwich, it's a long way from being in your face, even for most Londoners. For the nation, on whose children the prime minister once said the dome should confer ""memories so strong that it gives them that abiding sense of purpose and unity that stays with them through the rest of their lives"", it could be on another planet. But let memory speak, before the monster goes. It has been the most particular and incontestable folly of our time. The physical distance assists the political amnesia. It's hard to find any politician who will talk about the dome now. Lord Falconer shuffles forward to mutter about an exit strategy, while Chris Smith is compelled, as a coda to the disaster the government set in train, to pour another £29m of lottery money down the Greenwich drain, the better to ensure that this exit, selling off the asset for a fraction of what was put into it, can duly happen. The announcement is as blithe as it is insulting. Otherwise, what's past is past, we're told. Time to move on. Time to talk about Tate Modern, an altogether superior monument built from the pockets of the poor who finance the lottery. The dome? Forget it.  This request I cannot meet. Somehow boredom wouldn't measure up. There was such grandeur here that slinking silently away would do an injustice to history. And history was the frame. Greenwich is the home of time, the government said. This was why   Britain had a special duty to put on a millennial event that would lead the world and startle all who came from the ends of the earth to see it. The dome would ""make a statement for the whole nation,"" said Mr Blair. It was the way for us ""to take stock of ourselves"". How, by that test, do we look?  The amount of lottery money consumed on the dome is closing in on £550m. Only half the expected audience have so far been willing to pay out of their own pockets for the experience. For this financial failure, they themselves, the British and global public, are to blame. Damn the punters, they inexplicably found better things to do. So the first thing we look, as a nation, is culpable. We let our prophets down. We didn't do what we were told.  But this was because we were not properly informed. The public is one scapegoat, the media are another. Asked a few awkward questions, Michael Heseltine, who can be called the dome's first begetter, was anticipating this before the money had been spent. ""It's virtually impossible,"" he said, ""to do anything in this country of any imagination without the media trying to vilify and ruin it."" He was highlighting another national defect. We are apparently credulous in overlooking a brilliant creation just because a bunch of malign journalists tell us to. Or so the minister said.  
These are insignificant alibis for the truth. They spread the blame for the humiliating embarrassment the dome has become, so that we are all somehow guilty. Yet there has never been a project that grew so particularly and exclusively out of the preoccupations of the political class, irrespective of party, and the self-glorifying inanity in which its leaders are capable of collaborating as long as someone else pays.  The dome began as a Tory project, the last resounding belch of a dying regime. Promoted by the grandiloquent Heseltine and seized on by the cringing Mr Major, father of the lottery, it was supervised in the early stages by Virginia Bottomley and cheer-led by a variety of architects and propagandists with their own half-baked ideological, not to mention commercial, agenda for this way of proclaiming national greatness past and future - an assertion no other nation in the world felt that 2000 AD required it to make.  An additional rationale was proposed, concerning the renewal of poisoned land on the Greenwich peninsular. But it was never explained why this could be achieved only by the erection of a white elephant consuming, in all, £800m. History, and politics, were at the heart of it. Tories, when drawn into a discussion of their part, still contend that if a thousand years of history   had remained the millennial motif, a triumph was guaranteed. It was New Labour's obsession with modernity, they say, that confused an otherwise flawless project.  But New Labour was on board before the Tories' fall. The consensus was all but sealed. Given the chance in May 1997 to act like a new regime, unneedful of hyperbole, Mr Blair decided he couldn't let the old, dead, corrupted one outflank him in nationalistic display, however pointless. Nobody ever answered the question about what the dome was for, except for that. Miles of verbiage and armies of consultants, up to the very millennial moment, addressed the question of content and purpose, but none was able to improve on Heseltine's best shot: ""It's going to be quite wonderful but don't ask me how"". They still can't. Made manifest before our eyes, the dome declared its irretrievable emptiness.  Many political projects turn out to be less than perfect. Most, indeed, can never hope to succeed in anything but a contingent and partial way. There are always more schools to build and patients to cure. For that reason the political rhetoric attaching to them is almost meant to be taken with a shovelful of salt. The level of pretension is understood to be an aspiration, the money available for its fulfilment is always inadequate. Blaming politicians for their failure is often a ritual that they can deflect with earnest remarks about the sincerity of their efforts. And besides, there's always another party, putting them to the question.  The dome is a different case. Normal lines of responsibility do not exist. It was built with funny money, for which nobody is accountable. The Treasury would never have countenanced tax money being used. No business could have defended such folly to its shareholders. Lottery money, falling outside either discipline, was made available as a plaything for egotistical wasters who invented a national purpose that did not exist. Not a little matter of a few million, either, but a donation of colossal magnitude, deployed by the same people who decided it should be handed out: people of all parties with their fingers in the trough of self-indulgence, leaving none with hands clean enough to do the ensuing scandal justice.  What one misses here is the faintest semblance of regret. No whisper have I heard, from the principals or their auxiliaries, that they may have been responsible for a mistake. Apology seems out of the question. When not whimpering a few resentful words that miss the point, they are silent. They're moving on. The dome was yesterday. Just another well-meaning blip in the awkward lives of politicians committed to national renewal. But it wasn't. It was an avoidable idiocy, which leaves Britain looking like a nation led astray by profligate, self- regarding philistines."

The beginning of wisdom in the politics of law and order would be to understand that, since nobody can sort out one spinner from another, someone might start the arduous business of addressing the truth.","Prince Philip has done something unprecedented. He has denied, in the strongest possible terms, that he ever called Princess Di a trollop or a harlot in any of his letters to her. This is not very regal behaviour, entering into a media mudfight, but apparently his hands were tied - Prince William had given him an ultimatum, and we can all imagine how shattering that was (""Deny these words, or I'll never look at you shyly from beneath my bambi hair ever again!"" he probably said). Clearly, this kind of nonsense shouldn't detain us for a second, whether true or not. The facts of the matter are in no doubt - the people's princess was doing the nasty with someone other than her husband for some time before their separation. Therefore, to anyone capable of using words like ""trollop"" and ""harlot"" without laughing, that makes her a trollop. It may never be known whether Prince Philip said as much to her face, but since he gets such timeless joy from saying things like ""Gosh, you're very black, aren't you? How hilarious!"" to the faces of black people, it seems unlikely that he curbed himself in the face of the harlot. Anyway, in a case where one person's dead and the other one's cuckoo, it doesn't matter terribly who said what; it only matters that the extant one is behaving rather unusually.  Devout royal watchers will have noticed that Philip made the news twice at the weekend - the other time, it was a brief mention of the fact that he was spotted ostentatiously leashing his Labrador while out walking, in tacit reference to Princess Anne's recent fine under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Obviously, he was making some kind of humorous statement, here: Labradors are charmless hulks of goodwill, they'd never maul anyone.  Perhaps he was saying, ""You crazy members of the public, I suppose you'll want me to leash my Labrador next!"", or perhaps he was saying something else altogether. But the juxtaposition of the two stories does remind us that Princess Anne's case was also unprecedented.  She isn't the first royal to own a dangerous dog, and she isn't the first to cause needless harm to her subjects by failing to do something that anyone with half a brain would have done, but she's certainly the first to be successfully prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act. The Queen, normally a stickler for boring old precedent, also behaved somewhat innovatively during the trial of Paul Burrell. There's certainly no precedent in living memory for a queen to give evidence against herself in a case she really needn't have brought to court, if she'd known she was going to do that (I wonder if she can now prosecute herself for wasting her own time).  All families have to break with tradition at some point, but there is a problem when the royals do it. Not because we set higher standards for them than we do for each other, since we're all perfectly aware how only-human they are. No, it's because precedent is all they've got. Precedent is all that's standing between them and the rest of busted-flush aristocracy; more importantly, from their point of view, it's all that's standing between them and proper income tax.  It is an undisputed fact that nobody accords the royals any constitutional importance whatsoever. Of 101 Labour MPs questioned by BBC1's On the Record, 80% said the Queen should be stripped of all constitutional powers. These people are supposed to be in charge! Why don't they just put their votes where their views are? Because of convention. Why does Tony Blair waste all that time chatting to the Queen, when he has no intention of doing what she says, and she's not going to say anything anyway? Because that's how it's done. Why do we submit to being subjects rather than citizens? Because that's the way it's always been.  If you spend one minute examining their role in the context of logic, rather than tradition, you cannot see the point of them. Even the staunchest monarchists, pressed on this family's purpose, can only come up with one of two things. Either, it's a tourist attraction (which I'd contest - or, better still, offset by building another London Eye). Or, they ask, ""What do we put in their place?"" - well, what indeed? A freely elected president? A toothless but benign head of state? Some kittens?  It doesn't matter, so long as it's been given serious thought; so long as the final decision is reached in accordance with the principles of modern democracy; basically, so long as there is some idea behind it other than ""Let's do what we did last year.""  Now, I'm not necessarily advocating the overthrow of the royal family, since on this issue, more than any other, I feel profoundly indifferent. I merely suggest that they should be a lot more careful, the next time they're tempted to wade imperiously into an issue, thinking to halt our tabloid chattering with one absolute assertion or denial.  Every time they do something they've never done before, however tedious it is, they're clawing through their own safety nets. There may not be much dignity in silence, but there's always a chance we'll forget they're there."
1,"It is hard to believe the Northern Ireland peace process may yet founder. Such a collapse would affront many histories of evolution from civil war to political peace all over the world. The process has come so far. Yet this, of course, is the very reason why, in the end game, the deal may not stick. The rejectionism that has sustained the war for 30 years resists the notion that the peace momentum must lead somewhere. The end is the time when it is put to the only test that counts. The closer this comes, the harder it gets. The two intransigencies on display here are no longer contesting power, still less, in any essential way, religion. Fundamentally, they're about attitudes to the prospect of mutual surrender. The surrenders that have got us this far have been substantial already. But there is just one more surrender to make, the decisive one, which really could liquidate, in the practical world, the violence of the decades. After the years of civil war, in which the ceaseless flow of calumnies and special pleading and implanted deviousness always confused the issue, two forms of real sincerity are now ranged against each other. That is why the challenge may defeat them.  On the republican side, there is a sincere belief that the war is over. The guns are silent, the Semtex is buried. Sinn Fein-IRA, the most disciplined political organisation in Europe, has embarked on a political track which its leaders, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, know they can carry through. They have   taken the republicans very far. Even the IRA, when speaking solo - if namelessly - for itself, asserts that its commitment to the process is ""total"", and says it wants ""a permanent peace"".  Look at what is happening, says Mr Adams. Irish republicanism has given up its constitutional claim to the north. We have carried the terrorists a long way, as the IRA statement proves. We are sitting down and starting to run the country rather than destroying it. We talk with the hated British government. All this shows our renunciation of the past. It is a fantastic, constructive shift. We have chosen a different track, which we can sustain up to and through the deadline of May 22, even against forays by our dissident groups.  The credence to be given to this, moreover, is greater for the length of time over which we resisted it. When we do a U-turn, we are serious. The Good Friday agreement prescribes arms decommissioning by May, but that is not, at bottom, the point. Decommissioning, Mr Adams concedes, is achievable. But the point, he says, is that de facto the war has stopped. To disregard such progress towards an appointment with destiny in May would be to imperil what has been done under the shadow of the undecommissioned, but unused, gun. Let this objectively existing reality be sustained.  On the unionists' side one recognises the same brand of sincerity. By historic standards it is just as startling. The reality of peace has drawn them into credible   politics. They have accepted their republican enemies into power. They are starting to run the place together. They have surmounted the vast obstacles placed in the unionist psyche by memory and worse.  They are still goaded by their own hate-filled supporters, including bits of the London press, who have operated from the start in the hope that the deal will fail, and characterise it relentlessly as a blueprint for gangster rule. These play to the bloody inheritance which unionists believe they alone endured. But the leadership, courageously, has got past that. It sees further. The name is statesmanship. Along with the other partners in Good Friday -London, Dublin, Washington - David Trimble has manoeuvred round the easy negatives which history endorses and on which so many decades of fatalistic rumination have been lavished.   T o this state of mind, the republican analysis could seem quite attractive. It is, after all, true. The war seems to be over. The unionists have taken their own steps towards underwriting this happy development. They have lived with the procrasti nation over decommissioning. They will swallow most of the Patten report on the RUC. The hatreds simmer, and Mr Trimble's enemies gather. But on the unionist side, there have been the same successes as on Sinn Fein's, for realism over viscera. Why can't they take one more stride along this fruitful road - which already leads so far away from the dismal past - even though General de Chastelaine cannot yet report any decommissioning by the IRA?  To most outsiders, not steeped in the all-consuming obsessionalism of Ulster politics, this must be the way it seems. We don't diminish the importance of the arms. We read the agreement, and we know weapons have to start going. We can see the mistrust that has yet to be de-contaminated by the sincerity and the compromises already made. Having swallowed the camel, aren't unionists straining at the gnat? It is a tempting proposition. One more, final-final deadline in May - as against the possible ruination of a process that has already changed so much. When the unionists insist on Mr Trimble keeping his promise to resign if the gnat is not delivered, will the blood not be on their hands?  People say that at this delicate time, it is insensitive to be talking about blame. Republicans, pointing to the absence of war, are particularly prone to that opinion. Mr Adams's optimism, as I say, is sincere enough; and it is remarkable how swiftly his whole demeanour has   changed into that of a governing politician. But especially in this delicate end game, it is important not to mistake the matter. No amount of bluster, or axiomatic assertion, or small-print casuistry, or pseudo-statesmanship can obscure the truth that in the hour of crisis it is the republicans who are on trial.  Realpolitik has done us proud, but there is a limit to its virtues and we have reached it. Basking in the new-found success of Adams's strategy, Sinn Fein-IRA have to take their own small step and make a decisive - though entirely incomplete - surrender. The symbolic gesture, the token handover, is the substantively meaningless but politically crucial event now required if further credence is to be attached to the promises of peace. Only in the vocabulary of IRA self- regard, which demands that their arms and nobody else's are inalienable, does that appear unreasonable.  They say they are serious about peace. Let us believe they mean it, and will continue to deliver - even as they continue to hold, as everyone will know, a secret arsenal. Unfortunately, in the real world, it is not enough to make the promise. The unbearable discomfort of a necessary gesture is required, as proof that republicanism has really entered the world it chose some time ago to belong to.  Everything else, at this late stage, is bunker piety, which not only Ulster unionists will rightly curse.","The politics of law and order are entirely about spin. Not just partly. Entirely.

They believed half of male rapists were sent to prison, whereas the actual figure was 97%. House burglars and muggers   were similarly thought to be let off, when well over half in each category went to jail. Such are the sometimes grotesque misperceptions on which the reputation of the judiciary as a soft touch is based. Yet that's the image brainlessly cultivated by the tabloid press, which then finds its inescapable way into the critique and policies of ministers.  These policies are not always foolish. Serious experts are always trying to get to grips with the aberrations of social and human behaviour. The Thatcher-Major government passed a criminal justice act every year for so long that the later statutes began to undo what the earlier ones had done. The Blair government has a mixed record with its own creative initiatives. Both curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders, much brooded on and ostensibly reasonable, have failed to convince the people in the courts and on the ground, and have come to almost nothing. The latest proposed reforms also have something to be said for them. Explicitly permitting judges to take account of previous convictions when settling a sentence is a rational idea. It addresses the prime problem thrown up by the latest fashionable analysis, the familiar theme that much   crime is committed by no more than 100,000 people. The package looks like serious action. It's intended to be so. It should spin well, though the Tories will, as easily and bewilderingly, spin against it.  But through the murk and counter-murk three conclusions stare out, which confront ministers and their opponents with challenges that spinning doesn't adequately address. First, the best things the government wants to try will cost money. Yesterday's package is priced at £700m. Can this be enough to create the new custodial and semi-custodial regimes ministers talk of, pay courts to work twice as hard to accelerate hearings, and seriously increase police manpower all over the country? Of all remedies for deterrence and detection, common across all these confusing stats and counter-stats, a bigger police force is by far the most persuasive. Quite why Straw has so conspicuously failed to keep promises about police recruitment is a complicated mystery. It may not be entirely about money. But money will help. Is the Treasury committed to providing it for this vastly ambitious programme? Or are we watching mere propaganda sufficient unto May 3?  Second, though Straw, to show his all-round vision, stressed the causes of crime as much as crime itself, and commended the government's education and employment programmes, there's a hole at the heart of the picture. While offering drugs as an explanation for such crime problems   as he will admit to, he won't address the drug laws as a focus for reform, despite pressure and expert argument from those who are just as concerned and responsible as politicians. Decriminalising cannabis would wipe out a certain amount of crime at a stroke, freeing up police and courts for other priorities. The spinners dare not look at it.  Third, they dictate that prisons must go on blithely multiplying. Two of the less disputable current statistics are a) that Britain has the highest proportion of its population in prison of any country in Europe, and b) that, in a league table of crime as experienced by victims, England and Wales, with 58 crimes per 100 inhabitants, came out joint first in the industrialised world. No accountable politician is willing to make a connection between these profoundly interesting trends. The lord chief justice, the inspector of prisons, and the director of the prison service have all recently delivered clinical and passionate critiques of prison. The electoral auctioneers dare not change the terms of the debate.  One reason for this is that spinners can only deal with the lowest denominator of opinion, however ignorant. But the spinner always, more or less, lies. A more fruitful approach is available. The beginning of wisdom in the politics of law and order would be to understand that, since nobody can sort out one spinner from another, someone might start the arduous business of addressing the truth."
0,"It is hard to believe the Northern Ireland peace process may yet founder. Such a collapse would affront many histories of evolution from civil war to political peace all over the world. The process has come so far. Yet this, of course, is the very reason why, in the end game, the deal may not stick. The rejectionism that has sustained the war for 30 years resists the notion that the peace momentum must lead somewhere. The end is the time when it is put to the only test that counts. The closer this comes, the harder it gets. The two intransigencies on display here are no longer contesting power, still less, in any essential way, religion. Fundamentally, they're about attitudes to the prospect of mutual surrender. The surrenders that have got us this far have been substantial already. But there is just one more surrender to make, the decisive one, which really could liquidate, in the practical world, the violence of the decades. After the years of civil war, in which the ceaseless flow of calumnies and special pleading and implanted deviousness always confused the issue, two forms of real sincerity are now ranged against each other. That is why the challenge may defeat them.  On the republican side, there is a sincere belief that the war is over. The guns are silent, the Semtex is buried. Sinn Fein-IRA, the most disciplined political organisation in Europe, has embarked on a political track which its leaders, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, know they can carry through. They have   taken the republicans very far. Even the IRA, when speaking solo - if namelessly - for itself, asserts that its commitment to the process is ""total"", and says it wants ""a permanent peace"".  Look at what is happening, says Mr Adams. Irish republicanism has given up its constitutional claim to the north. We have carried the terrorists a long way, as the IRA statement proves. We are sitting down and starting to run the country rather than destroying it. We talk with the hated British government. All this shows our renunciation of the past. It is a fantastic, constructive shift. We have chosen a different track, which we can sustain up to and through the deadline of May 22, even against forays by our dissident groups.  The credence to be given to this, moreover, is greater for the length of time over which we resisted it. When we do a U-turn, we are serious. The Good Friday agreement prescribes arms decommissioning by May, but that is not, at bottom, the point. Decommissioning, Mr Adams concedes, is achievable. But the point, he says, is that de facto the war has stopped. To disregard such progress towards an appointment with destiny in May would be to imperil what has been done under the shadow of the undecommissioned, but unused, gun. Let this objectively existing reality be sustained.  On the unionists' side one recognises the same brand of sincerity. By historic standards it is just as startling. The reality of peace has drawn them into credible   politics. They have accepted their republican enemies into power. They are starting to run the place together. They have surmounted the vast obstacles placed in the unionist psyche by memory and worse.  They are still goaded by their own hate-filled supporters, including bits of the London press, who have operated from the start in the hope that the deal will fail, and characterise it relentlessly as a blueprint for gangster rule. These play to the bloody inheritance which unionists believe they alone endured. But the leadership, courageously, has got past that. It sees further. The name is statesmanship. Along with the other partners in Good Friday -London, Dublin, Washington - David Trimble has manoeuvred round the easy negatives which history endorses and on which so many decades of fatalistic rumination have been lavished.   T o this state of mind, the republican analysis could seem quite attractive. It is, after all, true. The war seems to be over. The unionists have taken their own steps towards underwriting this happy development. They have lived with the procrasti nation over decommissioning. They will swallow most of the Patten report on the RUC. The hatreds simmer, and Mr Trimble's enemies gather. But on the unionist side, there have been the same successes as on Sinn Fein's, for realism over viscera. Why can't they take one more stride along this fruitful road - which already leads so far away from the dismal past - even though General de Chastelaine cannot yet report any decommissioning by the IRA?  To most outsiders, not steeped in the all-consuming obsessionalism of Ulster politics, this must be the way it seems. We don't diminish the importance of the arms. We read the agreement, and we know weapons have to start going. We can see the mistrust that has yet to be de-contaminated by the sincerity and the compromises already made. Having swallowed the camel, aren't unionists straining at the gnat? It is a tempting proposition. One more, final-final deadline in May - as against the possible ruination of a process that has already changed so much. When the unionists insist on Mr Trimble keeping his promise to resign if the gnat is not delivered, will the blood not be on their hands?  People say that at this delicate time, it is insensitive to be talking about blame. Republicans, pointing to the absence of war, are particularly prone to that opinion. Mr Adams's optimism, as I say, is sincere enough; and it is remarkable how swiftly his whole demeanour has   changed into that of a governing politician. But especially in this delicate end game, it is important not to mistake the matter. No amount of bluster, or axiomatic assertion, or small-print casuistry, or pseudo-statesmanship can obscure the truth that in the hour of crisis it is the republicans who are on trial.  Realpolitik has done us proud, but there is a limit to its virtues and we have reached it. Basking in the new-found success of Adams's strategy, Sinn Fein-IRA have to take their own small step and make a decisive - though entirely incomplete - surrender. The symbolic gesture, the token handover, is the substantively meaningless but politically crucial event now required if further credence is to be attached to the promises of peace. Only in the vocabulary of IRA self- regard, which demands that their arms and nobody else's are inalienable, does that appear unreasonable.  They say they are serious about peace. Let us believe they mean it, and will continue to deliver - even as they continue to hold, as everyone will know, a secret arsenal. Unfortunately, in the real world, it is not enough to make the promise. The unbearable discomfort of a necessary gesture is required, as proof that republicanism has really entered the world it chose some time ago to belong to.  Everything else, at this late stage, is bunker piety, which not only Ulster unionists will rightly curse.","The healthy reaction to the death of a great-grandmother of 100 or so from her family is one of resignation, even quiet relief. She's had a good innings - her three-score years and 10 and then another score and 10. No one wants her to die, but it is entirely human not to be disabled by grief at her passing when her survival would have brought only decline and suffering. If you have similar feelings after the death of the Queen Mother - a woman 99.9 per cent of the country cannot count as a relative or friend - I advise you to keep them to yourself. Her stay in hospital last week revealed to those who work in the 'newzak' business that professional mourners are primed to howl with anguish and to howl down anyone who can't counterfeit pain.A gruesome media underworld starts to rumble whenever there's a royal health scare. BBC executives check if the afflicted is on the 'A-list' consisting of the Queen Mother, Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, or the 'B-list' of Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Edward Wessex and an unfortunate Duke of Edinburgh, who was relegated by the corporation last year - presumably for scoring too many own goals. Death in the premier league guarantees that scheduled programmes are replaced with funereal music before days of commemorative documentaries and moist news reports begin. B-list royals get second-rate tributes.All broadcasters and newspapers, meanwhile, receive holding obituaries, stories and even leading articles from the Press Association news-agency. Last week's flood of anticipatory copy included a suggested editorial for dunderheaded journalists unable to compose one themselves. ('The nation will mourn with gratitude the life of and service of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, ""Queen Mum"" to millions throughout the world.')We learned from a separate piece you may read one day in your morning or evening paper or hear parroted on Radio 4 that as her body lies in state at Westminster Hall, 'vast crowds are expected to queue to file past the coffin. It will be placed high on a purple-draped catafalque on the same spot where King George VI lay in state in February 1952, and will be guarded round-the-clock by a contingent of Gentleman at Arms and Yeomen of the Guard. The ancient hall is an incomparable setting for the public's tribute to the royal lady they have loved and respected...' and so on at a length which might make the most ardent monarchist tear off his culottes.The assumption that the nation will mourn runs through all the mainstream media's pre-cooked packages. And if a handful of perverse dissenters don't wail, they will be after them just as they were after anyone who failed to exhibit the required trauma after the death of Diana Spencer.The shape of things of come could be glimpsed in the News of the World last year when it shrieked at Camelot executives for 'hatching a tasteless plot to protect their Saturday draw if the Queen Mum should die that day'. Their decision to go ahead with the lottery draw and announce the results in the small hours when the grieving bulletins were over for the night was the 'the ultimate in bad taste'.If the nation was grieving, everyone would be too distracted to buy a lottery ticket and Camelot could take the week off. Its emergency planning to please the punters shows that Camelot at least knows that national mourning is not what it was.The great vulgarity of monarchy is its transformation of private life into propaganda. Births, weddings and funerals are used to build customer loyalty to 'The Firm'. Throughout the disasters of the 1990s, courtiers and royalist commentators consoled themselves with the thought that the death of the Queen Mother would pull indifferent or hostile subjects back into line behind her less than perfect family. Extravagant designs for her funeral have been knocking around Whitehall and the media for years in a classified document entitled 'Operation Lion'. Its authors envisage nine days of mourning culminating in the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. The monarchy would define the nation again and dominate its emotions.Anthony Holden, the critical royal biographer, wonders whether Buckingham Palace still has the nerve to implement 'Operation Lion'. 'People will be making comparisons all the time with the numbers Diana's funeral attracted,' he told me. 'Suppose the majority paying their respect are elderly and there's scarcely a young face in sight. Suppose viewers revolt about television being disrupted for nine days. It could be embarrassing.'Indeed it could. Politicians and advertisers are being forced to realise that millions of disillusioned consumers are blanking out their messages. The court and the courtier press should have learned by now that the old levers no longer work. The evidence for boredom with royal marketing has been accumulating for years.The great exception everyone quotes is the death of the ex-Princess of Wales. I wouldn't deny it provoked mass inanity which compelled anyone who believed in the rationality of public life to grab the nearest whisky bottle. But the scale of 'the grief' during those freaky days was exaggerated at the time and has been mythologised since.The day before her funeral the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said he would need almost all his 27,000 officers to control an expected crowd of six million. Two million turned up. A year later on the anniversary of the Paris smash, tribute programmes got abysmal ratings and the failure of public hug fests to attract anything resembling a crowd, or even a huddle, forced the BBC to decide 'most seem to have decided to do their mourning in private'.This was too lame, even for the BBC. Its managers drew a realistic conclusion. They decided not enough viewers wanted to see the pageant for the Queen Mother's one-hundredth birthday and became the object one of the Daily Mail's signature hate campaigns.ITV took over and the BBC grovelled and admitted it was wrong. The week's brutal viewing figures showed the error was on ITV's side. Its Queen Mother special was a lamentable twenty-fifth in the ratings, behind Charlie's Garden Army and a repeat of It'll Be Alright on the Night (VIII).We reported last week that senior courtiers feared that next year's Golden Jubilee celebrations for Elizabeth II may be met by 'a wave of apathy' which could damage the monarchy, so they know something is wrong. What they don't appear to understand is why they're being swamped.A small part of the explanation lies in distaste for the airbrushing of monarchy. Everything I've heard about the television obituaries, and everything I've seen in the Press Association files, suggests that the old line will be recycled that Queen Mother is above politics; have the skill 'to be wholly non-political in the present reign', as the Telegraph said last week.They must know this is drivel and she has the standard prejudices of an aristocrat of her generation. Woodrow Wyatt recorded in his diary of March 1986 the Queen Mother telling him that when the royal family are alone together they 'often drink a toast at the end of dinner to Mrs Thatcher. She adores Mrs Thatcher'.She also adored P.W. Botha when he was President of South Africa and thought the media and black Commonwealth was being beastly about the apartheid regime he managed. She was opposed to women priests, had suspicions of the French, a paradoxical hatred of the Germans and 'reservations' about Jews.When she was Queen, she and George VI broke every constitutional propriety in their eagerness to support Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and oppose Winston Churchill. So great was their complicity that the Public Records Office refuses to release the papers covering the royal fondness for appeasing the Right in the 1930s until after the Queen Mother's death. They would cause 'substantial distress', apparently.Perhaps they would, but in the long term greater and deserved distress is caused to the Windsors' reputation by the sycophancy and evasions of their supporters and the bullying of the millions who see no reason to share their stage-managed pain."
1,"The Millennium Dome is out of sight. Down there in Greenwich, it's a long way from being in your face, even for most Londoners. For the nation, on whose children the prime minister once said the dome should confer ""memories so strong that it gives them that abiding sense of purpose and unity that stays with them through the rest of their lives"", it could be on another planet. But let memory speak, before the monster goes. It has been the most particular and incontestable folly of our time. The physical distance assists the political amnesia. It's hard to find any politician who will talk about the dome now. Lord Falconer shuffles forward to mutter about an exit strategy, while Chris Smith is compelled, as a coda to the disaster the government set in train, to pour another £29m of lottery money down the Greenwich drain, the better to ensure that this exit, selling off the asset for a fraction of what was put into it, can duly happen. The announcement is as blithe as it is insulting. Otherwise, what's past is past, we're told. Time to move on. Time to talk about Tate Modern, an altogether superior monument built from the pockets of the poor who finance the lottery. The dome? Forget it.  This request I cannot meet. Somehow boredom wouldn't measure up. There was such grandeur here that slinking silently away would do an injustice to history. And history was the frame. Greenwich is the home of time, the government said. This was why   Britain had a special duty to put on a millennial event that would lead the world and startle all who came from the ends of the earth to see it. The dome would ""make a statement for the whole nation,"" said Mr Blair. It was the way for us ""to take stock of ourselves"". How, by that test, do we look?  The amount of lottery money consumed on the dome is closing in on £550m. Only half the expected audience have so far been willing to pay out of their own pockets for the experience. For this financial failure, they themselves, the British and global public, are to blame. Damn the punters, they inexplicably found better things to do. So the first thing we look, as a nation, is culpable. We let our prophets down. We didn't do what we were told.  But this was because we were not properly informed. The public is one scapegoat, the media are another. Asked a few awkward questions, Michael Heseltine, who can be called the dome's first begetter, was anticipating this before the money had been spent. ""It's virtually impossible,"" he said, ""to do anything in this country of any imagination without the media trying to vilify and ruin it."" He was highlighting another national defect. We are apparently credulous in overlooking a brilliant creation just because a bunch of malign journalists tell us to. Or so the minister said.  
These are insignificant alibis for the truth. They spread the blame for the humiliating embarrassment the dome has become, so that we are all somehow guilty. Yet there has never been a project that grew so particularly and exclusively out of the preoccupations of the political class, irrespective of party, and the self-glorifying inanity in which its leaders are capable of collaborating as long as someone else pays.  The dome began as a Tory project, the last resounding belch of a dying regime. Promoted by the grandiloquent Heseltine and seized on by the cringing Mr Major, father of the lottery, it was supervised in the early stages by Virginia Bottomley and cheer-led by a variety of architects and propagandists with their own half-baked ideological, not to mention commercial, agenda for this way of proclaiming national greatness past and future - an assertion no other nation in the world felt that 2000 AD required it to make.  An additional rationale was proposed, concerning the renewal of poisoned land on the Greenwich peninsular. But it was never explained why this could be achieved only by the erection of a white elephant consuming, in all, £800m. History, and politics, were at the heart of it. Tories, when drawn into a discussion of their part, still contend that if a thousand years of history   had remained the millennial motif, a triumph was guaranteed. It was New Labour's obsession with modernity, they say, that confused an otherwise flawless project.  But New Labour was on board before the Tories' fall. The consensus was all but sealed. Given the chance in May 1997 to act like a new regime, unneedful of hyperbole, Mr Blair decided he couldn't let the old, dead, corrupted one outflank him in nationalistic display, however pointless. Nobody ever answered the question about what the dome was for, except for that. Miles of verbiage and armies of consultants, up to the very millennial moment, addressed the question of content and purpose, but none was able to improve on Heseltine's best shot: ""It's going to be quite wonderful but don't ask me how"". They still can't. Made manifest before our eyes, the dome declared its irretrievable emptiness.  Many political projects turn out to be less than perfect. Most, indeed, can never hope to succeed in anything but a contingent and partial way. There are always more schools to build and patients to cure. For that reason the political rhetoric attaching to them is almost meant to be taken with a shovelful of salt. The level of pretension is understood to be an aspiration, the money available for its fulfilment is always inadequate. Blaming politicians for their failure is often a ritual that they can deflect with earnest remarks about the sincerity of their efforts. And besides, there's always another party, putting them to the question.  The dome is a different case. Normal lines of responsibility do not exist. It was built with funny money, for which nobody is accountable. The Treasury would never have countenanced tax money being used. No business could have defended such folly to its shareholders. Lottery money, falling outside either discipline, was made available as a plaything for egotistical wasters who invented a national purpose that did not exist. Not a little matter of a few million, either, but a donation of colossal magnitude, deployed by the same people who decided it should be handed out: people of all parties with their fingers in the trough of self-indulgence, leaving none with hands clean enough to do the ensuing scandal justice.  What one misses here is the faintest semblance of regret. No whisper have I heard, from the principals or their auxiliaries, that they may have been responsible for a mistake. Apology seems out of the question. When not whimpering a few resentful words that miss the point, they are silent. They're moving on. The dome was yesterday. Just another well-meaning blip in the awkward lives of politicians committed to national renewal. But it wasn't. It was an avoidable idiocy, which leaves Britain looking like a nation led astray by profligate, self- regarding philistines.","It is hard to believe the Northern Ireland peace process may yet founder.

Promoted by the grandiloquent Heseltine and seized on by the cringing Mr Major, father of the lottery, it was supervised in the early stages by Virginia Bottomley and cheer-led by a variety of architects and propagandists with their own half-baked ideological, not to mention commercial, agenda for this way of proclaiming national greatness past and future - an assertion no other nation in the world felt that 2000 AD required it to make.  An additional rationale was proposed, concerning the renewal of poisoned land on the Greenwich peninsular. But it was never explained why this could be achieved only by the erection of a white elephant consuming, in all, £800m. History, and politics, were at the heart of it. Tories, when drawn into a discussion of their part, still contend that if a thousand years of history   had remained the millennial motif, a triumph was guaranteed. It was New Labour's obsession with modernity, they say, that confused an otherwise flawless project.  But New Labour was on board before the Tories' fall. The consensus was all but sealed. Given the chance in May 1997 to act like a new regime, unneedful of hyperbole, Mr Blair decided he couldn't let the old, dead, corrupted one outflank him in nationalistic display, however pointless. Nobody ever answered the question about what the dome was for, except for that. Miles of verbiage and armies of consultants, up to the very millennial moment, addressed the question of content and purpose, but none was able to improve on Heseltine's best shot: ""It's going to be quite wonderful but don't ask me how"". They still can't. Made manifest before our eyes, the dome declared its irretrievable emptiness.  Many political projects turn out to be less than perfect. Most, indeed, can never hope to succeed in anything but a contingent and partial way. There are always more schools to build and patients to cure. For that reason the political rhetoric attaching to them is almost meant to be taken with a shovelful of salt. The level of pretension is understood to be an aspiration, the money available for its fulfilment is always inadequate. Blaming politicians for their failure is often a ritual that they can deflect with earnest remarks about the sincerity of their efforts. And besides, there's always another party, putting them to the question.  The dome is a different case. Normal lines of responsibility do not exist. It was built with funny money, for which nobody is accountable. The Treasury would never have countenanced tax money being used. No business could have defended such folly to its shareholders. Lottery money, falling outside either discipline, was made available as a plaything for egotistical wasters who invented a national purpose that did not exist. Not a little matter of a few million, either, but a donation of colossal magnitude, deployed by the same people who decided it should be handed out: people of all parties with their fingers in the trough of self-indulgence, leaving none with hands clean enough to do the ensuing scandal justice.  What one misses here is the faintest semblance of regret. No whisper have I heard, from the principals or their auxiliaries, that they may have been responsible for a mistake. Apology seems out of the question. When not whimpering a few resentful words that miss the point, they are silent. They're moving on. The dome was yesterday. Just another well-meaning blip in the awkward lives of politicians committed to national renewal. But it wasn't. It was an avoidable idiocy, which leaves Britain looking like a nation led astray by profligate, self- regarding philistines.","The healthy reaction to the death of a great-grandmother of 100 or so from her family is one of resignation, even quiet relief. She's had a good innings - her three-score years and 10 and then another score and 10. No one wants her to die, but it is entirely human not to be disabled by grief at her passing when her survival would have brought only decline and suffering. If you have similar feelings after the death of the Queen Mother - a woman 99.9 per cent of the country cannot count as a relative or friend - I advise you to keep them to yourself. Her stay in hospital last week revealed to those who work in the 'newzak' business that professional mourners are primed to howl with anguish and to howl down anyone who can't counterfeit pain.A gruesome media underworld starts to rumble whenever there's a royal health scare. BBC executives check if the afflicted is on the 'A-list' consisting of the Queen Mother, Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, or the 'B-list' of Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Edward Wessex and an unfortunate Duke of Edinburgh, who was relegated by the corporation last year - presumably for scoring too many own goals. Death in the premier league guarantees that scheduled programmes are replaced with funereal music before days of commemorative documentaries and moist news reports begin. B-list royals get second-rate tributes.All broadcasters and newspapers, meanwhile, receive holding obituaries, stories and even leading articles from the Press Association news-agency. Last week's flood of anticipatory copy included a suggested editorial for dunderheaded journalists unable to compose one themselves. ('The nation will mourn with gratitude the life of and service of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, ""Queen Mum"" to millions throughout the world.')We learned from a separate piece you may read one day in your morning or evening paper or hear parroted on Radio 4 that as her body lies in state at Westminster Hall, 'vast crowds are expected to queue to file past the coffin. It will be placed high on a purple-draped catafalque on the same spot where King George VI lay in state in February 1952, and will be guarded round-the-clock by a contingent of Gentleman at Arms and Yeomen of the Guard. The ancient hall is an incomparable setting for the public's tribute to the royal lady they have loved and respected...' and so on at a length which might make the most ardent monarchist tear off his culottes.The assumption that the nation will mourn runs through all the mainstream media's pre-cooked packages. And if a handful of perverse dissenters don't wail, they will be after them just as they were after anyone who failed to exhibit the required trauma after the death of Diana Spencer.The shape of things of come could be glimpsed in the News of the World last year when it shrieked at Camelot executives for 'hatching a tasteless plot to protect their Saturday draw if the Queen Mum should die that day'. Their decision to go ahead with the lottery draw and announce the results in the small hours when the grieving bulletins were over for the night was the 'the ultimate in bad taste'.If the nation was grieving, everyone would be too distracted to buy a lottery ticket and Camelot could take the week off. Its emergency planning to please the punters shows that Camelot at least knows that national mourning is not what it was.The great vulgarity of monarchy is its transformation of private life into propaganda. Births, weddings and funerals are used to build customer loyalty to 'The Firm'. Throughout the disasters of the 1990s, courtiers and royalist commentators consoled themselves with the thought that the death of the Queen Mother would pull indifferent or hostile subjects back into line behind her less than perfect family. Extravagant designs for her funeral have been knocking around Whitehall and the media for years in a classified document entitled 'Operation Lion'. Its authors envisage nine days of mourning culminating in the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. The monarchy would define the nation again and dominate its emotions.Anthony Holden, the critical royal biographer, wonders whether Buckingham Palace still has the nerve to implement 'Operation Lion'. 'People will be making comparisons all the time with the numbers Diana's funeral attracted,' he told me. 'Suppose the majority paying their respect are elderly and there's scarcely a young face in sight. Suppose viewers revolt about television being disrupted for nine days. It could be embarrassing.'Indeed it could. Politicians and advertisers are being forced to realise that millions of disillusioned consumers are blanking out their messages. The court and the courtier press should have learned by now that the old levers no longer work. The evidence for boredom with royal marketing has been accumulating for years.The great exception everyone quotes is the death of the ex-Princess of Wales. I wouldn't deny it provoked mass inanity which compelled anyone who believed in the rationality of public life to grab the nearest whisky bottle. But the scale of 'the grief' during those freaky days was exaggerated at the time and has been mythologised since.The day before her funeral the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said he would need almost all his 27,000 officers to control an expected crowd of six million. Two million turned up. A year later on the anniversary of the Paris smash, tribute programmes got abysmal ratings and the failure of public hug fests to attract anything resembling a crowd, or even a huddle, forced the BBC to decide 'most seem to have decided to do their mourning in private'.This was too lame, even for the BBC. Its managers drew a realistic conclusion. They decided not enough viewers wanted to see the pageant for the Queen Mother's one-hundredth birthday and became the object one of the Daily Mail's signature hate campaigns.ITV took over and the BBC grovelled and admitted it was wrong. The week's brutal viewing figures showed the error was on ITV's side. Its Queen Mother special was a lamentable twenty-fifth in the ratings, behind Charlie's Garden Army and a repeat of It'll Be Alright on the Night (VIII).We reported last week that senior courtiers feared that next year's Golden Jubilee celebrations for Elizabeth II may be met by 'a wave of apathy' which could damage the monarchy, so they know something is wrong. What they don't appear to understand is why they're being swamped.A small part of the explanation lies in distaste for the airbrushing of monarchy. Everything I've heard about the television obituaries, and everything I've seen in the Press Association files, suggests that the old line will be recycled that Queen Mother is above politics; have the skill 'to be wholly non-political in the present reign', as the Telegraph said last week.They must know this is drivel and she has the standard prejudices of an aristocrat of her generation. Woodrow Wyatt recorded in his diary of March 1986 the Queen Mother telling him that when the royal family are alone together they 'often drink a toast at the end of dinner to Mrs Thatcher. She adores Mrs Thatcher'.She also adored P.W. Botha when he was President of South Africa and thought the media and black Commonwealth was being beastly about the apartheid regime he managed. She was opposed to women priests, had suspicions of the French, a paradoxical hatred of the Germans and 'reservations' about Jews.When she was Queen, she and George VI broke every constitutional propriety in their eagerness to support Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and oppose Winston Churchill. So great was their complicity that the Public Records Office refuses to release the papers covering the royal fondness for appeasing the Right in the 1930s until after the Queen Mother's death. They would cause 'substantial distress', apparently.Perhaps they would, but in the long term greater and deserved distress is caused to the Windsors' reputation by the sycophancy and evasions of their supporters and the bullying of the millions who see no reason to share their stage-managed pain."
1,"Chelsea's new manager, Jos Mourinho, was signed last week for a reported £5 million a year, while Marks &amp; Spencer's new chief executive, Stuart Rose, received a signing-on fee of £1.25m, and a base salary of £850,000 a year. Both were new records and if either man can bring the turnaround the two organisations seek, presumably they would seem cheap at twice the price. But are Mourinho and Rose accepting their new jobs just for the cash? Ten years ago, even a star football manager and a talented CEO were paid at half today's salaries. If you believe a new book by Sir Michael Marmot, one of Britain's leading experts on health and social behaviour, what is driving men such as Mourinho and Rose is not money but status*.  Both are already very rich. What matters is what the cash signifies. By being rewarded so highly, Rose and Mourinho are confirmed as top dogs; the men with the highest status in relation to their peers. Cash is just the readiest way of keeping score, demonstrating that they are at the top of their respective hierarchies.  Stuart Rose, by saying he needed to show he was hard to get rather than having any appetite for the cash, has con firmed Marmot's thesis. Status counts, as it always has.  This shouldn't be a surprise. Alain de Botton has already mapped the human preoccupation with our relative standing in his bestseller, Status Anxiety. But Marmot has gone much further. He shows that all societies demonstrate the same truth. There is a discernible downward gradient from high-status individuals (and their partners) who live longer, with more satisfying, healthier and contented lives, even if performing allegedly stressful jobs, to those of fractionally lower status.  So it goes on down the hierarchy of whatever status ladder counts in the particular society or subgroup. Oscar winners live four years longer than film stars not so honoured; permanent secretaries in the Civil Service are happier than those even in the immediate grades below them.  What counts, suggests Marmot, is not just the gratification of being admired and respected by others. Social status provides two crucial props to good health and personal well-being. First, you can't be high status without being closely integrated into the social group of which you are part. There is a mountain of evidence that the denser the social networks of which you are a member, the less likely, for example, you are to fall ill. Social intercourse makes us happy and happiness is the best possible shield against illness.  Second, the higher your status, the more control and autonomy you are likely to have over how you live your life and spend your working day. Autonomy spells satisfaction because it gives   greater potential for realising your wants and choices. Again, there is powerful evidence that this control fends off the deep stress that triggers the adverse physical reaction to everything from viral infections to mental disorders.  It is because these drivers are so ubiquitous that Marmot finds a social gradient in every human phenomenon he studies - from obesity to IQ. Thus his theory of a status syndrome. Nor does he have much sympathy with the conservative view or that of the new evolutionary Darwinian psychologists like Stephen Pinker - that the chain of causation runs from our inherited DNA to where we stand in the hierarchy, ie that essentially we are where we are because we were born to be differentially healthy and high-achieving.  The social gradient is so ever-present across the universe of phenomenon in all societies, and the causal impact on health and well-being so irrefutable that it cannot be true that the over-riding driver of who and what we are is our gene pool. Genes may create dispositions; the status syndrome solidifies our lived experience.  Marmot concludes that in a democratic age, the majority are increasingly going to demand a slice of the autonomy, social engagement and respect that those at the top of the social gradient experience - and that this struggle is going to succeed the political battles over equal citizenship rights, the welfare state and even income distribution that have been fought over for the last century.  He has identified an important movement. The popularity of reality TV, which enfranchises the individual viewer and gives him or her a stake in status and celebrity, is surely part of this. So, in another part of the contemporary landscape, is the new willingness of trade union members to threaten strike action, not in the name of socialism as in the 1970s but rather to insist that employers take their issues seriously and respect their claims.  Arguably, the same trend is what lies behind the growth of various fundamentalisms, whether religious, environmental or political. The appeal of the Alpha course asserting the verities of Christianity, the animal rights movement; the fathers' rights campaign and even UKIP and Euroscepticism are that they variously offer their adherents a route to asserting control, status and autonomy.  All are driven by the status syndrome; all find social engagement and more control through what they do. It does not matter whether you approve or disapprove. What we are witnessing is a restless quest for status with a myriad of sub-groups offering their particular route up the social gradient, insisting that what they value is superior to common mores and standards, so offering the necessary status.  The danger is obvious; Jos Mourinho and Stuart Rose, for example, may have assuaged their desire for status, but those who work for them may wonder destructively what their bosses' real motives are, apart from setting a new salary benchmark for the next round of star hirings.  Similarly, there is a selfishness about single-issue political campaigners. In the US, Ralph Nader may be satisfying his desire for status in running for President, but he weakens the opposition to Bush. But we shouldn't underestimate the deep human need on display. Suicide bombers are less driven by the desperation of poverty than their profound sense of shame at their society's standing along with a quest for status that their culture and religion confer.  The political challenge is huge. At home, it is to find a balance between the diversity of a richly pluralist civil society offering a multiplicity of routes to status and the necessary minimum that we must hold in common if society is to stick together.  In foreign policy, it must be to recognise that a willingness to respect the integrity of positions other than the orthodox Western one is a critical component of success, especially against terrorism.  On these questions, the British right, itself fragmented into status-seeking factions, is not at first base; the British left is only fractionally more advanced. These are new questions to which we need better answers - and we need them fast.  * Status Syndrome, Bloomsbury £12.99","Spain has been as obsessed as we would have been - and as Denmark, Holland and Norway recently were. The security is suffocating; the speculation about the bride's dress endless; the interest overwhelming. Yesterday Crown Prince Felipe, scion of the Bourbons and heir to the Spanish throne, drove through the grid-locked streets of Madrid with his new ex-TV presenter wife in an open-topped but bullet proofed Rolls Royce. Glamorous young royals from Europe's 10 monarchies added to the fiesta. Royalty, banned by Franco for 40 years, could hardly be more secure.  If the guests felt they were on a royal wedding treadmill, they were careful not to show it; European monarchy has never had such sustained good PR, and European royals who once expected to go the way of the Russian Romanovs are blinking at their revival - and capitalising on every opportunity to drive home their new popularity.  Ten days ago Denmark's Crown Prince Frederick tied the knot with a Tasmanian lawyer, Mary Donaldson, whom the Danish media have turned into a Danish Princess Diana. Her dress, a dazzling combination of modernity and the medieval (according to Hello! magazine), made great pictures - but then so did the galaxy of gowns, diamonds and rubies at the wedding and parties beforehand. In a celebrity crazed culture, nobody does it better than European royalty  Europe's young royals are emerging as media superstars. Holland's Prince William-Alexander's marriage to Maxima Zorreguita a couple of year's back was another national extravaganza where Europe's monarchies again gathered to luxuriate in their newfound popularity. Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Greece all boast charismatic young princes and princesses as well.  Nor is the House of Windsor indifferent to what is happening. All Europe's royal families, for example, were represented at the Queen's Jubilee, and no European royal marriage is complete without a British representative; if the Queen enjoys an approval rating of 70 per cent, that is nothing beside her European cousins (she is directly related to most of them) whose approval ratings stand between 80 and 90 per cent. The Queen understands better than her fiercely euro-sceptic consort - and Britain's euro-sceptic press - that Princes William and Harry will do well to associate themselves with rising pro-royalty sentiment in Europe. European republicanism is waning, an eccentric creed out of tune with the popular mood.  At one level, European royalty is doing no more than surfing the cult of celebrity; Posh and Becks may get a lot of coverage in Madrid, but Felipe and Letizia are the real thing - and a lot less transient. They are a soap that will run and run, and worth a great deal of media investment. But there is a curious paradox about royalty in an era of democracy; it and its legitimacy only exist because the public allow them to - and if the public is ready to allow monarchy a revered place in the scheme of things, then democratic culture becomes a means of legitimising this least democratic institution of them all.  Nobody is more acutely aware of this paradox than European royalty; it seemed obvious after the war that the cull of monarchs that had happened under fascism and communism would continue. Democracies wouldn't murder their monarchial heads of state, but the consensus was that they would certainly do away with these representatives of aristocratic privilege who had won their status through birth rather than achievement or electoral mandate.  The only escape from extinction was for royalty to transform itself into an impartial representative of all the nation - an aim the Queen embraced in her famous speech in South Africa in 1947. There was still the problem that this representation would be performed by somebody born to it rather than elected, but what monarchy could offer was lifelong continuity and a personal embodiment of the national public interest.  The Queen has managed to pull off the feat she set herself nearly 60 years ago; but so in their different ways have the other European monarchies. Belgium's King Albert and Holland's Queen Beatrix have a direct constitutional role brokering governing coalitions; Sweden's King Carl Gustav and Denmark's Queen Margrethe have both spoken out against anti-immigrant nationalism, Carl Gustav insisting that monarchy can be 'an impartial and unifying symbol'; and Spain's King Juan Carlos famously undercut Spain's post-Franco military revolt and guaranteed parliamentary democracy. Europe's monarchs have made the transition from quintessential expressions of privilege to expressions of the public interest.  But that alone would not have been enough to secure their new favour. Two other deep currents are helping monarchy. The first is European integration. The further development of the European Union (even in Britain where polls report public recognition that we will one day be members of the euro) is understood to be a necessity, but is not greatly loved.  European processes may be rational and even democratic, but Queen Beatrix represents the House of Orange that founded the Dutch Republic and King Juan Carlos the Bourbons who have been Spain's monarchs for nearly as long. They are embedded in national cultures in a way that Brussels institutions can never be. As currencies are lost, national parliaments weakened and armies cut back, monarchs remain symbols of national unity. The young European royals wisely do not complain about the European constitution; it is their ally rather than a threat.  And there is a more ominous trend. We are so accustomed to the presumption that democracy works that we have become blinded to the re-emergence of pre-democratic values along with pre-democratic distribution of wealth. The European royals disporting themselves in Madrid this weekend may adopt a public posture of promoting the public interest, but they are the inheritors of staggering private wealth and privilege solely by virtue of their birth - and to which European society no longer objects.  Indeed European royalty helps legitimise the new inequality by being so ready to marry ordinary professionals - Letizia Ortiz was a TV presenter, Mary Donaldson a lawyer and Maxima Zorreguieta an economist - and lift them into the celebrity network. Weddings of Crown Princes to commoners have become a bit like Oscar celebrations, spectacles which are for the people's benefit, but which by the bye legitimise fabulous inequality of both wealth and opportunity.  But here is the rub. Whatever your reactions, this is an uniquely European phenomenon understandable only in European terms. European royalty stands and falls together. It was at risk collectively in the first half of the last century; it is on the rise collectively in the first half of this. It is inescapably part of the European landscape. Conservatives like to portray Britain as closer to the US than Europe, part of a dynamic 'Anglo-sphere'. They misdescribe reality. Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage."

Peter Mandelson is on the radio, sounding historic. He asks us to reflect on the ""enormity"" of what has happened this week. I check it in the OED: ""enormity - a monstrous wickedness, a crime or monstrous offence."" Another word lost to the language.  Belfast is as I remember it - permanently wet. The taxi roars up to Stormont, past the triumphalist Carson statue - how long can that survive? - to the massive parliament building, an edifice of a size and grandeur which would be appropriate if its denizens governed the Hapsburg empire, but which in this small, outlying province looks merely ridiculous.  It was here 30 years ago that I heard Brian Faulkner, the last Unionist prime minister, offer places in government to nationalist politicians - a deal not unlike the one which has just been agreed. But that was in the earliest days of the troubles; they would get much worse, 3,000 dead worse, and Faulkner's offer was as pointless as sticking a traffic cone in front of a tank.  You can tell how historic an event is deemed to be by the number of satellite TV trucks parked outside. Today I can see 13 - good news for history fans since that implies the story could make the Associated Press top twenty of the year's historic news events, somewhere between the Indian elections and the fall of Jeffrey Archer.  Inside the building we wait for the new executive to turn up. William Hague came in the morning, but no one seems to have noticed. Finally a Sinn Fein party walked down the great staircase, past the statue of Lord Carnarvon, and addressed us, looking as they generally do, sour but historic.  Gerry Adams spoke in Irish, then in English, but it didn't make any difference,   since his words were lost, bouncing off the vast marble walls, the carved stone, the lavish brasswork, the painted ceiling and the massive chandeliers.  Lord Carnarvon would have considered this lot Fenian bogtrotters. The sight of them standing in the midst of that splendour - ""a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people"" as it was called - might have made his statue crumble, but it was still upright when the party went back up, affording us the chance to notice that Gerry Adams climbs stairs rather like Groucho Marx, which is something you don't see on TV.  The executive met for the first time at 3pm. I followed up the stairs to hear the   Rev Ian Paisley, whose DUP is refusing to sit in the executive along with Sinn Fein, but whose ministers will take part in government and committees.  Paisley is an unchanging constant, and you could measure the progress of the troubles by the whitening of his hair. ""I have been told this is a daybreak - but there is no daybreak for the children of Northern Ireland!""  He claimed - Paisley always has a scoop - that Bairbre de Brun, the Sinn Fein health minister, was demanding to know the religious affiliation of civil servants, so that she could sack the Protestants. Paisley's enduring appeal to his electorate is that he treats the Unionists as if they were   the oppressed minority. On and on he roared.  ""You, the press, have told wicked lies! This is no new daybreak. It is a new night, and we do not know what midnight will bring!"" I would have written more, but my Pentel which writes letters of fire had run out.  As he ploughed on, the DUP assemblymen around him looked first embarrassed and then bored. Their evident ennui near their leader may be a hopeful sign.  Messrs Trimble and Mallon emerged from the historic first meeting to report historically good progress. They were heckled. ""What about those who were   murdered?"" shouted someone, who could have come from either side. In the crush I found myself jammed up against Martin McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff who is now education minister. He is a big man, and was wearing a well-cut suit, with neatly trimmed hair and highly polished shoes.  He looked like a minister, not a terrorist. Why was I just faintly reminded of the last chapter of Animal Farm?"

Ten days ago Denmark's Crown Prince Frederick tied the knot with a Tasmanian lawyer, Mary Donaldson, whom the Danish media have turned into a Danish Princess Diana. Her dress, a dazzling combination of modernity and the medieval (according to Hello! magazine), made great pictures - but then so did the galaxy of gowns, diamonds and rubies at the wedding and parties beforehand. In a celebrity crazed culture, nobody does it better than European royalty  Europe's young royals are emerging as media superstars. Holland's Prince William-Alexander's marriage to Maxima Zorreguita a couple of year's back was another national extravaganza where Europe's monarchies again gathered to luxuriate in their newfound popularity. Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Greece all boast charismatic young princes and princesses as well.  Nor is the House of Windsor indifferent to what is happening. All Europe's royal families, for example, were represented at the Queen's Jubilee, and no European royal marriage is complete without a British representative; if the Queen enjoys an approval rating of 70 per cent, that is nothing beside her European cousins (she is directly related to most of them) whose approval ratings stand between 80 and 90 per cent. The Queen understands better than her fiercely euro-sceptic consort - and Britain's euro-sceptic press - that Princes William and Harry will do well to associate themselves with rising pro-royalty sentiment in Europe. European republicanism is waning, an eccentric creed out of tune with the popular mood.  At one level, European royalty is doing no more than surfing the cult of celebrity; Posh and Becks may get a lot of coverage in Madrid, but Felipe and Letizia are the real thing - and a lot less transient. They are a soap that will run and run, and worth a great deal of media investment. But there is a curious paradox about royalty in an era of democracy; it and its legitimacy only exist because the public allow them to - and if the public is ready to allow monarchy a revered place in the scheme of things, then democratic culture becomes a means of legitimising this least democratic institution of them all.  Nobody is more acutely aware of this paradox than European royalty; it seemed obvious after the war that the cull of monarchs that had happened under fascism and communism would continue. Democracies wouldn't murder their monarchial heads of state, but the consensus was that they would certainly do away with these representatives of aristocratic privilege who had won their status through birth rather than achievement or electoral mandate.  The only escape from extinction was for royalty to transform itself into an impartial representative of all the nation - an aim the Queen embraced in her famous speech in South Africa in 1947. There was still the problem that this representation would be performed by somebody born to it rather than elected, but what monarchy could offer was lifelong continuity and a personal embodiment of the national public interest.  The Queen has managed to pull off the feat she set herself nearly 60 years ago; but so in their different ways have the other European monarchies. Belgium's King Albert and Holland's Queen Beatrix have a direct constitutional role brokering governing coalitions; Sweden's King Carl Gustav and Denmark's Queen Margrethe have both spoken out against anti-immigrant nationalism, Carl Gustav insisting that monarchy can be 'an impartial and unifying symbol'; and Spain's King Juan Carlos famously undercut Spain's post-Franco military revolt and guaranteed parliamentary democracy. Europe's monarchs have made the transition from quintessential expressions of privilege to expressions of the public interest.  But that alone would not have been enough to secure their new favour. Two other deep currents are helping monarchy. The first is European integration. The further development of the European Union (even in Britain where polls report public recognition that we will one day be members of the euro) is understood to be a necessity, but is not greatly loved.  European processes may be rational and even democratic, but Queen Beatrix represents the House of Orange that founded the Dutch Republic and King Juan Carlos the Bourbons who have been Spain's monarchs for nearly as long. They are embedded in national cultures in a way that Brussels institutions can never be. As currencies are lost, national parliaments weakened and armies cut back, monarchs remain symbols of national unity. The young European royals wisely do not complain about the European constitution; it is their ally rather than a threat.  And there is a more ominous trend. We are so accustomed to the presumption that democracy works that we have become blinded to the re-emergence of pre-democratic values along with pre-democratic distribution of wealth. The European royals disporting themselves in Madrid this weekend may adopt a public posture of promoting the public interest, but they are the inheritors of staggering private wealth and privilege solely by virtue of their birth - and to which European society no longer objects.  Indeed European royalty helps legitimise the new inequality by being so ready to marry ordinary professionals - Letizia Ortiz was a TV presenter, Mary Donaldson a lawyer and Maxima Zorreguieta an economist - and lift them into the celebrity network. Weddings of Crown Princes to commoners have become a bit like Oscar celebrations, spectacles which are for the people's benefit, but which by the bye legitimise fabulous inequality of both wealth and opportunity.  But here is the rub. Whatever your reactions, this is an uniquely European phenomenon understandable only in European terms. European royalty stands and falls together. It was at risk collectively in the first half of the last century; it is on the rise collectively in the first half of this. It is inescapably part of the European landscape. Conservatives like to portray Britain as closer to the US than Europe, part of a dynamic 'Anglo-sphere'. They misdescribe reality. Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage.","Dewsbury, New Southgate, Small Heath, Stockwell and, on Friday, the most telling pictures of all - the two suspected bombers appearing on the terrace of their Peabody Estate flat in west London. It's been a catalogue of familiar terrace and semi-detached houses intermingled with housing estate flats that seem indistinguishable, whether in London, Birmingham or Yorkshire; a snapshot of Britain's not-so-glorious underbelly but a vivid visual reminder that the men who have murdered us, or tried to, were either born and bred in Britain or made their homes here.The ties that bind and the minimal shared assumptions that might fend off savage hatred have not operated; these are men so disaffected with Britishness that they have sought identity and meaning in the doctrines of jihad, martyrdom and the casting of their fellow citizens as valueless infidel who can be murdered without conscience. Nor are they alone. They represent a vital sub-culture that may be a minority but is growing and casts long shadows among the generality of British Muslims. In New Southgate we watched a young British Muslim outside the ninth floor flat of a suspected bomber express his sympathy with the ideas of martyrdom.It's a disconnect that is more general; when the reportedly rational leader of Birmingham's Central Mosque says that he does not trust the word of the police and government about the Islamic identity of the bombers, it is symbolic of what has happened. Britain, the writ of Britishness and what seems obvious to the rest of us leaves a critical mass of British Muslims cold; they refuse to believe what is palpably true. Whatever mix of responses you think are needed to lift the threat of the bombs - changing British foreign policy or sharper intelligence - part of the story will have to be persuading young British Muslims that Britishness is an idea worth a minimal degree of loyalty that inhibits mass murder. The question is whether it's up to such a task. Do the British even have a shared conception of what our identity is?This is a debate where the markers are already being put down by the ascendant right, and the undertones are ugly. Britain is in this vulnerable position, runs the argument, because it has been too liberal across the board - from allowing asylum seekers from Somalia and Eritrea to carelessness about non-English speaking imams spreading jihad in British mosques. On that bridgehead of shared concern, it's not hard to take the conservative argument further; Britain is too polyglot, access to its generous welfare state is too easy and there's been too much concern for tolerance, observance of human rights and concern for the underdog. And this speaks to a so far unspoken but just below the surface sentiment; Enoch Powell's warning that the streets would one day run with blood has been proved right. Britishness must be recast around conservative values and the same mistake not made again.This is all too combustible tinder, but one of the paradoxical saving graces of Britishness is that it is too vague an idea to be deployed in such a way. Whether Norman Davies documenting how Britain has been constructed from successive waves of immigration in The Isles, or historian Linda Colley describing how Britain was essentially an eighteenth century political artefact as the result of the union of England, Wales and Scotland in Britons, both unite to show how the idea of Britain is not a faith like the idea of, say, France, or America - or nationalistic like the idea of China or Russia.It's a political jurisdiction that has common practical mores while allowing our emotional identity to be rooted in one of the tribes from which the country has been constituted over time - English, Welsh, Scottish, Jews - and for immigrants, India, Nigeria or Barbados.Even if we want to make Britishness more assertive and conservative or even to harden it into a citizenship test, it won't wash. One of the reasons Euroscepticism is so difficult to counter in Britain is that beyond the shared political symbols of British sovereignty there's not much more that's common to the story - which is why sovereignty counts so much.You can tell a story of Britain that is about Gray's Elegy, the James I Bible, D-Day and Elgar; or you can tell a story of Britain about the Levellers, Methodists, Monty Python and Willam Wallace. The idea encompasses multiple traditions, stories, tribes and eccentricities; belonging means little more than speaking the language, recognising the complexities and achievements while acknowledging the minimal rules that flow from the political arrangements. The tolerance is in the DNA.The problem for Pakistanis, Eritreans and Somalians is that the tribe to which they emotionally belong within the British accommodation does not command anything like the same loyalty as being British English, British Indian or even British Jamaican. Being British and English, or British and Indian works; being British Pakistani or Eritrean does not. They come from broken-backed countries that have no proud history, culture or identity - Pakistan, for example, is only 58 years old: the identity that makes more proud sense is Islam. And in one jump young British Muslim Somalians, Eritreans and Pakistanis are suddenly in the vortex of a culture and religion profoundly wounded by globalisation, Western foreign policy and its own failure to match the rise of Christendom - with all its capacity to transmute a doctrine of peace into a doctrine of sexism, murder and anti-semitism.Nobody can be sure how it will end, but trying to concoct a new urgent conservative British faith as part of a concerted effort to persuade young British Muslims of the value of their adopted country will not be part of any solution - however much some may wish it. Britishness does not admit of such manipulation, which is why millions of British are so loyal to the idea even while not being overtly loud about it. What will happen, I suspect, is that the British will carry on with their understated Britishness while keeping the invitation open - even to jihadist-inclined British Muslims whose parents came from Eritrea, Somalia and Pakistan - to join the club because in the end, however sorely tempted we are, the invitation can't be withdrawn.It's not how British identity is emotionally constituted. And enough British Muslims will find the same value in the co-existing identities to resist the temptations of jihad, and to marginalize the wannabe murderers in their midst. Indeed, it may be in Britain that radical Islam meets its match; and where Islam starts to convert to modernity. Long odds, maybe - but not impossible."

Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage.","The News of the World heaves with self-righteous anger. Mr Richard Desmond's fine Daily Star bathes in fury. The words of James Bulger's mother Denise are spread large across every sheet and TV station in the land: ""I know that no matter where they go, someone out there is waiting."" It is difficult not to feel ashamed of this country. We tut-tut, pruriently horrified, over the public execution of Timothy McVeigh. Our landslide prime minister joins with other EU luminaries to wag a consolidated finger at George Bush's punishing beliefs. Yet any civilised nation, anywhere in the world, would cringe over the punishment we are inflicting on Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Take one dreadful tragedy, stir relentlessly over a decade; then await tragedy renewed.  Some day soon - on an internet website, in a magazine bought at Milan or Madrid airport, after a punch in a pub or a stroke of vile luck - these two 18-year-olds will be ""exposed"". The law is an ass if it thinks that it can guarantee lifelong anonymity to the pair for much over five minutes. What else are ""communities"" but neighbourhoods that watch and talk together?  We may lament such exposure, a continuance of our shame. But big secrets can't be kept forever in a small country. This, more balefully yet, is the old Spycatcher syndrome: judges and politicians don't decide - they have to persuade. And where, pray, is that persuasion?   David Blunkett - at least in the beginning - doesn't even try. He issues one of those the-parole-board-has-informed-me statements which, barely between the lines, says: my hands are tied. The home secretary apparently thinks that holders of his great office, like Michael Howard, avid readers of the tabloids and public-opinion polls are better custodians of juvenile murderers than the judges who heard their cases or the psychologists who have worked to redeem them. European human rights? Forget it. Let's see if we can turn back the clock.  What could his statement - or yesterday's slightly more responsive call for calm - have said?  That here were two kids from fractured, disrupted homes which society - our society - left to fend for themselves. Already victims. They were 10 years old, falling out of the system. They killed a toddler; and the revulsion there is palpable. But what was supposed to happen next? A dose of the junior McVeighs? Obscenely ridiculous. A lifetime behind bars, without hope of release? Barely less obscene. These boys hadn't even had the chance to fail their 11-plus.  Nowhere in mainland Europe is the age of criminal responsibility as low as it is here. Thirteen in Holland, 15 in Denmark, 16 in Spain, 18 in Luxembourg. Anywhere on the continent, Thompson and Venables would not have found themselves in some panoplied crown court listening to men in wigs deciding their fate in language they could not comprehend. They would have been taken away and tended in obscurity - because they were children.  That, in a way, happened here, too. Our secure units are one of the better bits of the system. Robert and Jon have had the care they needed. They have grown up, found themselves and education and remorse. They have come to terms with their malign past. We call it rehabilitation.  Everybody in a position to assess them thinks that they should be released to try to build lives which can never be normal but can, perhaps, be useful and fulfilling. Nobody who knows them today thinks that they should be spun over into adult prisonhood where all the work (and money) invested would surely go to malign waste.  But - David Blunkett could have added - all this patient toil and love stands in pawn today: not from the efforts of those securely inside the unit, but from those outside in the society which first created Thompson and Venables. We dragged them through those adult courts that Europe would despise. We politicians joined the cry for retribution. We judges - like Mr Justice Morland in the case - stripped Child A and Child B of their anonymity so that the flames were fed. We journalists wove the boys of 18 and the kids of 10 into a seamless robe of supposed responsibility. All that was wrong and foolish. We saw the public wrath, the parental grief, and we trembled before it - or rode it out for our own ends. Shame on us.  From that, in turn, inevitably flows the vital factor missing in this equation. Again, ourselves. The courts, which still look inward, clutching their majesty, have ordered lifelong anonymity for these new personalities released into the world.  Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss fears vigilantes hunting two ""uniquely notorious"" lads - ""a real possibility of serious physical harm and possible death from members of the public or from the Bulger family"". Thus the cloaks are cut to cover them while they live. Her injunctions - which may well be doomed because they strain at reality - are only half the story, though.  Lay it out in the clearest terms. This is also our test. So-called ""vigilantes"" are deluded thugs. The pain of the Bulger family is felt but, prolonged indefinitely, it merely builds further tragedy on tragedy. Denise Fergus has other children now: they deserve their normality, too. The memory of Jamie Bulger is best honoured not by vows of eternal revenge, but by closing that door on the past.  The direst test comes not when Thompson and Venables are slipped into the outside world. It comes when, and if, they are discovered. Another media feeding frenzy? More photo-ops for placard wavers? More interviews with outraged neighbours? More politicians hopping up and down and judges eating their dignity?  No: the test is whether, even uncovered, they can be brought to live in peace, to be known but not threatened or ostracised, to be treated for what they have become not what - in childhood - they were. It is a test of our civilisation and our maturity. And leaders who are elected to lead, like home secretaries - should set in directly.  All we have, for the moment, is a dawning of concern (with Ann Widdecombe, to her credit, rather more forthright rather earlier than David Blunkett). But this release is not some neutral act by yet another panel of experts who can be duly excoriated if it goes wrong. It is a decision taken on our behalf because that is the way we have chosen to order our affairs and define our self-image. No ifs, no buts, no facile cop-outs about how five or 10 years more behind bars would have made everyone happier.  Be honest: the time would never have been right. The edge of adulthood is the only point to choose. Heart-searching begins here: and if the home secretary isn't searching hard enough, then the prime minister should be. What's the point of a committed Christian who bites his tongue?"

The further development of the European Union (even in Britain where polls report public recognition that we will one day be members of the euro) is understood to be a necessity, but is not greatly loved.  European processes may be rational and even democratic, but Queen Beatrix represents the House of Orange that founded the Dutch Republic and King Juan Carlos the Bourbons who have been Spain's monarchs for nearly as long. They are embedded in national cultures in a way that Brussels institutions can never be. As currencies are lost, national parliaments weakened and armies cut back, monarchs remain symbols of national unity. The young European royals wisely do not complain about the European constitution; it is their ally rather than a threat.  And there is a more ominous trend. We are so accustomed to the presumption that democracy works that we have become blinded to the re-emergence of pre-democratic values along with pre-democratic distribution of wealth. The European royals disporting themselves in Madrid this weekend may adopt a public posture of promoting the public interest, but they are the inheritors of staggering private wealth and privilege solely by virtue of their birth - and to which European society no longer objects.  Indeed European royalty helps legitimise the new inequality by being so ready to marry ordinary professionals - Letizia Ortiz was a TV presenter, Mary Donaldson a lawyer and Maxima Zorreguieta an economist - and lift them into the celebrity network. Weddings of Crown Princes to commoners have become a bit like Oscar celebrations, spectacles which are for the people's benefit, but which by the bye legitimise fabulous inequality of both wealth and opportunity.  But here is the rub. Whatever your reactions, this is an uniquely European phenomenon understandable only in European terms. European royalty stands and falls together. It was at risk collectively in the first half of the last century; it is on the rise collectively in the first half of this. It is inescapably part of the European landscape. Conservatives like to portray Britain as closer to the US than Europe, part of a dynamic 'Anglo-sphere'. They misdescribe reality. Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage."
0,"Dewsbury, New Southgate, Small Heath, Stockwell and, on Friday, the most telling pictures of all - the two suspected bombers appearing on the terrace of their Peabody Estate flat in west London. It's been a catalogue of familiar terrace and semi-detached houses intermingled with housing estate flats that seem indistinguishable, whether in London, Birmingham or Yorkshire; a snapshot of Britain's not-so-glorious underbelly but a vivid visual reminder that the men who have murdered us, or tried to, were either born and bred in Britain or made their homes here.The ties that bind and the minimal shared assumptions that might fend off savage hatred have not operated; these are men so disaffected with Britishness that they have sought identity and meaning in the doctrines of jihad, martyrdom and the casting of their fellow citizens as valueless infidel who can be murdered without conscience. Nor are they alone. They represent a vital sub-culture that may be a minority but is growing and casts long shadows among the generality of British Muslims. In New Southgate we watched a young British Muslim outside the ninth floor flat of a suspected bomber express his sympathy with the ideas of martyrdom.It's a disconnect that is more general; when the reportedly rational leader of Birmingham's Central Mosque says that he does not trust the word of the police and government about the Islamic identity of the bombers, it is symbolic of what has happened. Britain, the writ of Britishness and what seems obvious to the rest of us leaves a critical mass of British Muslims cold; they refuse to believe what is palpably true. Whatever mix of responses you think are needed to lift the threat of the bombs - changing British foreign policy or sharper intelligence - part of the story will have to be persuading young British Muslims that Britishness is an idea worth a minimal degree of loyalty that inhibits mass murder. The question is whether it's up to such a task. Do the British even have a shared conception of what our identity is?This is a debate where the markers are already being put down by the ascendant right, and the undertones are ugly. Britain is in this vulnerable position, runs the argument, because it has been too liberal across the board - from allowing asylum seekers from Somalia and Eritrea to carelessness about non-English speaking imams spreading jihad in British mosques. On that bridgehead of shared concern, it's not hard to take the conservative argument further; Britain is too polyglot, access to its generous welfare state is too easy and there's been too much concern for tolerance, observance of human rights and concern for the underdog. And this speaks to a so far unspoken but just below the surface sentiment; Enoch Powell's warning that the streets would one day run with blood has been proved right. Britishness must be recast around conservative values and the same mistake not made again.This is all too combustible tinder, but one of the paradoxical saving graces of Britishness is that it is too vague an idea to be deployed in such a way. Whether Norman Davies documenting how Britain has been constructed from successive waves of immigration in The Isles, or historian Linda Colley describing how Britain was essentially an eighteenth century political artefact as the result of the union of England, Wales and Scotland in Britons, both unite to show how the idea of Britain is not a faith like the idea of, say, France, or America - or nationalistic like the idea of China or Russia.It's a political jurisdiction that has common practical mores while allowing our emotional identity to be rooted in one of the tribes from which the country has been constituted over time - English, Welsh, Scottish, Jews - and for immigrants, India, Nigeria or Barbados.Even if we want to make Britishness more assertive and conservative or even to harden it into a citizenship test, it won't wash. One of the reasons Euroscepticism is so difficult to counter in Britain is that beyond the shared political symbols of British sovereignty there's not much more that's common to the story - which is why sovereignty counts so much.You can tell a story of Britain that is about Gray's Elegy, the James I Bible, D-Day and Elgar; or you can tell a story of Britain about the Levellers, Methodists, Monty Python and Willam Wallace. The idea encompasses multiple traditions, stories, tribes and eccentricities; belonging means little more than speaking the language, recognising the complexities and achievements while acknowledging the minimal rules that flow from the political arrangements. The tolerance is in the DNA.The problem for Pakistanis, Eritreans and Somalians is that the tribe to which they emotionally belong within the British accommodation does not command anything like the same loyalty as being British English, British Indian or even British Jamaican. Being British and English, or British and Indian works; being British Pakistani or Eritrean does not. They come from broken-backed countries that have no proud history, culture or identity - Pakistan, for example, is only 58 years old: the identity that makes more proud sense is Islam. And in one jump young British Muslim Somalians, Eritreans and Pakistanis are suddenly in the vortex of a culture and religion profoundly wounded by globalisation, Western foreign policy and its own failure to match the rise of Christendom - with all its capacity to transmute a doctrine of peace into a doctrine of sexism, murder and anti-semitism.Nobody can be sure how it will end, but trying to concoct a new urgent conservative British faith as part of a concerted effort to persuade young British Muslims of the value of their adopted country will not be part of any solution - however much some may wish it. Britishness does not admit of such manipulation, which is why millions of British are so loyal to the idea even while not being overtly loud about it. What will happen, I suspect, is that the British will carry on with their understated Britishness while keeping the invitation open - even to jihadist-inclined British Muslims whose parents came from Eritrea, Somalia and Pakistan - to join the club because in the end, however sorely tempted we are, the invitation can't be withdrawn.It's not how British identity is emotionally constituted. And enough British Muslims will find the same value in the co-existing identities to resist the temptations of jihad, and to marginalize the wannabe murderers in their midst. Indeed, it may be in Britain that radical Islam meets its match; and where Islam starts to convert to modernity. Long odds, maybe - but not impossible.","At a time like this Sir Ian Blair can perhaps be excused his historical exaggeration. The hunt for the London suicide bombers, the Scotland Yard commissioner says, is the biggest challenge that the Metropolitan police have ever faced.I'm sorry, Sir Ian, but that's just not true. Bigger than Chartism? Bigger than the Fenians? Bigger than the unemployed demonstrations in the 1880s? Bigger than the Mosleyites in the 1930s? Bigger than the Blitz? Bigger than the urban riots of the 1980s? With respect, I think not.For large parts of the Met's history - perhaps indeed for most of it - Londoners and their police have not lived easily together. The police were imposed on London in the riotous 1820s, and the imposition defined the relationship for decades to come - until well into my lifetime. Policing with consent may be the buzz phrase today but it was not always so. For most of its history the Met tried to recruit from outside London - from the army and from Scotland in particular - in order to maintain a distance from, not a closeness to, the London community. The mythology summed up in the old Dixon of Dock Green image of the 1950s was very largely just that, mythology.That's not to say that there was no truth in the image of the local, avuncular bobby. But it was never the whole story. In Cold Bath Fields in 1833, just around the corner from where the Guardian's offices now stand, police attacked a political reform meeting without provocation and an officer, Constable Culley, was killed by the crowd. Local people made their views clear when a coroner's jury brought in the astonishing verdict of ""justifiable homicide"". Not much community policing there.And so it continued. Half a century later, when police trampled a bystander to death in the original Bloody Sunday riots of 1887, the funeral generated one of the largest and angriest crowds of the 19th century. As the coffin of Alfred Linnell - decorated with the words Killed in Trafalgar Square - was carried to Bow cemetery, the police were greeted with repeated chants of: ""That's your work!"" Shades of Blair Peach a century later.What the Metropolitan police need, Margaret Thatcher once said in that peremptory way of hers, is ""support not criticism"". Yet this was never a universal view. Most people accepted the police, then as now. But support had to be won, and too often it was not. Not for nothing did one young Londoner, Alfred Hitchcock, sum up his views of the police in ways many shared. ""I'm not against the police,"" the great film-maker once declared. ""I'm just afraid of them.""It is hardly surprising that those kinds of views are being expressed yet again this week, after the Met shot Jean Charles de Menezes dead on a tube train last Friday. In the aftermath of this month's bombings there may be as many as 3,000 armed police on the capital's streets, a number that far exceeds either the Met's specialist armed response units or the armed police who guard key public figures and important buildings. In current circumstances that's an awful lot of people in our midst who are all a hair's breadth away from firing at a suspect. With the revelation of the ""shoot to kill to protect"" policy, suspicions must be expected and questions answered. Like Hitchcock, reasonable people may be afraid. The Commons home affairs committee ought to sit immediately.Shootings by the police still remain incredibly rare in this country. In most places, years can go by between one police bullet being fired and the next. But the key question is when it is legitimate. From what has been reported, the officer who killed the young Brazilian last week appeared to act in line with the rules issued under Lord Stevens. In extreme circumstances, he said, an armed officer can shoot a suspect in the head if the intelligence suggests that he is a suicide bomber who poses an imminent danger to the public or the police.At first sight this could be depicted as a radical extension of police guidelines. But is it? A closer examination reveals that it is more a particularisation of appropriate rules that have governed firearm use by police and the military in Britain, especially Northern Ireland, over many years. These rules contain a number of basic principles: that any force used should be the minimum necessary, that force should be used against particular targets rather than indiscriminately, that no more rounds should be fired than is necessary, that an audible warning must be given and that the officer should be certain that the suspect is about to take offensive action.What is important, though, is that the guidelines do not have the full force of the law unless and until they are tested in court. Now, tragically, we have such a case and the issues must be put to the test. Part of one's heart sinks. Matters of this kind have been a legal battleground in Northern Ireland for decades, not least in the Saville inquiry, mainly because of republicans' determination to depict themselves as the victims of British state violence but also because there are real issues of liberty and law at stake. Even Northern Ireland's often-maligned courts have found, for instance, that the mere failure of a suspect to halt when challenged does not justify shooting him.We need to be prepared to make a similar distinction in the De Menezes case. Just because some mischief makers are already trying to imply that the Met has a shoot-to-kill policy against young, dark-skinned men - which it doesn't - this does not absolve either the Met in general or the officers involved from having to answer for their decisions before a proper tribunal. An innocent man has been killed in the effort to protect other innocent people. That action must be judged. That would happen in Iraq and Israel - and in the British army. It should happen here too.The police should not panic about this. Over the past 25 years, largely since the Scarman report, there has been more reform of London's police than in the preceding century and a half. A police force has become a police service. The quality of leadership has been transformed - compare Ian Blair with David McNee - as have the quality and diversity of its officers. Much remains undone. There are too many boys with toys. Politicians still veer away from constructive criticism of the police.But this should not blind us to what has changed. The relationship between the police and Londoners is unrecognisable from what it was. In the McNee era there would have been no apologies and the force would have drawn tightly together, maligning the critics rather than facing up to the criticism. In the Blair era that is not necessary. Dreadful errors will still happen, from which lessons must be learned. The police are not magicians. But the public has learned to trust the police, errors and all, and I think they are right to do so."
1,"It is the question republicans have learned to fear. ""All right then,"" says the smiling royalist, ""let's say you go ahead and abolish the monarchy. What would you put in its place?"" Variations of that question have proved lethal for reformers. In Britain the republican cause has been held back for years by two words: President Thatcher. Or, put another way, President Hattersley. Tune in to any of the now regular phone-ins and TV debates on the monarchy and you'll soon hear a defender of the status quo winning over his audience by conjuring up a dread prospect of the future.  In Australia that trap proved fatal for the republican movement. Polls showed that more than 70% of Australians wanted to elect their own head of state. Yet the 1999 referendum proposing to remove the Queen as Oz's national figurehead failed because voters did not like the replacement on offer, a ""politicians' president"" chosen by the Canberra parliament.  That result left British reformers with a challenge, forcing them to realise that it was not enough simply to rail against the present order: they would have to explain how any future change would work.  The first move, as made clear both by David McKie and in today's editorial, is to address the crown prerogative. Many lawyers, scholars and activists now agree that ""the crown"" underpins and explains many if not most of the excesses and distortions of our current governmental set-up. But what would reform of such a nebulous, shadowy concept entail? What would abolition of the crown mean?  At first glance, such a drastic move might seem just too vast - like whipping out the ground from underneath our feet. Everything would have to change - from our land law, which technically makes every freeholder the mere owner of an interest in the land of the monarch, to our courts, which currently present every case as The Crown or Regina vs. Joe Bloggs.  In fact, it would not be that complicated. Legally, the notional entity of the crown could simply be replaced by ""the state"" or, where it's more honest, ""the government"" or even, perhaps in criminal court cases, by ""the people."" Each one of these would be abstract entities, admittedly, but they would at least be less opaque than the legal fiction that is ""the crown"". As Geoffrey Robertson QC explains it, the crown is merely ""an artefact"". To replace it with the people and their parliament is a simple manoeuvre.  The more fundamental matter is the crown as a constitutional, rather than legal, entity: what would we do with the prerogative?  This is actually two questions rolled into one. First, there are the residual royal powers, which can be exercised by the monarch herself: to appoint a prime minister and refuse a request for a dissolution of parliament. These look merely theoretical, until one imagines Britain caught in a Florida-style electoral deadlock. In the event of a hung parliament, who under our current system would choose whether to give the nod to Tony Blair or William Hague? Answer: the Queen.  The fate for these two royal prerogatives is fairly straightforward. We could simply keep them in the hands of the newly democratic head of state - however that person was chosen (of which more later). Or we could make at least one of those powers redundant. The right to refuse a dissolution exists only because our parliamentary terms are currently not fixed. With set terms, of four or five years, there would be no question of early elections. Polling day would be known years in advance - with no need to give the power over dissolution to anyone. Such a reform would have the added benefit of bringing fairness to our electoral contests: at present, the prime minister's right to name polling day is tantamount to a running race in which one of the contestants gets to fire the starting gun.    <B> Crown prerogative</B><BR>  More complex is the crown prerogative itself. As David McKie writes on page 19, that notion is used to exercise all kinds of executive power - from making war to dispensing largesse and patronage. What would we do with these powers, currently exercised not by the Queen but by the prime minister?  The answer is abolition. The flaw of the last constitutional settlement - in the 17th century - was that it did not abolish the absolute powers of the monarch, but merely tied them up in purple string and handed them, in effect, to the prime minister. The absolute powers themselves remained; only the person wielding them changed. So the solution now would not be to keep crown prerogative in the hands of the PM, with only a change of name. On the contrary, the reformers' case is that the prerogative itself should be taken apart.  What that would mean in practice is diffusion. Some of today's crown powers would stay in the hands of the executive but others would be spread about. The power to make war and sign treaties might go to the UK parliament in Westminster. The power of patronage, to fill the benches of the second chamber, could move to the electorate, via direct election of new members. The vast battery of powers that makes our executive the mightiest in the western world could all be spread elsewhere: more   to the parliaments in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, more to mayors in London and to any other big city that wants them. The crown prerogative would simply be dismantled - its goodies spread around the country, no longer hoarded at the centre. The result would be a change in the very way Britain is governed. No longer the old monarchical model, in which power flows from the top down - but a more democratic shape, in which power is diffuse and flows from the bottom up.  So much for the royal and crown prerogatives. With those powers either aboliished or transferred, what's left in the space marked head of state? Is there even a job left to fill?  The palace doubt it. They believe that the vague, mysterious association of Crown and Queen is essential to her role as head of state. They insist that no head of state could ever function separate from the ancient edifice of prerogative. In other words, Britain could not conceivably have a head of state other than a monarch.  But look closer. Here is how palace officials privately define the job. To them, a head of state must act as the focus of the nation, leading the nation in mourning or celebration - serving as the public expression of collective emotions. Cattily, some might doubt the royals' track record in this particular field. More seriously, they might wonder if this is a task only those of royal blood could perform.  Second, say the Windsor circle, a head of state should recognise public achievement: visiting hospitals, handing out awards. True but, once again, is this a role that could only be performed by a single, genetically ordained family? Third, a national figurehead should contribute to the collective welfare - leading voluntary work or promoting charity. There's no doubt today's royals do that - but so do elected heads of state the world over.  In fact, it is only the last aspect of the palace's job description that touches on a role perhaps the royals alone can perform: to act as a rock of continuity, an anchor during periods of intense change. It's true that royalty can claim a lineage and a past that others cannot. But even that is a mixed blessing: for the rock symbolises not just stability but paralysis, a society whose hierarchies and aristocracy remain in place for centuries - permanently excluding everyone else from ever reaching the nation's symbolic pinnacle.    <B> The people's choice</B><BR>  So, despite the palace's insistence to the contrary, a head of state does not always have to be chosen by birth. They can be chosen by people. How might Britain do it? Most republicans agree the question will not realistically, and probably ought not, arise until the present Queen dies. She has won wide admiration after a half-century of service and will doubtless close out her reign the same way. But what then? There are countless options. Perhaps the simplest would be to combine the role of head of state with that of head of government, so that when the nation chooses a prime minister at election time it would also pick the person to host foreign dignitaries and state banquets. That would be simple, but perhaps unsatisfactory - for we would lose out on the extra role of constitutional longstop a head of state can play.  We could opt for direct election, just like the Irish. Enter the critics threatening the nightmare of Presidents Hattersley or Thatcher - though if that truly is a nightmare, the electorate is hardly likely to vote for it. Besides, one could easily write the rules to prevent any past politician seeking the job. When one looks at the success of Mary Robinson or Mary McAleese in Dublin, direct election looks quite appealing.  For those who suspect a directly-elected president with a national mandate would be too strong a rival for the rest of our politicians - chiefly the prime minister - to tolerate, then indirect election is the obvious alternative. At present MPs, who we vote for, choose the Speaker - and that person could easily double as head of state, even taking on the weighty task of picking which leader should form a government from a hung parliament. Some would say that would give the Speaker too much power, especially if Britain were to adopt proportional representation. But that power already exists -resting in the hands of a hereditary monarch nobody chooses and nobody can remove.  There are plenty of variations: including activist Anthony Barnett's notion that a ""royal family"" should be chosen by random lot, like jury service, once every three years. Reformers argue that Britons can do it however they like - just so long as, for the first time ever, they choose their own head of state.  The benefits, they say, will be subtle, but real. For Britons will do more than choose the person who ""interprets the nation to itself"". By asserting themselves, rather than the crown, as the governing force in British life, they will become the owners of their own country - insisting that it is their land, not the crown's, that it is their government, not Her Majesty's, and that nothing is beyond their reach. Britons will be owners, not tenants, of their country; citizens, not subjects.

<BR><B>Talk about it</B><BR>  <B>Interactive</B><BR>  <BR>    <B>Useful links</B><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>","Sometimes an apology is easier to give than to receive. We all know it from our own lives. The one who says sorry can sit back, happy that the moral high ground is theirs, that they have done their bit. But the person who has been handed the apology, what can they do? They may not be ready to accept it; they may still feel too bitter to forgive. Yet if they reject it, they will be damned as obstinate and mean-spirited. As it is around the kitchen table, writ small, so it is in Northern Ireland this week, writ large and tragic. On Tuesday the IRA offered its ""sincere apologies and condolences"" to the families of those ""non-combatants"" it killed or injured during the 30 years of the Troubles. In a statement cast more in the language of psychotherapy than armed struggle, the IRA declared an end to ""denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt"". In nine short paragraphs, the IRA used the word hurt three times, pain and grief twice each. And, in a break from past form, it blamed the British government not once.  Still, like so many apologies, this one will not be enough to heal the divided Northern Irish family. You could tell that straightaway. Some unionists followed the lead of Tom Donnelly, whose sister was killed on Bloody Friday - the 1972 IRA atrocity the imminent anniversary of which prompted the latest statement. He confessed himself overwhelmed by the apology, which he said gave him great hope.  But others, perhaps most, were cynical. They dismiss the IRA's words as yet another ploy by the republican movement to further its own political ends.   Specifically, they note a looming deadline: next Wednesday the British government has to declare whether or not the IRA is sticking to its ceasefire. If the answer is no, then Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble - who set the deadline - will demand Sinn Fein be ejected from Northern Ireland's self-ruling executive. To sceptical unionist eyes this week's apology was ""pure PR"", an IRA attempt to get into Tony Blair's good books before judgment day.  Which says something about the mood on the unionist street. Support for the Good Friday agreement remains strong among the business community and the well-heeled. But among the rank and file, says one senior UUP official, deep disenchantment has set in. Plenty of unionists regarded the 1998 deal as a ""moral outrage"" from the beginning - they were only prepared to hold their tongue in the hope that republicans were serious about ""getting out of the violence business"".  But the past 12 months have eroded what little faith there was in republicanism's peaceful intentions, say unionists. Last August's arrest of three republican operatives in Colombia, later charged with collaboration with the FARC narco-terrorist movement, blew the first major hole in unionist confidence. The March break-in at the Castlereagh security building - when ultra-sensitive security files were stolen - and ongoing street violence in Belfast have done the rest of the damage.  Now, say unionists, disillusion is so deep that if elections for the Northern Ireland assembly - due next May - were held tomorrow, Ian Paisley's anti-agreement Democratic Unionists would sweep Trimble's party to oblivion. Blair, they say, has to reassure unionists fast.   One move they would like to see next week, and which they insist is possible, is an American return to the peace process, in the form of a US team flown in to judge ceasefire compliance. Any envoy appointed by George ""war on terror"" Bush would be trusted by unionists and, they say, would buy Trimble valuable time.  That's not how republicans see it. They dismiss the US notion as fanciful for the same, strict reason they apply to all new initiatives: such a mechanism is not mentioned in the Good Friday agreement, which republicans refer to with jesuitical rigour. The same goes for current talk of a possible plea by Blair next week for a ""widening"" of the IRA ceasefire: if it's not in the agreement, it's not going to happen.  Besides, they believe that Tony Blair will not hand down the damning verdict on the IRA that Trimble is looking for: it won't be a clean bill of health from the PM, but enough to keep Sinn Fein in government. Was the apology designed to nudge that along? Few would doubt it. The timing, at least, smacks of the choreographed sequence between the IRA, London and Dublin that has become so familiar.  But don't miss the big picture, say republicans. This apology was ""a big deal"" - a hard move to make for a self-styled national liberation movement, which believes its cause was always just. It was not that long ago that Sinn Fein leaders could barely express regret about bombings and killings. Now the IRA itself, in its own words, apologises for the grief, pain and hurt it has inflicted.  So which side is right: the unionists who dismiss this week's statement as a   self-serving trick or republicans who want respect for having acted honourably? Maybe a useful way to answer the question is with a thought experiment. The year is 2031, and it is early September. Suddenly the TV news hums with word of a statement from the ruling council of al-Qaida. It speaks of regret for the suffering it inflicted 30 years earlier, on September 11.  Would those words heal the families of those lost in New York and Washington? Probably not. But would it say something about al-Qaida's intent to kill again, especially if that organisation had been on a ceasefire for the previous six to eight years? Wouldn't the whole world feel relieved if al-Qaida ever said such a thing?  So maybe it would have been better if the IRA apology had extended to everyone, including the ""combatants"" of the RUC and army, still regarded as heroes by unionists. And maybe the IRA move was prompted by opportunism - but what Machiavellian purpose were republicans trying to pursue, exactly? Only to stay in government, as is their right under the agreement. Like it or not, all these alleged ""ploys"", whether the decommissioning of arms or this week's apology, have been to one end: to keep the peace process afloat, now that republicans have decided that the process is in its own strategic interest.  Republicanism is on a journey, slow and incomplete, away from its paramilitary past to a political future. It is not neat or perfect, but it looks more real with each passing month.

Variations of that question have proved lethal for reformers. In Britain the republican cause has been held back for years by two words: President Thatcher. Or, put another way, President Hattersley. Tune in to any of the now regular phone-ins and TV debates on the monarchy and you'll soon hear a defender of the status quo winning over his audience by conjuring up a dread prospect of the future.  In Australia that trap proved fatal for the republican movement. Polls showed that more than 70% of Australians wanted to elect their own head of state. Yet the 1999 referendum proposing to remove the Queen as Oz's national figurehead failed because voters did not like the replacement on offer, a ""politicians' president"" chosen by the Canberra parliament.  That result left British reformers with a challenge, forcing them to realise that it was not enough simply to rail against the present order: they would have to explain how any future change would work.  The first move, as made clear both by David McKie and in today's editorial, is to address the crown prerogative. Many lawyers, scholars and activists now agree that ""the crown"" underpins and explains many if not most of the excesses and distortions of our current governmental set-up. But what would reform of such a nebulous, shadowy concept entail? What would abolition of the crown mean?  At first glance, such a drastic move might seem just too vast - like whipping out the ground from underneath our feet. Everything would have to change - from our land law, which technically makes every freeholder the mere owner of an interest in the land of the monarch, to our courts, which currently present every case as The Crown or Regina vs. Joe Bloggs.  In fact, it would not be that complicated. Legally, the notional entity of the crown could simply be replaced by ""the state"" or, where it's more honest, ""the government"" or even, perhaps in criminal court cases, by ""the people."" Each one of these would be abstract entities, admittedly, but they would at least be less opaque than the legal fiction that is ""the crown"". As Geoffrey Robertson QC explains it, the crown is merely ""an artefact"". To replace it with the people and their parliament is a simple manoeuvre.  The more fundamental matter is the crown as a constitutional, rather than legal, entity: what would we do with the prerogative?  This is actually two questions rolled into one. First, there are the residual royal powers, which can be exercised by the monarch herself: to appoint a prime minister and refuse a request for a dissolution of parliament. These look merely theoretical, until one imagines Britain caught in a Florida-style electoral deadlock. In the event of a hung parliament, who under our current system would choose whether to give the nod to Tony Blair or William Hague? Answer: the Queen.  The fate for these two royal prerogatives is fairly straightforward. We could simply keep them in the hands of the newly democratic head of state - however that person was chosen (of which more later). Or we could make at least one of those powers redundant. The right to refuse a dissolution exists only because our parliamentary terms are currently not fixed. With set terms, of four or five years, there would be no question of early elections. Polling day would be known years in advance - with no need to give the power over dissolution to anyone. Such a reform would have the added benefit of bringing fairness to our electoral contests: at present, the prime minister's right to name polling day is tantamount to a running race in which one of the contestants gets to fire the starting gun.    <B> Crown prerogative</B><BR>  More complex is the crown prerogative itself. As David McKie writes on page 19, that notion is used to exercise all kinds of executive power - from making war to dispensing largesse and patronage. What would we do with these powers, currently exercised not by the Queen but by the prime minister?  The answer is abolition. The flaw of the last constitutional settlement - in the 17th century - was that it did not abolish the absolute powers of the monarch, but merely tied them up in purple string and handed them, in effect, to the prime minister. The absolute powers themselves remained; only the person wielding them changed. So the solution now would not be to keep crown prerogative in the hands of the PM, with only a change of name. On the contrary, the reformers' case is that the prerogative itself should be taken apart.  What that would mean in practice is diffusion. Some of today's crown powers would stay in the hands of the executive but others would be spread about. The power to make war and sign treaties might go to the UK parliament in Westminster. The power of patronage, to fill the benches of the second chamber, could move to the electorate, via direct election of new members. The vast battery of powers that makes our executive the mightiest in the western world could all be spread elsewhere: more   to the parliaments in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, more to mayors in London and to any other big city that wants them. The crown prerogative would simply be dismantled - its goodies spread around the country, no longer hoarded at the centre. The result would be a change in the very way Britain is governed. No longer the old monarchical model, in which power flows from the top down - but a more democratic shape, in which power is diffuse and flows from the bottom up.  So much for the royal and crown prerogatives. With those powers either aboliished or transferred, what's left in the space marked head of state? Is there even a job left to fill?  The palace doubt it. They believe that the vague, mysterious association of Crown and Queen is essential to her role as head of state. They insist that no head of state could ever function separate from the ancient edifice of prerogative. In other words, Britain could not conceivably have a head of state other than a monarch.  But look closer. Here is how palace officials privately define the job. To them, a head of state must act as the focus of the nation, leading the nation in mourning or celebration - serving as the public expression of collective emotions. Cattily, some might doubt the royals' track record in this particular field. More seriously, they might wonder if this is a task only those of royal blood could perform.  Second, say the Windsor circle, a head of state should recognise public achievement: visiting hospitals, handing out awards. True but, once again, is this a role that could only be performed by a single, genetically ordained family? Third, a national figurehead should contribute to the collective welfare - leading voluntary work or promoting charity. There's no doubt today's royals do that - but so do elected heads of state the world over.  In fact, it is only the last aspect of the palace's job description that touches on a role perhaps the royals alone can perform: to act as a rock of continuity, an anchor during periods of intense change. It's true that royalty can claim a lineage and a past that others cannot. But even that is a mixed blessing: for the rock symbolises not just stability but paralysis, a society whose hierarchies and aristocracy remain in place for centuries - permanently excluding everyone else from ever reaching the nation's symbolic pinnacle.    <B> The people's choice</B><BR>  So, despite the palace's insistence to the contrary, a head of state does not always have to be chosen by birth. They can be chosen by people. How might Britain do it? Most republicans agree the question will not realistically, and probably ought not, arise until the present Queen dies. She has won wide admiration after a half-century of service and will doubtless close out her reign the same way. But what then? There are countless options. Perhaps the simplest would be to combine the role of head of state with that of head of government, so that when the nation chooses a prime minister at election time it would also pick the person to host foreign dignitaries and state banquets. That would be simple, but perhaps unsatisfactory - for we would lose out on the extra role of constitutional longstop a head of state can play.  We could opt for direct election, just like the Irish. Enter the critics threatening the nightmare of Presidents Hattersley or Thatcher - though if that truly is a nightmare, the electorate is hardly likely to vote for it. Besides, one could easily write the rules to prevent any past politician seeking the job. When one looks at the success of Mary Robinson or Mary McAleese in Dublin, direct election looks quite appealing.  For those who suspect a directly-elected president with a national mandate would be too strong a rival for the rest of our politicians - chiefly the prime minister - to tolerate, then indirect election is the obvious alternative. At present MPs, who we vote for, choose the Speaker - and that person could easily double as head of state, even taking on the weighty task of picking which leader should form a government from a hung parliament. Some would say that would give the Speaker too much power, especially if Britain were to adopt proportional representation. But that power already exists -resting in the hands of a hereditary monarch nobody chooses and nobody can remove.  There are plenty of variations: including activist Anthony Barnett's notion that a ""royal family"" should be chosen by random lot, like jury service, once every three years. Reformers argue that Britons can do it however they like - just so long as, for the first time ever, they choose their own head of state.  The benefits, they say, will be subtle, but real. For Britons will do more than choose the person who ""interprets the nation to itself"". By asserting themselves, rather than the crown, as the governing force in British life, they will become the owners of their own country - insisting that it is their land, not the crown's, that it is their government, not Her Majesty's, and that nothing is beyond their reach. Britons will be owners, not tenants, of their country; citizens, not subjects.

The hunt for the London suicide bombers, the Scotland Yard commissioner says, is the biggest challenge that the Metropolitan police have ever faced.I'm sorry, Sir Ian, but that's just not true. Bigger than Chartism? Bigger than the Fenians? Bigger than the unemployed demonstrations in the 1880s? Bigger than the Mosleyites in the 1930s? Bigger than the Blitz? Bigger than the urban riots of the 1980s? With respect, I think not.For large parts of the Met's history - perhaps indeed for most of it - Londoners and their police have not lived easily together. The police were imposed on London in the riotous 1820s, and the imposition defined the relationship for decades to come - until well into my lifetime. Policing with consent may be the buzz phrase today but it was not always so. For most of its history the Met tried to recruit from outside London - from the army and from Scotland in particular - in order to maintain a distance from, not a closeness to, the London community. The mythology summed up in the old Dixon of Dock Green image of the 1950s was very largely just that, mythology.That's not to say that there was no truth in the image of the local, avuncular bobby. But it was never the whole story. In Cold Bath Fields in 1833, just around the corner from where the Guardian's offices now stand, police attacked a political reform meeting without provocation and an officer, Constable Culley, was killed by the crowd. Local people made their views clear when a coroner's jury brought in the astonishing verdict of ""justifiable homicide"". Not much community policing there.And so it continued. Half a century later, when police trampled a bystander to death in the original Bloody Sunday riots of 1887, the funeral generated one of the largest and angriest crowds of the 19th century. As the coffin of Alfred Linnell - decorated with the words Killed in Trafalgar Square - was carried to Bow cemetery, the police were greeted with repeated chants of: ""That's your work!"" Shades of Blair Peach a century later.What the Metropolitan police need, Margaret Thatcher once said in that peremptory way of hers, is ""support not criticism"". Yet this was never a universal view. Most people accepted the police, then as now. But support had to be won, and too often it was not. Not for nothing did one young Londoner, Alfred Hitchcock, sum up his views of the police in ways many shared. ""I'm not against the police,"" the great film-maker once declared. ""I'm just afraid of them.""It is hardly surprising that those kinds of views are being expressed yet again this week, after the Met shot Jean Charles de Menezes dead on a tube train last Friday. In the aftermath of this month's bombings there may be as many as 3,000 armed police on the capital's streets, a number that far exceeds either the Met's specialist armed response units or the armed police who guard key public figures and important buildings. In current circumstances that's an awful lot of people in our midst who are all a hair's breadth away from firing at a suspect. With the revelation of the ""shoot to kill to protect"" policy, suspicions must be expected and questions answered. Like Hitchcock, reasonable people may be afraid. The Commons home affairs committee ought to sit immediately.Shootings by the police still remain incredibly rare in this country. In most places, years can go by between one police bullet being fired and the next. But the key question is when it is legitimate. From what has been reported, the officer who killed the young Brazilian last week appeared to act in line with the rules issued under Lord Stevens. In extreme circumstances, he said, an armed officer can shoot a suspect in the head if the intelligence suggests that he is a suicide bomber who poses an imminent danger to the public or the police.At first sight this could be depicted as a radical extension of police guidelines. But is it? A closer examination reveals that it is more a particularisation of appropriate rules that have governed firearm use by police and the military in Britain, especially Northern Ireland, over many years. These rules contain a number of basic principles: that any force used should be the minimum necessary, that force should be used against particular targets rather than indiscriminately, that no more rounds should be fired than is necessary, that an audible warning must be given and that the officer should be certain that the suspect is about to take offensive action.What is important, though, is that the guidelines do not have the full force of the law unless and until they are tested in court. Now, tragically, we have such a case and the issues must be put to the test. Part of one's heart sinks. Matters of this kind have been a legal battleground in Northern Ireland for decades, not least in the Saville inquiry, mainly because of republicans' determination to depict themselves as the victims of British state violence but also because there are real issues of liberty and law at stake. Even Northern Ireland's often-maligned courts have found, for instance, that the mere failure of a suspect to halt when challenged does not justify shooting him.We need to be prepared to make a similar distinction in the De Menezes case. Just because some mischief makers are already trying to imply that the Met has a shoot-to-kill policy against young, dark-skinned men - which it doesn't - this does not absolve either the Met in general or the officers involved from having to answer for their decisions before a proper tribunal. An innocent man has been killed in the effort to protect other innocent people. That action must be judged. That would happen in Iraq and Israel - and in the British army. It should happen here too.The police should not panic about this. Over the past 25 years, largely since the Scarman report, there has been more reform of London's police than in the preceding century and a half. A police force has become a police service. The quality of leadership has been transformed - compare Ian Blair with David McNee - as have the quality and diversity of its officers. Much remains undone. There are too many boys with toys. Politicians still veer away from constructive criticism of the police.But this should not blind us to what has changed. The relationship between the police and Londoners is unrecognisable from what it was. In the McNee era there would have been no apologies and the force would have drawn tightly together, maligning the critics rather than facing up to the criticism. In the Blair era that is not necessary. Dreadful errors will still happen, from which lessons must be learned. The police are not magicians. But the public has learned to trust the police, errors and all, and I think they are right to do so."
1,"Tears, especially male ones, are becoming a frequent sight on British television. In the past week alone, several of the ambitious, thrusting men competing to be Alan Sugar's apprentice on BBC2 cracked under the stress and started welling up. Meanwhile, minor celebrities, worn down by the strain of singing pop duets for Just the Two of Us, similarly shooed away the camera, lest it discover them weeping.Yet the men on another BBC programme remained steadfastly free of tears. In Facing the Truth, victims and perpetrators of violence in Northern Ireland met each other under the gentle gaze of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. They told and heard stories to break the heart, and sometimes their eyes grew moist, but these men did not cry.These remarkable films, shown over three successive nights, prompted a whole range of thoughts. First, they were a reminder of the sheer strangeness of the Troubles. Citizens of this country recalled their campaigns to kill each other; how they saw themselves and their targets as ""soldiers"", how they studied files, drawn up by self-styled ""intelligence officers"", telling them how to track down and murder their quarry. How they did this while pretending to live ordinary lives. Michael Stone, notorious for his 1988 killing spree at Milltown cemetery, used to rub dirt and sand into his clothes so that his wife would think he was a builder. One of his targets drove a Mother's Pride delivery van. Few described it this way at the time, but these programmes left little doubt: on the streets of the United Kingdom, there was a civil war.Facing the Truth prompted a question: why has Northern Ireland not had its own truth and reconciliation commission, analogous to the one Archbishop Tutu chaired in South Africa? Why had it been left to television, to the BBC, to organise one? Watching, it became clear the province needs such a process: there is no shortage of pain or people yearning to bear witness.But the programmes asked a larger question. For what was noticeable in several of the filmed encounters was a subtle, unstated pressure - not on the culprits to show contrition, but on the victims. Those who had lost limbs or loved ones were under pressure - to forgive.Carefully and sensitively, the grieving relatives were led to a climax: how would they close the meeting? Would they be able to reach out and shake the hand of those who had wrought such havoc? There was something uncomfortable about this, for it is part of a larger pressure, not confined to this TV series, which demands that those who have suffered most must also be the most generous.Which is why I feel for the Rev Julie Nicholson, the vicar who has quit her Bristol pulpit because she can no longer preach forgiveness - not after her daughter, Jenny, was killed in the July 7 bombings last year. As a Christian, Nicholson clearly felt under enormous pressure to say she could forgive Mohammed Sidique Khan, who had blown up himself and six others at Edgware Road station. But she could not do it.And now I wonder why we ask such a thing of those who have been bereaved so cruelly. Of course, there are people who are able, somehow, to meet this challenge. The mother of Anthony Walker, the Liverpool teenager murdered by racist thugs wielding an ice axe, somehow emerged from the trial of her son's killers to declare: ""I have got to forgive them. I still forgive them."" Last year the mother of Abigail Witchells, stabbed in front of her toddler child, spoke of her ""enormous sadness"" on hearing of the suicide of her daughter's presumed attacker. She said his death was the ""real tragedy of the story"" - and that she had forgiven him.I confess to being both in awe of and baffled by the compassion of such people. Of course, none of us can know how we would respond to so desperate a plight, but I struggle to understand how you could forgive the killer, or attempted killer, of your own child. I do not know how it would be possible to hold anything in your heart but rage and pain.There are philosophical objections one could muster too. Surely the only person who can forgive a crime is its direct victim: Anthony Walker has the authority to forgive his killers - but he is not here. For believers, I have sympathy with those who say that if forgiveness is in the hands of anybody it is, like judgment, in the hands of God alone.But these are not the prevailing or even popular assumptions. Instead, we exalt those who can forgive and regard those who cannot as guilty of a kind of moral weakness. We demand that those who have been brought low reach highest.There might be a way through this - and it would begin with an attempt to define our terms. Forgiveness has entered casual parlance as a psychological term, shorthand for ""moving on"", for no longer holding a grudge, even for feelings of equanimity or empathy towards the person who hurt you.""If it is that, it can't be done,"" says Giles Fraser, vicar of Putney and author of Christianity and Violence. He dismisses the idea of ""loving"" the man who has harmed you or your family as ""morally perverse, even if I understood what it meant. How could feelings of anger and loss coexist with that love?"" That definition of forgiveness, the one we seem to demand from those who have suffered most, is little more than ""cheap Christian rhetoric"".No, forgiveness should be a much more realistic, pragmatic business. In Fraser's eyes, to forgive someone is merely to vow that you will not respond to their crime in kind. If they have killed, you will not kill back: you will choose instead to end the cycle of violence. On this definition, forgiveness is the literal opposite of revenge.This is a move that is much easier to imagine. Sylvia Hackett, whose husband Dermot was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, has clearly moved beyond wanting to do to Michael Stone what he and his comrades did to her. But on Monday night's programme she seemed to feel that was not enough; she forced herself to walk over to Stone and shake his hand. When he placed a second hand on hers, she recoiled and fled from the room. It was too much. She may not have wanted to kill Stone, but nor did she want to be his friend. Yet our present day notions of forgiveness confuse the two.Not that the eschewing of revenge should be considered something small: it is not forgiveness lite. In most circumstances, we can give up our right to seek direct vengeance in favour of justice: we may not kill the killers, but at least we will see them behind bars. But in some places - Northern Ireland and South Africa among them - there is not even that comfort. Justice has been sacrificed in the pursuit of peace. That is why Michael Stone, originally sentenced to 684 years in jail, is now a free man, released under the Good Friday agreement.So we should alter what we mean by forgiveness. It is not a syrupy inscription in a greetings card; it is a painful, practical step taken by those who want to end the killing. It is not some impossible ideal: it is, properly defined, achievable - and no less admirable for that.","It is the question republicans have learned to fear.

That would be simple, but perhaps unsatisfactory - for we would lose out on the extra role of constitutional longstop a head of state can play.  We could opt for direct election, just like the Irish. Enter the critics threatening the nightmare of Presidents Hattersley or Thatcher - though if that truly is a nightmare, the electorate is hardly likely to vote for it. Besides, one could easily write the rules to prevent any past politician seeking the job. When one looks at the success of Mary Robinson or Mary McAleese in Dublin, direct election looks quite appealing.  For those who suspect a directly-elected president with a national mandate would be too strong a rival for the rest of our politicians - chiefly the prime minister - to tolerate, then indirect election is the obvious alternative. At present MPs, who we vote for, choose the Speaker - and that person could easily double as head of state, even taking on the weighty task of picking which leader should form a government from a hung parliament. Some would say that would give the Speaker too much power, especially if Britain were to adopt proportional representation. But that power already exists -resting in the hands of a hereditary monarch nobody chooses and nobody can remove.  There are plenty of variations: including activist Anthony Barnett's notion that a ""royal family"" should be chosen by random lot, like jury service, once every three years. Reformers argue that Britons can do it however they like - just so long as, for the first time ever, they choose their own head of state.  The benefits, they say, will be subtle, but real. For Britons will do more than choose the person who ""interprets the nation to itself"". By asserting themselves, rather than the crown, as the governing force in British life, they will become the owners of their own country - insisting that it is their land, not the crown's, that it is their government, not Her Majesty's, and that nothing is beyond their reach. Britons will be owners, not tenants, of their country; citizens, not subjects. We will at last be able to declare that there is only one sovereign in our land - and it is ourselves. <B>20 things only a monarch can do</B><B> 1</B>Own all unmarked mute swans on open water. <B> 2</B> Hold up other traffic on the railways while the royal train passes.  <B> 3</B> Get the full and unabridged minutes of all Cabinet minutes - unlike Cabinet ministers who must make do with a summary.    <B> 4</B> Receive reports of all Royal commissions ahead of those who commissioned them, on vellum.   <B> 5</B> Declare holidays: an extra bank holiday in 2002 to mark the golden jubilee four- day celebration weekend.   <B> 6</B> Appoint all magistrates in Liverpool, Manchester and Lancashire.

0,"Tears, especially male ones, are becoming a frequent sight on British television. In the past week alone, several of the ambitious, thrusting men competing to be Alan Sugar's apprentice on BBC2 cracked under the stress and started welling up. Meanwhile, minor celebrities, worn down by the strain of singing pop duets for Just the Two of Us, similarly shooed away the camera, lest it discover them weeping.Yet the men on another BBC programme remained steadfastly free of tears. In Facing the Truth, victims and perpetrators of violence in Northern Ireland met each other under the gentle gaze of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. They told and heard stories to break the heart, and sometimes their eyes grew moist, but these men did not cry.These remarkable films, shown over three successive nights, prompted a whole range of thoughts. First, they were a reminder of the sheer strangeness of the Troubles. Citizens of this country recalled their campaigns to kill each other; how they saw themselves and their targets as ""soldiers"", how they studied files, drawn up by self-styled ""intelligence officers"", telling them how to track down and murder their quarry. How they did this while pretending to live ordinary lives. Michael Stone, notorious for his 1988 killing spree at Milltown cemetery, used to rub dirt and sand into his clothes so that his wife would think he was a builder. One of his targets drove a Mother's Pride delivery van. Few described it this way at the time, but these programmes left little doubt: on the streets of the United Kingdom, there was a civil war.Facing the Truth prompted a question: why has Northern Ireland not had its own truth and reconciliation commission, analogous to the one Archbishop Tutu chaired in South Africa? Why had it been left to television, to the BBC, to organise one? Watching, it became clear the province needs such a process: there is no shortage of pain or people yearning to bear witness.But the programmes asked a larger question. For what was noticeable in several of the filmed encounters was a subtle, unstated pressure - not on the culprits to show contrition, but on the victims. Those who had lost limbs or loved ones were under pressure - to forgive.Carefully and sensitively, the grieving relatives were led to a climax: how would they close the meeting? Would they be able to reach out and shake the hand of those who had wrought such havoc? There was something uncomfortable about this, for it is part of a larger pressure, not confined to this TV series, which demands that those who have suffered most must also be the most generous.Which is why I feel for the Rev Julie Nicholson, the vicar who has quit her Bristol pulpit because she can no longer preach forgiveness - not after her daughter, Jenny, was killed in the July 7 bombings last year. As a Christian, Nicholson clearly felt under enormous pressure to say she could forgive Mohammed Sidique Khan, who had blown up himself and six others at Edgware Road station. But she could not do it.And now I wonder why we ask such a thing of those who have been bereaved so cruelly. Of course, there are people who are able, somehow, to meet this challenge. The mother of Anthony Walker, the Liverpool teenager murdered by racist thugs wielding an ice axe, somehow emerged from the trial of her son's killers to declare: ""I have got to forgive them. I still forgive them."" Last year the mother of Abigail Witchells, stabbed in front of her toddler child, spoke of her ""enormous sadness"" on hearing of the suicide of her daughter's presumed attacker. She said his death was the ""real tragedy of the story"" - and that she had forgiven him.I confess to being both in awe of and baffled by the compassion of such people. Of course, none of us can know how we would respond to so desperate a plight, but I struggle to understand how you could forgive the killer, or attempted killer, of your own child. I do not know how it would be possible to hold anything in your heart but rage and pain.There are philosophical objections one could muster too. Surely the only person who can forgive a crime is its direct victim: Anthony Walker has the authority to forgive his killers - but he is not here. For believers, I have sympathy with those who say that if forgiveness is in the hands of anybody it is, like judgment, in the hands of God alone.But these are not the prevailing or even popular assumptions. Instead, we exalt those who can forgive and regard those who cannot as guilty of a kind of moral weakness. We demand that those who have been brought low reach highest.There might be a way through this - and it would begin with an attempt to define our terms. Forgiveness has entered casual parlance as a psychological term, shorthand for ""moving on"", for no longer holding a grudge, even for feelings of equanimity or empathy towards the person who hurt you.""If it is that, it can't be done,"" says Giles Fraser, vicar of Putney and author of Christianity and Violence. He dismisses the idea of ""loving"" the man who has harmed you or your family as ""morally perverse, even if I understood what it meant. How could feelings of anger and loss coexist with that love?"" That definition of forgiveness, the one we seem to demand from those who have suffered most, is little more than ""cheap Christian rhetoric"".No, forgiveness should be a much more realistic, pragmatic business. In Fraser's eyes, to forgive someone is merely to vow that you will not respond to their crime in kind. If they have killed, you will not kill back: you will choose instead to end the cycle of violence. On this definition, forgiveness is the literal opposite of revenge.This is a move that is much easier to imagine. Sylvia Hackett, whose husband Dermot was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, has clearly moved beyond wanting to do to Michael Stone what he and his comrades did to her. But on Monday night's programme she seemed to feel that was not enough; she forced herself to walk over to Stone and shake his hand. When he placed a second hand on hers, she recoiled and fled from the room. It was too much. She may not have wanted to kill Stone, but nor did she want to be his friend. Yet our present day notions of forgiveness confuse the two.Not that the eschewing of revenge should be considered something small: it is not forgiveness lite. In most circumstances, we can give up our right to seek direct vengeance in favour of justice: we may not kill the killers, but at least we will see them behind bars. But in some places - Northern Ireland and South Africa among them - there is not even that comfort. Justice has been sacrificed in the pursuit of peace. That is why Michael Stone, originally sentenced to 684 years in jail, is now a free man, released under the Good Friday agreement.So we should alter what we mean by forgiveness. It is not a syrupy inscription in a greetings card; it is a painful, practical step taken by those who want to end the killing. It is not some impossible ideal: it is, properly defined, achievable - and no less admirable for that.","Who started this ""them and us"" between town and country? The mis-named Countryside Alliance when they marched on London last year and later brayed outside the Labour party conference in Bournemouth.Yesterday the prime minister went to Devon and blew their cover. They are not ""the countryside"". They are a bunch of Tory hunters and farmers who no more represent most country dwellers than red-braced commodity brokers in City champagne bars represent townies.Blair has the facts on his side and he delivered a barrage of them yesterday: the countryside is doing pretty well. There is a farming crisis, there is real rural poverty (though proportionately less) but life for most people in the country is better than in towns. They are healthier, happier, safer, better educated and richer. Not surprisingly townies tell pollsters they wish they lived there too. The traditional left likes to stress the two nations of the north/south divide while the right tries to capitalise on a rural/urban split, both playing to their own electoral heartlands. William Hague was stoking up that old anti-townie sentiment in his speech to the NFU this week: ""The rural way of life is under threat from urban values, Islington pressure groups and a metropolitan elite who know nothing about the countryside.""Tony Blair is attempting to dismantle the banality of these national semi-myths: the north is also rich, the south also poor, town and country share most common concerns. In Devon yesterday he rightly sought to disentangle the tiny farming industry from most of rural life. Agriculture is only 1% of GDP and only employs 2% of the workforce in England. Even in rural areas it only employs 4% of the workforce. Like everyone else, most people work in services or in small businesses. There is no ""rural crisis"".  But yes, there is indeed a farming crisis and this is the worst agricultural recession since the 30s. What should be done? ""Income can go down as well as up and is not guaranteed,"" says the very small print at the bottom of all financial service ads. Most of us live with that possibility because it is part of the human condition to know that disaster can strike.But farmers seem to consider themselves outside the cut and thrust of the normal market processes they so heartily endorse when they go into the polling booths to vote Tory. In real terms farmers' incomes rose by 100% between 1990 and 1995. But now they have dropped by 60% since then.   There's every reason to feel especially sorry for the 20% who are tenant farmers with nothing to sell up, but most farmers own valuable land, the price of which has soared recently.Yet even farmers sitting on a fortune think they should be bailed out. Why? Walk into the bankruptcy court any day of the week and case after case will bring tears to your eyes at the sight of so many decent people wiped out by bad luck or bad judgment. Two out of three new business start-ups fail. Farmers are not the only hard-pressed businessmen to commit suicide. Should the state step in and bail them all out?  Images of the harsh treatment meted out to the miners colour all our current attitudes towards compensating lame-duck industries. Mrs Thatcher said we couldn't and shouldn't pay people to dig out coal no one wanted, so now it's hard to see why farmers should be paid to breed unsaleable cattle, pigs and lambs. Global markets change and in over-producing meat, farmers misjudged their markets. It happens. We can feel very sorry for them, though their political attitudes don't always make it easy. Letting the Countryside Alliance be their advocate is about as helpful to their cause as Arthur Scargill was to the miners'.  Cleverer leadership would have had the farmers' tractors rolling down Whitehall long ago to protest at the high pound which is the gravest single cause of their distress. Other industries get some benefit from cheaper imported raw materials, but for farmers who import nothing the high cost of exporting is pure calamity. The NFU has always been pro-euro, but they haven't rolled out their tanks to demand early entry.Where are the green Barbours on platforms up and down the land demanding we join and that everything is done to lower interest rates, bring down the value of the pound and make euro entry possible? (Now we have missed entry on day one, the only way to lower interest rates without inflation is to raise taxation instead. Are they for it?) Instead the NFU conference applauded William Hague's strange pleas for more EU subsidy and didn't query his admission that ""the strong pound has hit all livestock farming with unprecedented ferocity"".   The farming lobby is powerful and emotive because it taps an atavistic national fantasy that everyone's roots or their retirement destination is the countryside of Hovis dreams. It was brave of Blair to face the farmers down with some home truths: adapt or die is his hard message. Labour has handed out £435m extra in direct aid to farmers, but from now on there will only be more for those things that are socially useful. Ten million - not enough - is to subsidise the cost of converting to organic or semi-organic methods. (Absurdly we import 70% of our organic produce as we don't grow enough here: there are long waiting lists of farmers wanting to convert.)Other funds will help turn farmers into countryside   stewards: we may not need sheep to eat, but we need them as lawn mowers on barely profitable hill farms, to preserve those much loved patchwork landscapes with dry-stone walls. There are grants for developing new industrial crops to generate energy, make plastics and grow hemp for manufacturing. But all these are small funds for small schemes. In the end the market is let rip. Except, of course, for the continuing disgrace of the CAP, whose snail's pace reform still hands out a monstrous £3bn farming subsidy mainly to those who need it least: 80% goes to 20% of the farmers, many of them the richest.  The future, the government suggests, lies in tourism, to which some farmers reply arrogantly that they don't want to be park-keepers. But for some it's that or nothing: 90% of the people live in towns and they want access to the country. They are the market and farmers   had better learn to smile at them instead of blocking footpaths and setting dogs on them. They may be townie sentimentalists but they want fewer pesticides polluting the soil and more live birds. (The RSPB has more members than all the political parties put together - and they are, incidentally, outraged that Blair's one pointless sop to the farmers this week was an unexpected pledge not to introduce a proposed pesticide tax to make farmers cut down on their use.) The Countryside Alliance's opposition to the right to roam was just another example of their disastrous leadership on rural matters: if they want to survive they are going to have to learn to love ramblers, picnickers and even people from Islington. No more of this ""them and us"" romance."
1,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's been the rallying cry of the defenders of our ancient, unwritten constitution through the ages - if not always in those words. Sure, say the old guard, our patchwork quilt of unspoken custom and tacit tradition may not make logical sense when set out on a clean sheet of paper - that's one good reason why we keep it unwritten. But, insist the keepers of the flame, our non-systematic system has held up just fine for centuries. So long as it still works, there's no need to change it. The trouble is, that's no longer true. The system is not working: it is broke - and we need to fix it. For the test of any constitution is the quality of governance it produces. In just the last few years we have seen all too clearly how well our system works: from the great pension scandal of the mid-1980s to the BSE calamity of the 1990s, from the outbreak of sleaze to the sell-off of our railways, from the poll tax to the debacle of the Dome - the proof is all around us of a standard of government that is just not good enough. In each case the system did not contain the checks and balances, the basic scrutiny, that might have weeded out bad legislation and prevented disastrous mistakes.  This cannot be the exclusive fault of this administration or that individual politician. It happens too often for that. Rather, as both the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair or the Phillips report on BSE concluded, the flaw lies in the system itself - the way we are governed. And that means our constitution.  The British people woke up to this fact long ago, even if few dare say it. Polling data consistently show a decline in esteem for our institutions and the system which links them together. While 48% expressed ""quite a lot of confidence"" in the House of Commons in 1985, that figure had halved by 1995. A year later a European Union poll found that Britons had less faith in their parliament than the people of any member country bar Portugal. Local government's standing has never been weaker, with turnout in council elections dropping like a stone. Trust in our institutions is in freefall, with the young especially disenchanted. One Mori survey found 71%of first-time voters convinced their ballot would ""make little or no difference to their lives"". We are beginning to vote with our feet - by staying away from the polling station. Britain's turnout figures are in decline, with recent by-elections lucky to involve more than 30% of the vote. In one Leeds seat, the turnout fell below one in five of all registered voters. It all adds up to a growing loss of faith in our system of governance.  These trends are not wholly new: reformers have seen the need for a radical overhaul of our constitution for decades. But now there is an extra urgency. For not only is the old system not working well: it is beginning to come apart. Since 1997 Labour has undertaken a raft of constitutional changes so radical they have historians reaching for the 1830s to find a precedent. Whether it's the rolling programme of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland or the partial reform of the House of Lords, the current government has shattered forever the traditionalist belief that our system is a frail, mystical thing that belongs in a glass case and can never be touched by human hand. The conservative conviction that the constitution has remained unaltered for centuries - and therefore cannot be changed in future - is gone. The patchwork quilt can be repaired and even renewed: after all, it's unravelling already.    <B> Four nations</B><BR>  Specifically, Labour's changes have exposed to the light questions that had long been buried - and which now demand to be answered. Take devolution. Until 1997 Britain had never really come clean about its true nature as a multi-national entity: the four constituent nations each had their own cabinet department, but Britain was essentially a unitary state governed from Westminster and Whitehall. Devolution has blown that apart.  It has forced us to recognise that there are distinct countries within Britain, each with the right and ambition to govern itself - whether through a parliament in Edinburgh or assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast. The days of crypto-federalism seem to be over: thanks to devolution, Britain has acted like a country ready to come out as a federal entity.  But not completely. For Labour's decentralisation may have brought to the surface a clutch of dilemmas about Britain, but it has not resolved them. So, for example, most Britons now accept that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland deserve home rule - but what about England? Should Westminster serve as a federal legislature, dealing only with UK-wide problems - or should it double as a de facto English parliament? Why does one of the island nations, Scotland, have more autonomy than the others? Who should sit and vote in the Westminster   parliament; in the terms of the famed West Lothian question, why should Scottish MPs vote on exclusively English matters when English MPs have no say on exclusively Scottish ones?  What Labour has done is to open a can of worms: the worms were always there, we just couldn't see them before. Now the can is open we cannot look away. Perhaps the best illustration is the House of Lords. Some around Tony Blair might once have thought that expelling all but 92 of the hereditary peers would solve the problems of Britain's second chamber. Instead it's done the opposite, suddenly drawing attention to the absurd democratic deficit in parliament. When the hereditaries were there, the whole body could be written off as some Ruritanian joke. But Blair's reforms have prompted Britons to take a closer look. They now see a supposedly reformed second chamber barely more democratic than the blue-blood body it replaced - in which not a single member is elected. Leaving well alone, as the Tories used to advocate, was one thing. Now, say many Britons, if you're going to tinker with the upper house, you might as well make it democratic.    <B> Shattered mystique</B><BR>  And that's a view which is beginning to apply to our entire constitution: now that Labour has broken the taboo by daring to change it, logic demands that it be changed properly - and democratically. For the current, spatchcocked arrangement of old custom and New Labour modernisation risks being the worst of both worlds, creating a constitution that makes no sense and lacks the old (if spurious) defence of ancient continuity. The mystique has shattered at last; now our very system of government is up for grabs. Even the Conservatives are discussing radical, constitutional change: witness William Hague's flirtation with the notion of an English parliament.  There is one last factor which makes urgent our need for a new constitutional settlement. Britain may be an island, but we are not alone. The changes inside the United Kingdom have coincided with profound shifts outside it, too.  We are days away from a summit in Nice which will debate and decide the future shape of the European Union. Who should govern? A simple majority of member nations or each state by wielding its individual veto? How should the peoples of Europe be bound together? With a common currency and a shared military force - or as a loose, free trade area? How should Europe declare its values? With communiques and treaties or with a basic law? In other words, the European Union is in the midst of constitutional upheaval, too.  Beyond even Europe's boundaries, there is a similarly profound argument. The global anti-capitalist movement unleashed in Seattle and Prague asks who should rule the world - its people or the corporations and the World Trade Organisation? On the streets with the protesters or in the summit rooms of Nice, the debate turns on a single word: sovereignty. Put simply, who should be in charge? That's an issue for the world, as it grapples with the domination of Microsoft or Big Oil and gropes for a new regime of global governance. It's an issue for Europe, as it works out whether sovereignty can be pooled or only diluted. And it's an issue for Britain: who is sovereign in our land?  What it all adds up to - the weaknesses of Britain's old system, the changes made by Labour and the worldwide confusion over sovereignty - is a need: we are crying out for a new constitutional settlement. We urgently require a new dispensation that would work better than the current set-up, improve the quality of our governance and yield better outcomes and better policies that would affect all Britons' lives. A new dispensation would also complete some unfinished business left over from Labour's programme of constitutional reform, turning today's ""unsettlement"" into a settlement. For those who care about the survival of Britain that has become an urgent task: for if we do not decide a future for the union of our nations, then that union will simply unravel. Britain will break apart.  Our country needs this new settlement within our borders to work out our place in the world beyond them. Many reformers have argued that so long as we remain confused over our own sovereignty, we have little chance of sharing or pooling it with others. When the relationship between Scotland and England is still vexed, is it any wonder we cannot find the right connection between Britain and France?  We need to make a change. We need to replace an unwritten constitution which consists of one abstract idea - the crown-in-parliament - with a settlement that fits the nation we have become and the world that now exists. We cannot wear the old, moth-eaten garb of the past any longer: we have outgrown it. This is a new century and a new millennium: we need a new constitution. <B>Related stories - news</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - comment</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - background</B><BR>
<BR><BR><BR>  <BR>  <B>Talk about it</B><BR>  <B>Interactive</B><BR>  <BR>    <B>Useful links</B><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>","It is the question republicans have learned to fear. ""All right then,"" says the smiling royalist, ""let's say you go ahead and abolish the monarchy. What would you put in its place?"" Variations of that question have proved lethal for reformers. In Britain the republican cause has been held back for years by two words: President Thatcher. Or, put another way, President Hattersley. Tune in to any of the now regular phone-ins and TV debates on the monarchy and you'll soon hear a defender of the status quo winning over his audience by conjuring up a dread prospect of the future.  In Australia that trap proved fatal for the republican movement. Polls showed that more than 70% of Australians wanted to elect their own head of state. Yet the 1999 referendum proposing to remove the Queen as Oz's national figurehead failed because voters did not like the replacement on offer, a ""politicians' president"" chosen by the Canberra parliament.  That result left British reformers with a challenge, forcing them to realise that it was not enough simply to rail against the present order: they would have to explain how any future change would work.  The first move, as made clear both by David McKie and in today's editorial, is to address the crown prerogative. Many lawyers, scholars and activists now agree that ""the crown"" underpins and explains many if not most of the excesses and distortions of our current governmental set-up. But what would reform of such a nebulous, shadowy concept entail? What would abolition of the crown mean?  At first glance, such a drastic move might seem just too vast - like whipping out the ground from underneath our feet. Everything would have to change - from our land law, which technically makes every freeholder the mere owner of an interest in the land of the monarch, to our courts, which currently present every case as The Crown or Regina vs. Joe Bloggs.  In fact, it would not be that complicated. Legally, the notional entity of the crown could simply be replaced by ""the state"" or, where it's more honest, ""the government"" or even, perhaps in criminal court cases, by ""the people."" Each one of these would be abstract entities, admittedly, but they would at least be less opaque than the legal fiction that is ""the crown"". As Geoffrey Robertson QC explains it, the crown is merely ""an artefact"". To replace it with the people and their parliament is a simple manoeuvre.  The more fundamental matter is the crown as a constitutional, rather than legal, entity: what would we do with the prerogative?  This is actually two questions rolled into one. First, there are the residual royal powers, which can be exercised by the monarch herself: to appoint a prime minister and refuse a request for a dissolution of parliament. These look merely theoretical, until one imagines Britain caught in a Florida-style electoral deadlock. In the event of a hung parliament, who under our current system would choose whether to give the nod to Tony Blair or William Hague? Answer: the Queen.  The fate for these two royal prerogatives is fairly straightforward. We could simply keep them in the hands of the newly democratic head of state - however that person was chosen (of which more later). Or we could make at least one of those powers redundant. The right to refuse a dissolution exists only because our parliamentary terms are currently not fixed. With set terms, of four or five years, there would be no question of early elections. Polling day would be known years in advance - with no need to give the power over dissolution to anyone. Such a reform would have the added benefit of bringing fairness to our electoral contests: at present, the prime minister's right to name polling day is tantamount to a running race in which one of the contestants gets to fire the starting gun.    <B> Crown prerogative</B><BR>  More complex is the crown prerogative itself. As David McKie writes on page 19, that notion is used to exercise all kinds of executive power - from making war to dispensing largesse and patronage. What would we do with these powers, currently exercised not by the Queen but by the prime minister?  The answer is abolition. The flaw of the last constitutional settlement - in the 17th century - was that it did not abolish the absolute powers of the monarch, but merely tied them up in purple string and handed them, in effect, to the prime minister. The absolute powers themselves remained; only the person wielding them changed. So the solution now would not be to keep crown prerogative in the hands of the PM, with only a change of name. On the contrary, the reformers' case is that the prerogative itself should be taken apart.  What that would mean in practice is diffusion. Some of today's crown powers would stay in the hands of the executive but others would be spread about. The power to make war and sign treaties might go to the UK parliament in Westminster. The power of patronage, to fill the benches of the second chamber, could move to the electorate, via direct election of new members. The vast battery of powers that makes our executive the mightiest in the western world could all be spread elsewhere: more   to the parliaments in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, more to mayors in London and to any other big city that wants them. The crown prerogative would simply be dismantled - its goodies spread around the country, no longer hoarded at the centre. The result would be a change in the very way Britain is governed. No longer the old monarchical model, in which power flows from the top down - but a more democratic shape, in which power is diffuse and flows from the bottom up.  So much for the royal and crown prerogatives. With those powers either aboliished or transferred, what's left in the space marked head of state? Is there even a job left to fill?  The palace doubt it. They believe that the vague, mysterious association of Crown and Queen is essential to her role as head of state. They insist that no head of state could ever function separate from the ancient edifice of prerogative. In other words, Britain could not conceivably have a head of state other than a monarch.  But look closer. Here is how palace officials privately define the job. To them, a head of state must act as the focus of the nation, leading the nation in mourning or celebration - serving as the public expression of collective emotions. Cattily, some might doubt the royals' track record in this particular field. More seriously, they might wonder if this is a task only those of royal blood could perform.  Second, say the Windsor circle, a head of state should recognise public achievement: visiting hospitals, handing out awards. True but, once again, is this a role that could only be performed by a single, genetically ordained family? Third, a national figurehead should contribute to the collective welfare - leading voluntary work or promoting charity. There's no doubt today's royals do that - but so do elected heads of state the world over.  In fact, it is only the last aspect of the palace's job description that touches on a role perhaps the royals alone can perform: to act as a rock of continuity, an anchor during periods of intense change. It's true that royalty can claim a lineage and a past that others cannot. But even that is a mixed blessing: for the rock symbolises not just stability but paralysis, a society whose hierarchies and aristocracy remain in place for centuries - permanently excluding everyone else from ever reaching the nation's symbolic pinnacle.    <B> The people's choice</B><BR>  So, despite the palace's insistence to the contrary, a head of state does not always have to be chosen by birth. They can be chosen by people. How might Britain do it? Most republicans agree the question will not realistically, and probably ought not, arise until the present Queen dies. She has won wide admiration after a half-century of service and will doubtless close out her reign the same way. But what then? There are countless options. Perhaps the simplest would be to combine the role of head of state with that of head of government, so that when the nation chooses a prime minister at election time it would also pick the person to host foreign dignitaries and state banquets. That would be simple, but perhaps unsatisfactory - for we would lose out on the extra role of constitutional longstop a head of state can play.  We could opt for direct election, just like the Irish. Enter the critics threatening the nightmare of Presidents Hattersley or Thatcher - though if that truly is a nightmare, the electorate is hardly likely to vote for it. Besides, one could easily write the rules to prevent any past politician seeking the job. When one looks at the success of Mary Robinson or Mary McAleese in Dublin, direct election looks quite appealing.  For those who suspect a directly-elected president with a national mandate would be too strong a rival for the rest of our politicians - chiefly the prime minister - to tolerate, then indirect election is the obvious alternative. At present MPs, who we vote for, choose the Speaker - and that person could easily double as head of state, even taking on the weighty task of picking which leader should form a government from a hung parliament. Some would say that would give the Speaker too much power, especially if Britain were to adopt proportional representation. But that power already exists -resting in the hands of a hereditary monarch nobody chooses and nobody can remove.  There are plenty of variations: including activist Anthony Barnett's notion that a ""royal family"" should be chosen by random lot, like jury service, once every three years. Reformers argue that Britons can do it however they like - just so long as, for the first time ever, they choose their own head of state.  The benefits, they say, will be subtle, but real. For Britons will do more than choose the person who ""interprets the nation to itself"". By asserting themselves, rather than the crown, as the governing force in British life, they will become the owners of their own country - insisting that it is their land, not the crown's, that it is their government, not Her Majesty's, and that nothing is beyond their reach. Britons will be owners, not tenants, of their country; citizens, not subjects.

0,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's been the rallying cry of the defenders of our ancient, unwritten constitution through the ages - if not always in those words. Sure, say the old guard, our patchwork quilt of unspoken custom and tacit tradition may not make logical sense when set out on a clean sheet of paper - that's one good reason why we keep it unwritten. But, insist the keepers of the flame, our non-systematic system has held up just fine for centuries. So long as it still works, there's no need to change it. The trouble is, that's no longer true. The system is not working: it is broke - and we need to fix it. For the test of any constitution is the quality of governance it produces. In just the last few years we have seen all too clearly how well our system works: from the great pension scandal of the mid-1980s to the BSE calamity of the 1990s, from the outbreak of sleaze to the sell-off of our railways, from the poll tax to the debacle of the Dome - the proof is all around us of a standard of government that is just not good enough. In each case the system did not contain the checks and balances, the basic scrutiny, that might have weeded out bad legislation and prevented disastrous mistakes.  This cannot be the exclusive fault of this administration or that individual politician. It happens too often for that. Rather, as both the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair or the Phillips report on BSE concluded, the flaw lies in the system itself - the way we are governed. And that means our constitution.  The British people woke up to this fact long ago, even if few dare say it. Polling data consistently show a decline in esteem for our institutions and the system which links them together. While 48% expressed ""quite a lot of confidence"" in the House of Commons in 1985, that figure had halved by 1995. A year later a European Union poll found that Britons had less faith in their parliament than the people of any member country bar Portugal. Local government's standing has never been weaker, with turnout in council elections dropping like a stone. Trust in our institutions is in freefall, with the young especially disenchanted. One Mori survey found 71%of first-time voters convinced their ballot would ""make little or no difference to their lives"". We are beginning to vote with our feet - by staying away from the polling station. Britain's turnout figures are in decline, with recent by-elections lucky to involve more than 30% of the vote. In one Leeds seat, the turnout fell below one in five of all registered voters. It all adds up to a growing loss of faith in our system of governance.  These trends are not wholly new: reformers have seen the need for a radical overhaul of our constitution for decades. But now there is an extra urgency. For not only is the old system not working well: it is beginning to come apart. Since 1997 Labour has undertaken a raft of constitutional changes so radical they have historians reaching for the 1830s to find a precedent. Whether it's the rolling programme of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland or the partial reform of the House of Lords, the current government has shattered forever the traditionalist belief that our system is a frail, mystical thing that belongs in a glass case and can never be touched by human hand. The conservative conviction that the constitution has remained unaltered for centuries - and therefore cannot be changed in future - is gone. The patchwork quilt can be repaired and even renewed: after all, it's unravelling already.    <B> Four nations</B><BR>  Specifically, Labour's changes have exposed to the light questions that had long been buried - and which now demand to be answered. Take devolution. Until 1997 Britain had never really come clean about its true nature as a multi-national entity: the four constituent nations each had their own cabinet department, but Britain was essentially a unitary state governed from Westminster and Whitehall. Devolution has blown that apart.  It has forced us to recognise that there are distinct countries within Britain, each with the right and ambition to govern itself - whether through a parliament in Edinburgh or assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast. The days of crypto-federalism seem to be over: thanks to devolution, Britain has acted like a country ready to come out as a federal entity.  But not completely. For Labour's decentralisation may have brought to the surface a clutch of dilemmas about Britain, but it has not resolved them. So, for example, most Britons now accept that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland deserve home rule - but what about England? Should Westminster serve as a federal legislature, dealing only with UK-wide problems - or should it double as a de facto English parliament? Why does one of the island nations, Scotland, have more autonomy than the others? Who should sit and vote in the Westminster   parliament; in the terms of the famed West Lothian question, why should Scottish MPs vote on exclusively English matters when English MPs have no say on exclusively Scottish ones?  What Labour has done is to open a can of worms: the worms were always there, we just couldn't see them before. Now the can is open we cannot look away. Perhaps the best illustration is the House of Lords. Some around Tony Blair might once have thought that expelling all but 92 of the hereditary peers would solve the problems of Britain's second chamber. Instead it's done the opposite, suddenly drawing attention to the absurd democratic deficit in parliament. When the hereditaries were there, the whole body could be written off as some Ruritanian joke. But Blair's reforms have prompted Britons to take a closer look. They now see a supposedly reformed second chamber barely more democratic than the blue-blood body it replaced - in which not a single member is elected. Leaving well alone, as the Tories used to advocate, was one thing. Now, say many Britons, if you're going to tinker with the upper house, you might as well make it democratic.    <B> Shattered mystique</B><BR>  And that's a view which is beginning to apply to our entire constitution: now that Labour has broken the taboo by daring to change it, logic demands that it be changed properly - and democratically. For the current, spatchcocked arrangement of old custom and New Labour modernisation risks being the worst of both worlds, creating a constitution that makes no sense and lacks the old (if spurious) defence of ancient continuity. The mystique has shattered at last; now our very system of government is up for grabs. Even the Conservatives are discussing radical, constitutional change: witness William Hague's flirtation with the notion of an English parliament.  There is one last factor which makes urgent our need for a new constitutional settlement. Britain may be an island, but we are not alone. The changes inside the United Kingdom have coincided with profound shifts outside it, too.  We are days away from a summit in Nice which will debate and decide the future shape of the European Union. Who should govern? A simple majority of member nations or each state by wielding its individual veto? How should the peoples of Europe be bound together? With a common currency and a shared military force - or as a loose, free trade area? How should Europe declare its values? With communiques and treaties or with a basic law? In other words, the European Union is in the midst of constitutional upheaval, too.  Beyond even Europe's boundaries, there is a similarly profound argument. The global anti-capitalist movement unleashed in Seattle and Prague asks who should rule the world - its people or the corporations and the World Trade Organisation? On the streets with the protesters or in the summit rooms of Nice, the debate turns on a single word: sovereignty. Put simply, who should be in charge? That's an issue for the world, as it grapples with the domination of Microsoft or Big Oil and gropes for a new regime of global governance. It's an issue for Europe, as it works out whether sovereignty can be pooled or only diluted. And it's an issue for Britain: who is sovereign in our land?  What it all adds up to - the weaknesses of Britain's old system, the changes made by Labour and the worldwide confusion over sovereignty - is a need: we are crying out for a new constitutional settlement. We urgently require a new dispensation that would work better than the current set-up, improve the quality of our governance and yield better outcomes and better policies that would affect all Britons' lives. A new dispensation would also complete some unfinished business left over from Labour's programme of constitutional reform, turning today's ""unsettlement"" into a settlement. For those who care about the survival of Britain that has become an urgent task: for if we do not decide a future for the union of our nations, then that union will simply unravel. Britain will break apart.  Our country needs this new settlement within our borders to work out our place in the world beyond them. Many reformers have argued that so long as we remain confused over our own sovereignty, we have little chance of sharing or pooling it with others. When the relationship between Scotland and England is still vexed, is it any wonder we cannot find the right connection between Britain and France?  We need to make a change. We need to replace an unwritten constitution which consists of one abstract idea - the crown-in-parliament - with a settlement that fits the nation we have become and the world that now exists. We cannot wear the old, moth-eaten garb of the past any longer: we have outgrown it. This is a new century and a new millennium: we need a new constitution. <B>Related stories - news</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - comment</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - background</B><BR>

The hunt for the London suicide bombers, the Scotland Yard commissioner says, is the biggest challenge that the Metropolitan police have ever faced.I'm sorry, Sir Ian, but that's just not true. Bigger than Chartism? Bigger than the Fenians? Bigger than the unemployed demonstrations in the 1880s? Bigger than the Mosleyites in the 1930s? Bigger than the Blitz? Bigger than the urban riots of the 1980s? With respect, I think not.For large parts of the Met's history - perhaps indeed for most of it - Londoners and their police have not lived easily together. The police were imposed on London in the riotous 1820s, and the imposition defined the relationship for decades to come - until well into my lifetime. Policing with consent may be the buzz phrase today but it was not always so. For most of its history the Met tried to recruit from outside London - from the army and from Scotland in particular - in order to maintain a distance from, not a closeness to, the London community. The mythology summed up in the old Dixon of Dock Green image of the 1950s was very largely just that, mythology.That's not to say that there was no truth in the image of the local, avuncular bobby. But it was never the whole story. In Cold Bath Fields in 1833, just around the corner from where the Guardian's offices now stand, police attacked a political reform meeting without provocation and an officer, Constable Culley, was killed by the crowd. Local people made their views clear when a coroner's jury brought in the astonishing verdict of ""justifiable homicide"". Not much community policing there.And so it continued. Half a century later, when police trampled a bystander to death in the original Bloody Sunday riots of 1887, the funeral generated one of the largest and angriest crowds of the 19th century. As the coffin of Alfred Linnell - decorated with the words Killed in Trafalgar Square - was carried to Bow cemetery, the police were greeted with repeated chants of: ""That's your work!"" Shades of Blair Peach a century later.What the Metropolitan police need, Margaret Thatcher once said in that peremptory way of hers, is ""support not criticism"". Yet this was never a universal view. Most people accepted the police, then as now. But support had to be won, and too often it was not. Not for nothing did one young Londoner, Alfred Hitchcock, sum up his views of the police in ways many shared. ""I'm not against the police,"" the great film-maker once declared. ""I'm just afraid of them.""It is hardly surprising that those kinds of views are being expressed yet again this week, after the Met shot Jean Charles de Menezes dead on a tube train last Friday. In the aftermath of this month's bombings there may be as many as 3,000 armed police on the capital's streets, a number that far exceeds either the Met's specialist armed response units or the armed police who guard key public figures and important buildings. In current circumstances that's an awful lot of people in our midst who are all a hair's breadth away from firing at a suspect. With the revelation of the ""shoot to kill to protect"" policy, suspicions must be expected and questions answered. Like Hitchcock, reasonable people may be afraid. The Commons home affairs committee ought to sit immediately.Shootings by the police still remain incredibly rare in this country. In most places, years can go by between one police bullet being fired and the next. But the key question is when it is legitimate. From what has been reported, the officer who killed the young Brazilian last week appeared to act in line with the rules issued under Lord Stevens. In extreme circumstances, he said, an armed officer can shoot a suspect in the head if the intelligence suggests that he is a suicide bomber who poses an imminent danger to the public or the police.At first sight this could be depicted as a radical extension of police guidelines. But is it? A closer examination reveals that it is more a particularisation of appropriate rules that have governed firearm use by police and the military in Britain, especially Northern Ireland, over many years. These rules contain a number of basic principles: that any force used should be the minimum necessary, that force should be used against particular targets rather than indiscriminately, that no more rounds should be fired than is necessary, that an audible warning must be given and that the officer should be certain that the suspect is about to take offensive action.What is important, though, is that the guidelines do not have the full force of the law unless and until they are tested in court. Now, tragically, we have such a case and the issues must be put to the test. Part of one's heart sinks. Matters of this kind have been a legal battleground in Northern Ireland for decades, not least in the Saville inquiry, mainly because of republicans' determination to depict themselves as the victims of British state violence but also because there are real issues of liberty and law at stake. Even Northern Ireland's often-maligned courts have found, for instance, that the mere failure of a suspect to halt when challenged does not justify shooting him.We need to be prepared to make a similar distinction in the De Menezes case. Just because some mischief makers are already trying to imply that the Met has a shoot-to-kill policy against young, dark-skinned men - which it doesn't - this does not absolve either the Met in general or the officers involved from having to answer for their decisions before a proper tribunal. An innocent man has been killed in the effort to protect other innocent people. That action must be judged. That would happen in Iraq and Israel - and in the British army. It should happen here too.The police should not panic about this. Over the past 25 years, largely since the Scarman report, there has been more reform of London's police than in the preceding century and a half. A police force has become a police service. The quality of leadership has been transformed - compare Ian Blair with David McNee - as have the quality and diversity of its officers. Much remains undone. There are too many boys with toys. Politicians still veer away from constructive criticism of the police.But this should not blind us to what has changed. The relationship between the police and Londoners is unrecognisable from what it was. In the McNee era there would have been no apologies and the force would have drawn tightly together, maligning the critics rather than facing up to the criticism. In the Blair era that is not necessary. Dreadful errors will still happen, from which lessons must be learned. The police are not magicians. But the public has learned to trust the police, errors and all, and I think they are right to do so."
1,"Sometimes an apology is easier to give than to receive. We all know it from our own lives. The one who says sorry can sit back, happy that the moral high ground is theirs, that they have done their bit. But the person who has been handed the apology, what can they do? They may not be ready to accept it; they may still feel too bitter to forgive. Yet if they reject it, they will be damned as obstinate and mean-spirited. As it is around the kitchen table, writ small, so it is in Northern Ireland this week, writ large and tragic. On Tuesday the IRA offered its ""sincere apologies and condolences"" to the families of those ""non-combatants"" it killed or injured during the 30 years of the Troubles. In a statement cast more in the language of psychotherapy than armed struggle, the IRA declared an end to ""denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt"". In nine short paragraphs, the IRA used the word hurt three times, pain and grief twice each. And, in a break from past form, it blamed the British government not once.  Still, like so many apologies, this one will not be enough to heal the divided Northern Irish family. You could tell that straightaway. Some unionists followed the lead of Tom Donnelly, whose sister was killed on Bloody Friday - the 1972 IRA atrocity the imminent anniversary of which prompted the latest statement. He confessed himself overwhelmed by the apology, which he said gave him great hope.  But others, perhaps most, were cynical. They dismiss the IRA's words as yet another ploy by the republican movement to further its own political ends.   Specifically, they note a looming deadline: next Wednesday the British government has to declare whether or not the IRA is sticking to its ceasefire. If the answer is no, then Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble - who set the deadline - will demand Sinn Fein be ejected from Northern Ireland's self-ruling executive. To sceptical unionist eyes this week's apology was ""pure PR"", an IRA attempt to get into Tony Blair's good books before judgment day.  Which says something about the mood on the unionist street. Support for the Good Friday agreement remains strong among the business community and the well-heeled. But among the rank and file, says one senior UUP official, deep disenchantment has set in. Plenty of unionists regarded the 1998 deal as a ""moral outrage"" from the beginning - they were only prepared to hold their tongue in the hope that republicans were serious about ""getting out of the violence business"".  But the past 12 months have eroded what little faith there was in republicanism's peaceful intentions, say unionists. Last August's arrest of three republican operatives in Colombia, later charged with collaboration with the FARC narco-terrorist movement, blew the first major hole in unionist confidence. The March break-in at the Castlereagh security building - when ultra-sensitive security files were stolen - and ongoing street violence in Belfast have done the rest of the damage.  Now, say unionists, disillusion is so deep that if elections for the Northern Ireland assembly - due next May - were held tomorrow, Ian Paisley's anti-agreement Democratic Unionists would sweep Trimble's party to oblivion. Blair, they say, has to reassure unionists fast.   One move they would like to see next week, and which they insist is possible, is an American return to the peace process, in the form of a US team flown in to judge ceasefire compliance. Any envoy appointed by George ""war on terror"" Bush would be trusted by unionists and, they say, would buy Trimble valuable time.  That's not how republicans see it. They dismiss the US notion as fanciful for the same, strict reason they apply to all new initiatives: such a mechanism is not mentioned in the Good Friday agreement, which republicans refer to with jesuitical rigour. The same goes for current talk of a possible plea by Blair next week for a ""widening"" of the IRA ceasefire: if it's not in the agreement, it's not going to happen.  Besides, they believe that Tony Blair will not hand down the damning verdict on the IRA that Trimble is looking for: it won't be a clean bill of health from the PM, but enough to keep Sinn Fein in government. Was the apology designed to nudge that along? Few would doubt it. The timing, at least, smacks of the choreographed sequence between the IRA, London and Dublin that has become so familiar.  But don't miss the big picture, say republicans. This apology was ""a big deal"" - a hard move to make for a self-styled national liberation movement, which believes its cause was always just. It was not that long ago that Sinn Fein leaders could barely express regret about bombings and killings. Now the IRA itself, in its own words, apologises for the grief, pain and hurt it has inflicted.  So which side is right: the unionists who dismiss this week's statement as a   self-serving trick or republicans who want respect for having acted honourably? Maybe a useful way to answer the question is with a thought experiment. The year is 2031, and it is early September. Suddenly the TV news hums with word of a statement from the ruling council of al-Qaida. It speaks of regret for the suffering it inflicted 30 years earlier, on September 11.  Would those words heal the families of those lost in New York and Washington? Probably not. But would it say something about al-Qaida's intent to kill again, especially if that organisation had been on a ceasefire for the previous six to eight years? Wouldn't the whole world feel relieved if al-Qaida ever said such a thing?  So maybe it would have been better if the IRA apology had extended to everyone, including the ""combatants"" of the RUC and army, still regarded as heroes by unionists. And maybe the IRA move was prompted by opportunism - but what Machiavellian purpose were republicans trying to pursue, exactly? Only to stay in government, as is their right under the agreement. Like it or not, all these alleged ""ploys"", whether the decommissioning of arms or this week's apology, have been to one end: to keep the peace process afloat, now that republicans have decided that the process is in its own strategic interest.  Republicanism is on a journey, slow and incomplete, away from its paramilitary past to a political future. It is not neat or perfect, but it looks more real with each passing month. Not to see it requires a closed heart, to be sure, but also a pair of closed eyes. In peace processes, as in life, sometimes you have to know how to say yes.","If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Take devolution. Until 1997 Britain had never really come clean about its true nature as a multi-national entity: the four constituent nations each had their own cabinet department, but Britain was essentially a unitary state governed from Westminster and Whitehall. Devolution has blown that apart.  It has forced us to recognise that there are distinct countries within Britain, each with the right and ambition to govern itself - whether through a parliament in Edinburgh or assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast. The days of crypto-federalism seem to be over: thanks to devolution, Britain has acted like a country ready to come out as a federal entity.  But not completely. For Labour's decentralisation may have brought to the surface a clutch of dilemmas about Britain, but it has not resolved them. So, for example, most Britons now accept that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland deserve home rule - but what about England? Should Westminster serve as a federal legislature, dealing only with UK-wide problems - or should it double as a de facto English parliament? Why does one of the island nations, Scotland, have more autonomy than the others? Who should sit and vote in the Westminster   parliament; in the terms of the famed West Lothian question, why should Scottish MPs vote on exclusively English matters when English MPs have no say on exclusively Scottish ones?  What Labour has done is to open a can of worms: the worms were always there, we just couldn't see them before. Now the can is open we cannot look away. Perhaps the best illustration is the House of Lords. Some around Tony Blair might once have thought that expelling all but 92 of the hereditary peers would solve the problems of Britain's second chamber. Instead it's done the opposite, suddenly drawing attention to the absurd democratic deficit in parliament. When the hereditaries were there, the whole body could be written off as some Ruritanian joke. But Blair's reforms have prompted Britons to take a closer look. They now see a supposedly reformed second chamber barely more democratic than the blue-blood body it replaced - in which not a single member is elected. Leaving well alone, as the Tories used to advocate, was one thing. Now, say many Britons, if you're going to tinker with the upper house, you might as well make it democratic.    <B> Shattered mystique</B><BR>  And that's a view which is beginning to apply to our entire constitution: now that Labour has broken the taboo by daring to change it, logic demands that it be changed properly - and democratically. For the current, spatchcocked arrangement of old custom and New Labour modernisation risks being the worst of both worlds, creating a constitution that makes no sense and lacks the old (if spurious) defence of ancient continuity. The mystique has shattered at last; now our very system of government is up for grabs. Even the Conservatives are discussing radical, constitutional change: witness William Hague's flirtation with the notion of an English parliament.  There is one last factor which makes urgent our need for a new constitutional settlement. Britain may be an island, but we are not alone. The changes inside the United Kingdom have coincided with profound shifts outside it, too.  We are days away from a summit in Nice which will debate and decide the future shape of the European Union. Who should govern? A simple majority of member nations or each state by wielding its individual veto? How should the peoples of Europe be bound together? With a common currency and a shared military force - or as a loose, free trade area? How should Europe declare its values? With communiques and treaties or with a basic law? In other words, the European Union is in the midst of constitutional upheaval, too.  Beyond even Europe's boundaries, there is a similarly profound argument. The global anti-capitalist movement unleashed in Seattle and Prague asks who should rule the world - its people or the corporations and the World Trade Organisation? On the streets with the protesters or in the summit rooms of Nice, the debate turns on a single word: sovereignty. Put simply, who should be in charge? That's an issue for the world, as it grapples with the domination of Microsoft or Big Oil and gropes for a new regime of global governance. It's an issue for Europe, as it works out whether sovereignty can be pooled or only diluted. And it's an issue for Britain: who is sovereign in our land?  What it all adds up to - the weaknesses of Britain's old system, the changes made by Labour and the worldwide confusion over sovereignty - is a need: we are crying out for a new constitutional settlement. We urgently require a new dispensation that would work better than the current set-up, improve the quality of our governance and yield better outcomes and better policies that would affect all Britons' lives. A new dispensation would also complete some unfinished business left over from Labour's programme of constitutional reform, turning today's ""unsettlement"" into a settlement. For those who care about the survival of Britain that has become an urgent task: for if we do not decide a future for the union of our nations, then that union will simply unravel. Britain will break apart.  Our country needs this new settlement within our borders to work out our place in the world beyond them. Many reformers have argued that so long as we remain confused over our own sovereignty, we have little chance of sharing or pooling it with others. When the relationship between Scotland and England is still vexed, is it any wonder we cannot find the right connection between Britain and France?  We need to make a change. We need to replace an unwritten constitution which consists of one abstract idea - the crown-in-parliament - with a settlement that fits the nation we have become and the world that now exists. We cannot wear the old, moth-eaten garb of the past any longer: we have outgrown it. This is a new century and a new millennium: we need a new constitution. <B>Related stories - news</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - comment</B><BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <B>Related stories - background</B><BR>

0,"Sometimes an apology is easier to give than to receive. We all know it from our own lives. The one who says sorry can sit back, happy that the moral high ground is theirs, that they have done their bit. But the person who has been handed the apology, what can they do? They may not be ready to accept it; they may still feel too bitter to forgive. Yet if they reject it, they will be damned as obstinate and mean-spirited. As it is around the kitchen table, writ small, so it is in Northern Ireland this week, writ large and tragic. On Tuesday the IRA offered its ""sincere apologies and condolences"" to the families of those ""non-combatants"" it killed or injured during the 30 years of the Troubles. In a statement cast more in the language of psychotherapy than armed struggle, the IRA declared an end to ""denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt"". In nine short paragraphs, the IRA used the word hurt three times, pain and grief twice each. And, in a break from past form, it blamed the British government not once.  Still, like so many apologies, this one will not be enough to heal the divided Northern Irish family. You could tell that straightaway. Some unionists followed the lead of Tom Donnelly, whose sister was killed on Bloody Friday - the 1972 IRA atrocity the imminent anniversary of which prompted the latest statement. He confessed himself overwhelmed by the apology, which he said gave him great hope.  But others, perhaps most, were cynical. They dismiss the IRA's words as yet another ploy by the republican movement to further its own political ends.   Specifically, they note a looming deadline: next Wednesday the British government has to declare whether or not the IRA is sticking to its ceasefire. If the answer is no, then Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble - who set the deadline - will demand Sinn Fein be ejected from Northern Ireland's self-ruling executive. To sceptical unionist eyes this week's apology was ""pure PR"", an IRA attempt to get into Tony Blair's good books before judgment day.  Which says something about the mood on the unionist street. Support for the Good Friday agreement remains strong among the business community and the well-heeled. But among the rank and file, says one senior UUP official, deep disenchantment has set in. Plenty of unionists regarded the 1998 deal as a ""moral outrage"" from the beginning - they were only prepared to hold their tongue in the hope that republicans were serious about ""getting out of the violence business"".  But the past 12 months have eroded what little faith there was in republicanism's peaceful intentions, say unionists. Last August's arrest of three republican operatives in Colombia, later charged with collaboration with the FARC narco-terrorist movement, blew the first major hole in unionist confidence. The March break-in at the Castlereagh security building - when ultra-sensitive security files were stolen - and ongoing street violence in Belfast have done the rest of the damage.  Now, say unionists, disillusion is so deep that if elections for the Northern Ireland assembly - due next May - were held tomorrow, Ian Paisley's anti-agreement Democratic Unionists would sweep Trimble's party to oblivion. Blair, they say, has to reassure unionists fast.   One move they would like to see next week, and which they insist is possible, is an American return to the peace process, in the form of a US team flown in to judge ceasefire compliance. Any envoy appointed by George ""war on terror"" Bush would be trusted by unionists and, they say, would buy Trimble valuable time.  That's not how republicans see it. They dismiss the US notion as fanciful for the same, strict reason they apply to all new initiatives: such a mechanism is not mentioned in the Good Friday agreement, which republicans refer to with jesuitical rigour. The same goes for current talk of a possible plea by Blair next week for a ""widening"" of the IRA ceasefire: if it's not in the agreement, it's not going to happen.  Besides, they believe that Tony Blair will not hand down the damning verdict on the IRA that Trimble is looking for: it won't be a clean bill of health from the PM, but enough to keep Sinn Fein in government. Was the apology designed to nudge that along? Few would doubt it. The timing, at least, smacks of the choreographed sequence between the IRA, London and Dublin that has become so familiar.  But don't miss the big picture, say republicans. This apology was ""a big deal"" - a hard move to make for a self-styled national liberation movement, which believes its cause was always just. It was not that long ago that Sinn Fein leaders could barely express regret about bombings and killings. Now the IRA itself, in its own words, apologises for the grief, pain and hurt it has inflicted.  So which side is right: the unionists who dismiss this week's statement as a   self-serving trick or republicans who want respect for having acted honourably? Maybe a useful way to answer the question is with a thought experiment. The year is 2031, and it is early September. Suddenly the TV news hums with word of a statement from the ruling council of al-Qaida. It speaks of regret for the suffering it inflicted 30 years earlier, on September 11.  Would those words heal the families of those lost in New York and Washington? Probably not. But would it say something about al-Qaida's intent to kill again, especially if that organisation had been on a ceasefire for the previous six to eight years? Wouldn't the whole world feel relieved if al-Qaida ever said such a thing?  So maybe it would have been better if the IRA apology had extended to everyone, including the ""combatants"" of the RUC and army, still regarded as heroes by unionists. And maybe the IRA move was prompted by opportunism - but what Machiavellian purpose were republicans trying to pursue, exactly? Only to stay in government, as is their right under the agreement. Like it or not, all these alleged ""ploys"", whether the decommissioning of arms or this week's apology, have been to one end: to keep the peace process afloat, now that republicans have decided that the process is in its own strategic interest.  Republicanism is on a journey, slow and incomplete, away from its paramilitary past to a political future. It is not neat or perfect, but it looks more real with each passing month. Not to see it requires a closed heart, to be sure, but also a pair of closed eyes. In peace processes, as in life, sometimes you have to know how to say yes.","At a time like this Sir Ian Blair can perhaps be excused his historical exaggeration. The hunt for the London suicide bombers, the Scotland Yard commissioner says, is the biggest challenge that the Metropolitan police have ever faced.I'm sorry, Sir Ian, but that's just not true. Bigger than Chartism? Bigger than the Fenians? Bigger than the unemployed demonstrations in the 1880s? Bigger than the Mosleyites in the 1930s? Bigger than the Blitz? Bigger than the urban riots of the 1980s? With respect, I think not.For large parts of the Met's history - perhaps indeed for most of it - Londoners and their police have not lived easily together. The police were imposed on London in the riotous 1820s, and the imposition defined the relationship for decades to come - until well into my lifetime. Policing with consent may be the buzz phrase today but it was not always so. For most of its history the Met tried to recruit from outside London - from the army and from Scotland in particular - in order to maintain a distance from, not a closeness to, the London community. The mythology summed up in the old Dixon of Dock Green image of the 1950s was very largely just that, mythology.That's not to say that there was no truth in the image of the local, avuncular bobby. But it was never the whole story. In Cold Bath Fields in 1833, just around the corner from where the Guardian's offices now stand, police attacked a political reform meeting without provocation and an officer, Constable Culley, was killed by the crowd. Local people made their views clear when a coroner's jury brought in the astonishing verdict of ""justifiable homicide"". Not much community policing there.And so it continued. Half a century later, when police trampled a bystander to death in the original Bloody Sunday riots of 1887, the funeral generated one of the largest and angriest crowds of the 19th century. As the coffin of Alfred Linnell - decorated with the words Killed in Trafalgar Square - was carried to Bow cemetery, the police were greeted with repeated chants of: ""That's your work!"" Shades of Blair Peach a century later.What the Metropolitan police need, Margaret Thatcher once said in that peremptory way of hers, is ""support not criticism"". Yet this was never a universal view. Most people accepted the police, then as now. But support had to be won, and too often it was not. Not for nothing did one young Londoner, Alfred Hitchcock, sum up his views of the police in ways many shared. ""I'm not against the police,"" the great film-maker once declared. ""I'm just afraid of them.""It is hardly surprising that those kinds of views are being expressed yet again this week, after the Met shot Jean Charles de Menezes dead on a tube train last Friday. In the aftermath of this month's bombings there may be as many as 3,000 armed police on the capital's streets, a number that far exceeds either the Met's specialist armed response units or the armed police who guard key public figures and important buildings. In current circumstances that's an awful lot of people in our midst who are all a hair's breadth away from firing at a suspect. With the revelation of the ""shoot to kill to protect"" policy, suspicions must be expected and questions answered. Like Hitchcock, reasonable people may be afraid. The Commons home affairs committee ought to sit immediately.Shootings by the police still remain incredibly rare in this country. In most places, years can go by between one police bullet being fired and the next. But the key question is when it is legitimate. From what has been reported, the officer who killed the young Brazilian last week appeared to act in line with the rules issued under Lord Stevens. In extreme circumstances, he said, an armed officer can shoot a suspect in the head if the intelligence suggests that he is a suicide bomber who poses an imminent danger to the public or the police.At first sight this could be depicted as a radical extension of police guidelines. But is it? A closer examination reveals that it is more a particularisation of appropriate rules that have governed firearm use by police and the military in Britain, especially Northern Ireland, over many years. These rules contain a number of basic principles: that any force used should be the minimum necessary, that force should be used against particular targets rather than indiscriminately, that no more rounds should be fired than is necessary, that an audible warning must be given and that the officer should be certain that the suspect is about to take offensive action.What is important, though, is that the guidelines do not have the full force of the law unless and until they are tested in court. Now, tragically, we have such a case and the issues must be put to the test. Part of one's heart sinks. Matters of this kind have been a legal battleground in Northern Ireland for decades, not least in the Saville inquiry, mainly because of republicans' determination to depict themselves as the victims of British state violence but also because there are real issues of liberty and law at stake. Even Northern Ireland's often-maligned courts have found, for instance, that the mere failure of a suspect to halt when challenged does not justify shooting him.We need to be prepared to make a similar distinction in the De Menezes case. Just because some mischief makers are already trying to imply that the Met has a shoot-to-kill policy against young, dark-skinned men - which it doesn't - this does not absolve either the Met in general or the officers involved from having to answer for their decisions before a proper tribunal. An innocent man has been killed in the effort to protect other innocent people. That action must be judged. That would happen in Iraq and Israel - and in the British army. It should happen here too.The police should not panic about this. Over the past 25 years, largely since the Scarman report, there has been more reform of London's police than in the preceding century and a half. A police force has become a police service. The quality of leadership has been transformed - compare Ian Blair with David McNee - as have the quality and diversity of its officers. Much remains undone. There are too many boys with toys. Politicians still veer away from constructive criticism of the police.But this should not blind us to what has changed. The relationship between the police and Londoners is unrecognisable from what it was. In the McNee era there would have been no apologies and the force would have drawn tightly together, maligning the critics rather than facing up to the criticism. In the Blair era that is not necessary. Dreadful errors will still happen, from which lessons must be learned. The police are not magicians. But the public has learned to trust the police, errors and all, and I think they are right to do so."
1,"We know it's gripping. We know it's fun. But does it really matter? And does it matter enough to justify the current media hyperventilation about ""the greatest crisis for the royal family since the abdication of 1936""? Certainly not, says constitutional historian and stout royalist Vernon Bogdanor: ""It's a storm in a teacup."" For him, all the Burrell affair has spawned is a string of accusations, aired in newspapers rather than made formally to the police, with nothing proven whatsoever. The frenzied speculation that has been piled on to these fragments of gossip would never have made it into print if the target had been a celebrity or politician, says Bogdanor. ""But because the royal family will never sue for libel and can't answer back, the press has been allowed to run riot. It's a shame, he adds, because after the exertions of the jubilee the Windsors deserved a rest and ""some peace and quiet"".  He is right about one thing. There is no constitutional crisis here: that only happens when the sovereign and parliament are locked in a stand-off which the system itself cannot resolve. We'd have one of those if the Queen refused to sign, say, a law banning foxhunting. We're nowhere near that.  Strictly speaking, 1936 was not that kind of crisis either. Edward VIII always insisted he would go along with the wishes of his ministers and when that meant stepping down, he did as he was told. Even so, the abdication is remembered as a trauma for the royal family - it's the chief reason why the Queen has never countenanced an early retirement for herself - and that is the way the current drama should be judged. As Edward and Mrs Simpson proved, it's not only strict constitutional crises that can rock an institution to its roots.  At first glance, the stakes seem much lower this time: even the most hysterical of pundits is not predicting a 1936-style removal of a sitting monarch. Yet the damage the Burrell saga could yet inflict on the royal family should not be underestimated. It may not be on a par with the abdication, but this is surely the greatest threat to the house of Windsor since then.  For one thing, this affair touches the Queen herself. One of the remarkable features of Elizabeth II's long reign has been her sure-footed avoidance of controversy. Her five decades on the throne have included not so much as a gaffe. Indeed, one thing which has made life so hard for republicans these last 50 years is that the Queen has kept her copybook unstained: she has been the very model of an impartial, above-the-fray head of state.  Only now has she made her first error. Her 11th-hour intervention in the Burrell case - suddenly remembering a crucial conversation with the accused and thereby bringing his prosecution to a juddering halt - has, at the very least, saddled the Queen with the appearance of impropriety. Her failure to step forward earlier with such material evidence looks a lot like obstruction of justice. Her decision to step in when she did - just as Burrell was about to testify, spilling some embarrassing royal beans - looks like meddling in justice to save one's own skin.  A second factor puts the last 12 days into a different category from all the ructions that have gone before. For the talk now is of criminal, rather than emotional, wrongdoing. In the royal scandals of the past, the great revelation was that the Windsors were not as squeaky clean as their ""model family"" image cracked them up to be. Whether it was Margaret's thwarted love for Group Captain Peter Townsend or the icy reception granted to the young Diana, the big discovery was that the royals were all family Christmases on the outside - and cold-hearted dysfunction on the inside. Even the ""war of the Waleses"" in the 1990s merely revealed the prince as a callous man who was unfaithful to his wife. It wasn't flattering, but Charles was accused of nothing illegal, nor anything, in truth, that would make him unfit to be king.  The current scandal is different. Even putting aside the Queen's intervention in the Burrell trial, the latest ""rape tape"" claims pose a threat of a graver order than anything before. At the heart of the matter is the suggestion that St James's Palace hushed up a rape claim made by one employee against a trusted Charles aide. George Smith says he was raped in 1989; there was no investigation until 1996 - and even then, it was the palace, not the police, which did the investigating. Smith also testifies that he saw an incident involving a member of the royal family and a palace servant that, if made public, would cause ""irreparable"" damage. The guessing game about that has begun, and the suspicion is hardening that it was Smith's testimony which the royals were so anxious to keep out of court, and why they moved so swiftly to close Burrell's trial down.  Whatever the truth of Smith's second claim, the suggestion that a rape charge was not pursued in order to save the hide of a Charles favourite is serious business. Forget talking to plants, dreaming of life as a tampon or scribbling nuisance letters to government ministers - this casts the heir not as a crank, but as a perverter of the course of justice. The prince's creation of an internal inquiry is a bad joke: what could be more inappropriate, when the very charge that needs probing is that the palace saw fit to keep out the police and act as judge and jury on its own?   As for the other claims that have filled the popular prints, they could wreak some damage, too. No one minds that there is a gay circle below stairs in Britain's assorted palaces. But they do mind when they hear of high-value gifts, undeclared and sold on for profit. They do mind when they hear accusations of a corrupt, closed world where serious crimes can go unpunished. The closest parallel here is with Tory sleaze.  In the end, the details mattered less than the vague sense that the Conservatives believed their power was so unchallengeable they regarded themselves as above the law. If Britons come to see the Windsors the same way, as ridden with royal sleaze, it will be a hard view to shift. As the Tories have learned to their cost, sleaze can blight an institution.  And this, perhaps, is the biggest danger of all. The royalists' strongest argument is that the monarchy alone serves as a channel, connecting the British people to its past. That unique bond was on show at the death of the Queen Mother, they say. But what happens if that channel starts getting clogged with a whole lot of other emotions? At Sunday's remembrance ceremony, the Queen laid a wreath for our fallen service men and women. Today she will open parliament. She can perform that role partly because she has lived through some of the very moments of British history she symbolically commemorates, and also because her personal record has been so clean. But would we see a future King Charles the same way - especially if there was not just a crown but a legal question mark hovering above his head?","Sometimes an apology is easier to give than to receive. We all know it from our own lives. The one who says sorry can sit back, happy that the moral high ground is theirs, that they have done their bit.

It may not be on a par with the abdication, but this is surely the greatest threat to the house of Windsor since then.  For one thing, this affair touches the Queen herself. One of the remarkable features of Elizabeth II's long reign has been her sure-footed avoidance of controversy. Her five decades on the throne have included not so much as a gaffe. Indeed, one thing which has made life so hard for republicans these last 50 years is that the Queen has kept her copybook unstained: she has been the very model of an impartial, above-the-fray head of state.  Only now has she made her first error. Her 11th-hour intervention in the Burrell case - suddenly remembering a crucial conversation with the accused and thereby bringing his prosecution to a juddering halt - has, at the very least, saddled the Queen with the appearance of impropriety. Her failure to step forward earlier with such material evidence looks a lot like obstruction of justice. Her decision to step in when she did - just as Burrell was about to testify, spilling some embarrassing royal beans - looks like meddling in justice to save one's own skin.  A second factor puts the last 12 days into a different category from all the ructions that have gone before. For the talk now is of criminal, rather than emotional, wrongdoing. In the royal scandals of the past, the great revelation was that the Windsors were not as squeaky clean as their ""model family"" image cracked them up to be. Whether it was Margaret's thwarted love for Group Captain Peter Townsend or the icy reception granted to the young Diana, the big discovery was that the royals were all family Christmases on the outside - and cold-hearted dysfunction on the inside. Even the ""war of the Waleses"" in the 1990s merely revealed the prince as a callous man who was unfaithful to his wife. It wasn't flattering, but Charles was accused of nothing illegal, nor anything, in truth, that would make him unfit to be king.  The current scandal is different. Even putting aside the Queen's intervention in the Burrell trial, the latest ""rape tape"" claims pose a threat of a graver order than anything before. At the heart of the matter is the suggestion that St James's Palace hushed up a rape claim made by one employee against a trusted Charles aide. George Smith says he was raped in 1989; there was no investigation until 1996 - and even then, it was the palace, not the police, which did the investigating. Smith also testifies that he saw an incident involving a member of the royal family and a palace servant that, if made public, would cause ""irreparable"" damage. The guessing game about that has begun, and the suspicion is hardening that it was Smith's testimony which the royals were so anxious to keep out of court, and why they moved so swiftly to close Burrell's trial down.  Whatever the truth of Smith's second claim, the suggestion that a rape charge was not pursued in order to save the hide of a Charles favourite is serious business. Forget talking to plants, dreaming of life as a tampon or scribbling nuisance letters to government ministers - this casts the heir not as a crank, but as a perverter of the course of justice. The prince's creation of an internal inquiry is a bad joke: what could be more inappropriate, when the very charge that needs probing is that the palace saw fit to keep out the police and act as judge and jury on its own?   As for the other claims that have filled the popular prints, they could wreak some damage, too. No one minds that there is a gay circle below stairs in Britain's assorted palaces. But they do mind when they hear of high-value gifts, undeclared and sold on for profit. They do mind when they hear accusations of a corrupt, closed world where serious crimes can go unpunished. The closest parallel here is with Tory sleaze.  In the end, the details mattered less than the vague sense that the Conservatives believed their power was so unchallengeable they regarded themselves as above the law. If Britons come to see the Windsors the same way, as ridden with royal sleaze, it will be a hard view to shift. As the Tories have learned to their cost, sleaze can blight an institution.  And this, perhaps, is the biggest danger of all. The royalists' strongest argument is that the monarchy alone serves as a channel, connecting the British people to its past. That unique bond was on show at the death of the Queen Mother, they say. But what happens if that channel starts getting clogged with a whole lot of other emotions? At Sunday's remembrance ceremony, the Queen laid a wreath for our fallen service men and women. Today she will open parliament. She can perform that role partly because she has lived through some of the very moments of British history she symbolically commemorates, and also because her personal record has been so clean. But would we see a future King Charles the same way - especially if there was not just a crown but a legal question mark hovering above his head?","To be honest, I rarely believe the Queen when she addresses the nation; the Christmas number is too much of a duty call, and when she has anything to do with parliament, she always looks slightly sour - as we all would, I'm sure, were we required to endorse absolutely everything, while still pretending to be in charge just to save trouble.When she spoke at the second world war commemoration, though, everything was spot on. You can believe in the debt she feels to the veterans' generation, and the continuing resonance its sacrifices have for her. The only jarring note was this: sandwiched between references to their ""resilience"" and ""courage"" was mention of their ""sense of humour"".I don't think I'm being unfair to her majesty when I say this isn't a language I'd expect her to understand, still less namecheck as a national boon. There is certainly no public record of her ever having made a joke, unless her experiment with crossing the short-legged corgi with the shorter-legged dachshund was actually done in the name of humour. There is likewise no photographic record of her laughing or smiling, apart from when Motivator won the 2005 Derby, earning the monarch ... well, I have no idea what her bet was, but even it was a fairly modest sum, that still leaves a smile related to acquisition, rather than actual mirth.This isn't just blinkered republicanism - there are royals who manifestly have a laugh. Princess Margaret was one; I fancy that Prince Andrew sometimes enjoys a joke or two, albeit of a coarse and obvious nature. I am speculating wildly, but he has the big mouth of a man who likes to laugh.The point is, though, that if you were to find anyone with a solid and expressible sense of British identity, then definitely in their top five, and probably their top two, would be the royal family and A Highly Developed Sense of Humour. There are a number of contradictions here: for a start, our figurehead lacks the one quality that we think recommends us; and the minute you start pontificating on the quality of your humour, it almost certainly rules out the possibility that you have any. But modern nationhood is a complicated business, so you'd expect anomalies.The substance of our fabled wit, as we see it, is this: first, it is much more advanced than any other country's, especially Germany. When people discuss the Blitz spirit, it is very often in terms of the cockney sparrows who lose a leg and then make a hilarious pun about getting legless. We are happy to admit that our bombing of German cities was as devastating as theirs of ours, but we are absolutely determined that it go down in the annals: whoever bombed whom to pieces, we definitely had the most fun. Oh yes. Humour is bound up with pluck and stoicism, as if its prime function were to keep our mouths so occupied with drolleries that moaning and whining were literally impossible.This is something that came out immediately after last week's bombing, a swell of pride in the age-old grit of the Londoner, another bad thing happening without denting our character. It was different to the response in Madrid. The underlying feelings - shock, mourning, sympathy, defiance - were the same, but where they took to the streets to vent them, we have been rigidly business-as-usual.That's not to say that there was an instant cache of tube-bomb jokes circulating over the net - that may happen and it may not. My feeling is that we've all lost our stomachs for the hilarity of breaking the bereavement taboo, which is why disasters such as Beslan or the tsunami spawned nothing like the one-liners they used to.But whether we ever joke about the attack itself is irrelevant. The capital, even by Thursday evening, had its sense of humour back: grim, black and muted it may have been, but the pubs were full. In other cultures, resilience is manifested in dignity and vigil, but here we manifest it exactly as the Queen said: with a sense of humour. We must be OK, because we're ready with our poor wordplay once more.I think this explains why figures such as Ken Livingstone are more welcome in bad times than Tony Blair - not because Ken is incapable of gravitas, but because we know his base register is more skittish and mischievous, closer to the normality we seek instantly to resume.The funny thing is, disasters aren't that funny. Thursday wasn't, and I'm sure the Blitz wasn't exactly a laugh. To take pride in such a response is quirky - but if even the Queen has noticed, it must be true."
1,"We had a traditional Christmas. The pilot light went out in the boiler. My mother was bad-tempered. The giblets made the dog sick. Sheffield Wednesday lost. But one unexpected incident shone more brightly than the star in the east. Princess Anne's behaviour immediately after she had celebrated the birth of the Prince of Peace made it the most memorable season of goodwill for years. I offer her royal highness my humble congratulations and hope it is not lese-majeste on my part to add: ""Keep it up, Ma'am. Keep it up."" Endpiece readers may not be familiar with what happened outside Sandringham Church - and may find the details of the story difficult to believe even when they hear them. But they were reported in the tabloid newspapers and are therefore beyond dispute. A 75-year-old lady called Mrs Halfpenny made a basket - plaiting the wicker with her own hands - and filled it with flowers. 
She then travelled half the length of the country in the hope of presenting it to the Queen Mother as the royal family left the Christmas Day morning service. As the object of her affection was absent she handed her gift to one of the royal princelings in the hope that it would be passed on. On hearing these details, Princess Anne observed: ""What a ridiculous thing to do.""  The only serious complaint that can be made about the Princess Royal's behaviour is that her understatement did less than full justice to the absurdity of Mrs Halfpenny's conduct. I suspect that somewhere in Windsor castle there is a room full of home-made wicker baskets which an under-footman will be commanded to destroy on an appropriately discreet occasion. Perhaps that is how the fire started seven years ago.   However, we can be pretty sure that at least Mrs Halfpenny has learned the idiocy of her ways. She confessed that she was so anguished by Princess Anne's reproof that she had totally ""lost faith in people"". Her hopes for mankind were completely extinguished by the royal suggestion that her basketwork and flower arrangements were a waste of time.  I am anxious not to add to Mrs Halfpenny's trauma, but the only plausible excuse for her conduct is the undoubted fact that proximity to a member of the royal family makes normally sensible people do and say silly things. And - since she clearly believes that the Queen Mother is sanctified - that explanation may only increase her   distress. So I simply say in mitigation of her madness that her sort of lunacy is encouraged by newspapers which write about the Windsors with what can only be described as intrusive reverence. The Halfpenny incident provided a perfect example.  Editors who thought it necessary to defend Princess Anne against the allegation that she had spoken the truth, offered the excuse that her normally equitable temper had been disturbed by concern about her daughter's health. Apparently Zara Phillips sustained superficial cuts and bruises in a motor accident which occurred about a week before Basketgate. The notion that prolonged maternal anxiety induced Princess Anne's impatience with an elderly sycophant is difficult to sustain. However, a couple of weeks ago we were subject to an even better example of the absurd way in which newspapers treat the royal family.  The same Zara Phillips had another accident. She fell down while playing hockey. Little as I know about the game, I suspect   that falling down is quite a common occurrence. But Ms Phillips's tumble became national news. And the trip or stumble was not the most sensational part of the story. What amazed the royal correspondents was the way in which the Queen's athletic granddaughter got to her feet and resumed the game as if she was a hockey-playing commoner. The sensational news that Ms Phillips sometimes behaves normally was no more than the approach march to the main assault on our intelligence. The blitzkrieg of banality was the carefully managed photo opportunity of Prince William behaving naturally in Patagonia.  No doubt Mrs Halfpenny thrilled to the spirit of the heir to the throne (once removed) cleaning out lavatories. I just regret that a country which pretends to be grown-up salivates over such trivia. One of the most cogent arguments for a republic is that the existence of a monarchy encourages us to do and say silly things. Happy new year, Princess Anne.  <A","Allegations that the BBC is part of an international Marxist conspiracy have always seemed to me to be the feverish product of demented rightwing imagination. An organisation which cannot arrange taxis to take home Newsnight contributors is unlikely to play a significant part in a plot to take over the world. But last Wednesday night - just for a moment - I wondered if the hidden hand of anarchy had organised its coverage of the Missing Golden Jubilee Street Party Sensation. All the people who were invited to reassure an anxious country that the bunting would be put up in the nick of time were exactly the sort of characters calculated to dampen the festive spirit for ever. Prominent among them was Lord St John of Fawsley (n Norman St John-Stevas) who was introduced as a friend of the royal family. He was loquaciously supported by Nicholas Soames, the Prince of Wales's fox-hunting friend and Lord Sterling, the chairman of the P&amp;O shipping line and the man billed as organising the days (or is it weeks?) of national rejoicing. None of them showed the slightest understanding of why enthusiasm is in such short supply.  Their certainty that it would be all right on the night - and presumably during the day when the balloons are released and fish paste sandwiches handed round - was based on the conviction that Her Majesty's loyal subjects are notoriously indolent folk who, reminded of their duty by men of officer calibre, would rise to the occasion. After all, we were not prepared for war in either 1914 or 1939. But, in the end, we triumphed over adversity. There was some suggestion that the local government street party regulations were more formidable than the Wehrmacht. But, given the right leadership, Tommy Atkins and his pals would win through.  The truth is that the whole idea of golden jubilee celebrations is out of date. It is part of the myth of Merrie England - cheerful cockney sparrows doing the Lambeth Walk and lads and lassies from Lancashire clog dancing. Apparently both those rituals were a feature of George V's silver jubilee in 1935, when more sensitive citizens chose to celebrate Sheffield Wednesday winning the cup. This year, the only Pearly Kings that we are likely to see will be wheeled out for foreign television reports on the quaint habits of Olde England. On the Queen's silver jubilee, that ancient country had not quite disappeared into a haze of email messages, continental holidays, designer jeans and digital television. It has now.  The idea of a jubilee, in which the people carefully organise spontaneous cele brations of love and loyalty, is simply old-fashioned. The torpor which follows its every mention has, much to my regret, little or nothing to do with a sudden increase in opposition to the monarchy. Support for a grown-up constitution is growing. But there is nothing like a majority for a republic. There is, however, a general inclination to behave in a way which is consistent with 21st-century realities. Cardboard policemen's helmets, with ""God Save the Queen"" instead of ""Kiss Me Quick"" across the front went out when Channel 4 and discotheques came in.  There was much to be said in favour of the lost age of innocence. Not the least of its virtues was the spirit of community that made the street parties, the recreation ground bonfires and the community association dances possible. A young mother, cross-examined on television about her failure to organise any events, explained that, since she did not know her neighbours' names, the task was beyond her. I regret the passing of the old spirit of comradeship and   concern. But it has happened and Lords Fawsley and Sterling, even assisted by Mr Soames, are no more likely to recreate it for a day than they are to spend more than a fleeting photo-opportunity at a street party themselves.  Frankly I resent them making the attempt - partly because the careless individualism which has taken its place has been ruthlessly promoted by their class and their political party. But my real objection is to the impertinence of their approach. The nobs telling the proles where their duty lies is always an unpleasant sight - especially when the message is to ""show proper respect"". There will be no more patronising display this year than the triple assurance that the working classes (although a bit slow to understand) have their hearts in the right place.  I will bet my bottom euro that, when the time comes, the working classes will feel quite well disposed towards the Queen and think that she should be congratulated on 50 years of meritorious service. But, God willing, they will not perform like characters from one of those gritty industrial novels which were so popular when Her Majesty was crowned. The anachronisms can be safely left to Mr Soames and Lords Sterling and Fawsley."

Down there in Greenwich, it's a long way from being in your face, even for most Londoners. For the nation, on whose children the prime minister once said the dome should confer ""memories so strong that it gives them that abiding sense of purpose and unity that stays with them through the rest of their lives"", it could be on another planet. But let memory speak, before the monster goes. It has been the most particular and incontestable folly of our time. The physical distance assists the political amnesia. It's hard to find any politician who will talk about the dome now. Lord Falconer shuffles forward to mutter about an exit strategy, while Chris Smith is compelled, as a coda to the disaster the government set in train, to pour another £29m of lottery money down the Greenwich drain, the better to ensure that this exit, selling off the asset for a fraction of what was put into it, can duly happen. The announcement is as blithe as it is insulting. Otherwise, what's past is past, we're told. Time to move on. Time to talk about Tate Modern, an altogether superior monument built from the pockets of the poor who finance the lottery. The dome? Forget it.  This request I cannot meet. Somehow boredom wouldn't measure up. There was such grandeur here that slinking silently away would do an injustice to history. And history was the frame. Greenwich is the home of time, the government said. This was why   Britain had a special duty to put on a millennial event that would lead the world and startle all who came from the ends of the earth to see it. The dome would ""make a statement for the whole nation,"" said Mr Blair. It was the way for us ""to take stock of ourselves"". How, by that test, do we look?  The amount of lottery money consumed on the dome is closing in on £550m. Only half the expected audience have so far been willing to pay out of their own pockets for the experience. For this financial failure, they themselves, the British and global public, are to blame. Damn the punters, they inexplicably found better things to do. So the first thing we look, as a nation, is culpable. We let our prophets down. We didn't do what we were told.  But this was because we were not properly informed. The public is one scapegoat, the media are another. Asked a few awkward questions, Michael Heseltine, who can be called the dome's first begetter, was anticipating this before the money had been spent. ""It's virtually impossible,"" he said, ""to do anything in this country of any imagination without the media trying to vilify and ruin it."" He was highlighting another national defect. We are apparently credulous in overlooking a brilliant creation just because a bunch of malign journalists tell us to. Or so the minister said.  
These are insignificant alibis for the truth. They spread the blame for the humiliating embarrassment the dome has become, so that we are all somehow guilty. Yet there has never been a project that grew so particularly and exclusively out of the preoccupations of the political class, irrespective of party, and the self-glorifying inanity in which its leaders are capable of collaborating as long as someone else pays.  The dome began as a Tory project, the last resounding belch of a dying regime. Promoted by the grandiloquent Heseltine and seized on by the cringing Mr Major, father of the lottery, it was supervised in the early stages by Virginia Bottomley and cheer-led by a variety of architects and propagandists with their own half-baked ideological, not to mention commercial, agenda for this way of proclaiming national greatness past and future - an assertion no other nation in the world felt that 2000 AD required it to make.  An additional rationale was proposed, concerning the renewal of poisoned land on the Greenwich peninsular. But it was never explained why this could be achieved only by the erection of a white elephant consuming, in all, £800m. History, and politics, were at the heart of it. Tories, when drawn into a discussion of their part, still contend that if a thousand years of history   had remained the millennial motif, a triumph was guaranteed. It was New Labour's obsession with modernity, they say, that confused an otherwise flawless project.  But New Labour was on board before the Tories' fall. The consensus was all but sealed. Given the chance in May 1997 to act like a new regime, unneedful of hyperbole, Mr Blair decided he couldn't let the old, dead, corrupted one outflank him in nationalistic display, however pointless. Nobody ever answered the question about what the dome was for, except for that. Miles of verbiage and armies of consultants, up to the very millennial moment, addressed the question of content and purpose, but none was able to improve on Heseltine's best shot: ""It's going to be quite wonderful but don't ask me how"". They still can't. Made manifest before our eyes, the dome declared its irretrievable emptiness.  Many political projects turn out to be less than perfect. Most, indeed, can never hope to succeed in anything but a contingent and partial way. There are always more schools to build and patients to cure. For that reason the political rhetoric attaching to them is almost meant to be taken with a shovelful of salt. The level of pretension is understood to be an aspiration, the money available for its fulfilment is always inadequate. Blaming politicians for their failure is often a ritual that they can deflect with earnest remarks about the sincerity of their efforts. And besides, there's always another party, putting them to the question.  The dome is a different case. Normal lines of responsibility do not exist. It was built with funny money, for which nobody is accountable. The Treasury would never have countenanced tax money being used. No business could have defended such folly to its shareholders. Lottery money, falling outside either discipline, was made available as a plaything for egotistical wasters who invented a national purpose that did not exist. Not a little matter of a few million, either, but a donation of colossal magnitude, deployed by the same people who decided it should be handed out: people of all parties with their fingers in the trough of self-indulgence, leaving none with hands clean enough to do the ensuing scandal justice.  What one misses here is the faintest semblance of regret. No whisper have I heard, from the principals or their auxiliaries, that they may have been responsible for a mistake. Apology seems out of the question. When not whimpering a few resentful words that miss the point, they are silent. They're moving on. The dome was yesterday. Just another well-meaning blip in the awkward lives of politicians committed to national renewal. But it wasn't. It was an avoidable idiocy, which leaves Britain looking like a nation led astray by profligate, self- regarding philistines."
1,"The issue is no longer foxhunting. From now on the argument is about the rule of law. I make no secret of my belief that a civilised society should not allow an amusement which has as its object - or at least its known consequence - the death of an animal. If the right to hunt foxes is a question of civil liberties, so is the right to organise bear-baiting and cockfights. But the debate on that subject is about to be concluded - at least in parliament. No doubt, it will go on in the country. That is the way that free societies behave. Foxhunters will, entirely legitimately, attempt to persuade the House of Commons to change its mind. Today's question concerns how they react to the decision when and while it has the force of law.  There are several precedents to guide their conduct. I spent years of my life telling trade unions that there were no such things as ""Tory laws"". Most of the foxhunting fraternity took the same view. Those of us who told Arthur Scargill to respect the will of a democratically elected parliament are entitled to say the same to the masters of assorted hunts. Indeed, we are entitled to ask what so many people asked us when we were part of what was laughingly called the Labour party leadership. Are persons of influence and authority going to set an example by condemning their lawless associates? That is a question the Prince of Wales now needs to answer. Rumours that he will go on hunting, even when it is illegal, are clearly absurd. A prince who knowingly defied the law could not become king. But last week's events still cause him a problem. The upper-class hooligans who invaded the House of Commons are associated with him in the public mind. The newspapers published photographs of them grinning together, and he is a well-known supporter of the cause which prompted their ""invasion"" of the Commons.  While it was still a legal activity, no one could reasonably feel more than distaste for his hunting enthusiasm. Now that it is about to become illegal, he has a duty to tell the more excitable devotees of the chase that they are no more above the law than the miners were. He ought already to have condemned the Hooray Henrys who disrupted the Commons. The Act of Settlement requires him to protect parliament. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt and put his silence down to slow reaction time. If he remains silent when the promised lawlessness begins, it will be generally assumed that he supports the motorway blockades and the trashing of MPs' constituency offices.   No doubt, apologists for the monarchy will say that he should not be dragged into politics. Right, but too late. Thanks to his hooligan associates, he is already part of the political debate. To preserve his constitutional integrity he needs to say that, emotional huntsman though he remains, he accepts the will of parliament and expects all of his putative subjects to do the same. If Charles III makes the same mistake as Charles I, his defiance of parliament will have less spectacular consequences. But its long-term effect on the future of the monarchy might be more damaging.  People who pay parking fines and get caught on speed cameras are likely to be impatient with the notion that foxhunters are a special legal case. That is the cry of every petty criminal who is caught. The Prince of Wales will not increase his popularity by tacitly subscribing to the view that their cause justifies a privileged position which would be denied to the men and women protesting against   an unjust war and was denied to men at Cortonwood colliery who demonstrated against the decision to destroy their livelihoods.  All the emotive arguments in favour of foxhunting could have been applied to mining 20 years ago, with 10 times more force. Jobs were lost. A way of life was sacrificed. A noble part of our history died. The newspapers which are treating the Commons invaders like heroes need to show a little consistency. And the heir to the throne ought to create a few headlines by speaking up for the law.  Neither the Prince of Wales nor the Countryside Alliance can hide behind the demeaning excuse that the hooligans are an unwanted addition the peaceful protests. Grown-ups have to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. We know, as a result of last week's events, that a lawless fringe - blocking roads and throwing flash bombs at police horses - will always hang round the pro-hunt demonstrations, initially peaceful or not. Someone the hunters will listen to has to demand that the law be respected. The Prince of Wales is the ideal candidate for the job - unless he is a secret sympathiser with the people who hold democracy in contempt.","Driving north with an indomitable determination to allow neither floods nor Railtrack to cut me off from civilisation, I listened to a radio programme in which Michael Wills MP admitted that the prime minister had given him a special task. He is to encourage other members of the government to pay special respect to our national identity - always in their speeches and whenever possible in their policy decisions. People who know Mr Wills tell me that he is among the brightest and best of the new political generation. He will need all his talents if he is to discharge his new responsibilities successfully. For he has to begin by deciding which nation he is going to identify. Then - having chosen between Great Britain, the United Kingdom and the countries which make up the still heterogeneous union - provide a working definition of what the appropriate national identity is. All the easy answers to his questions have more to do with fascism than philosophy.  Let me, in order to avoid the accusation of loving every country better than my own, describe my attitude towards England. It is the only place in which I want to live. Indeed, with the exception of Scotland - in which I spend a couple of happy weeks each summer - it is the only place in which I want to be for any length of time. English is the only language I speak and the only literature I know well. I enjoy England's unpredictable weather and its ever changing landscape. I still hope that the New Jerusalem can be builded here.  So I can answer the question about which national identity matters to me easily enough. I am British only by the legal definition of my citizenship. But I am English by instinct and emotion. However, Mr Wills cannot base his work on any such dichotomy. The national identity which our Scottish prime minister wishes to promote must at least embrace Great Britain. John Major's notion of a people bound together by village cricket, warm beer and old ladies cycling to church will not do for Tony Blair. It will not do for me either. Despite my sentimental attraction to the reigns of Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria (when the idea of England was established) the country in which I want to live is multiracial and more concerned with facing the hard challenges of the future than dwelling on the glories of the past.  There is a ready definition of British nationality which Mr Wills could use as the basis of his work. Quite rightly he has rejected it. It is usually illustrated by a description of territorial acquisitions and claims of military success. Both illustrations lead to the conclusion that there is something superior about this sceptred isle. We can argue about whether of not Rudyard Kipling's reference to ""lesser breeds without the law"" was a statement of his true opinion or an ironic criticism of a chauvinism which he had come to hate. Either way, it an eloquent illustration of what British identity meant at the end of the 19th century.  I fear that Mr Wills's definition, when he hits upon it, will have many of the same shortcomings. If what he said on radio is to be believed, he means to encourage a view of our national identity which is based on characteristic values - love of fair play, belief in justice, devotion to liberty. We can only define Britain by those admirable qualities if we assert or imply that they are absent, or less pronounced, in other nationalities. Are the French less compassionate and the Swedes more intolerant than we are? I am too insular to know the answer. But to suggest that we are superior to them in these respects is not   very different from regarding them as lesser breeds without the law.  In truth Mr Wills's task is no more about encouraging respect for our national identity than it is about deciding whether Shakespeare belongs to England or to the world. His job is to make sure that ministers sound as if they are ""standing up for Britain"". That is an attitude which I wholeheartedly support on those occasions when Britain is right. But that is quite different from defending every element of ""Britishness"" - from outdated monarchy to antiquated independent nuclear deterrent - that the Tory party claim tests the government's love of country.  I feared that before I finished this there would be a reference to ""love of country"" - a phrase which, being properly English, I find embarrassing. So I cover my shame by describing how mine came about. Chickens are irrevocably attached to the first hen they see after they burst from the egg. For all of my formative years all I knew was England. Irrational affection has its advantages. Even when the old bird begins to moult, it remains an object of irrational devotion. But the irrationality should only go so far. Claims to superiority are both demeaning and dangerous."
0,"The issue is no longer foxhunting. From now on the argument is about the rule of law. I make no secret of my belief that a civilised society should not allow an amusement which has as its object - or at least its known consequence - the death of an animal. If the right to hunt foxes is a question of civil liberties, so is the right to organise bear-baiting and cockfights. But the debate on that subject is about to be concluded - at least in parliament. No doubt, it will go on in the country. That is the way that free societies behave. Foxhunters will, entirely legitimately, attempt to persuade the House of Commons to change its mind. Today's question concerns how they react to the decision when and while it has the force of law.  There are several precedents to guide their conduct. I spent years of my life telling trade unions that there were no such things as ""Tory laws"". Most of the foxhunting fraternity took the same view. Those of us who told Arthur Scargill to respect the will of a democratically elected parliament are entitled to say the same to the masters of assorted hunts. Indeed, we are entitled to ask what so many people asked us when we were part of what was laughingly called the Labour party leadership. Are persons of influence and authority going to set an example by condemning their lawless associates? That is a question the Prince of Wales now needs to answer. Rumours that he will go on hunting, even when it is illegal, are clearly absurd. A prince who knowingly defied the law could not become king. But last week's events still cause him a problem. The upper-class hooligans who invaded the House of Commons are associated with him in the public mind. The newspapers published photographs of them grinning together, and he is a well-known supporter of the cause which prompted their ""invasion"" of the Commons.  While it was still a legal activity, no one could reasonably feel more than distaste for his hunting enthusiasm. Now that it is about to become illegal, he has a duty to tell the more excitable devotees of the chase that they are no more above the law than the miners were. He ought already to have condemned the Hooray Henrys who disrupted the Commons. The Act of Settlement requires him to protect parliament. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt and put his silence down to slow reaction time. If he remains silent when the promised lawlessness begins, it will be generally assumed that he supports the motorway blockades and the trashing of MPs' constituency offices.   No doubt, apologists for the monarchy will say that he should not be dragged into politics. Right, but too late. Thanks to his hooligan associates, he is already part of the political debate. To preserve his constitutional integrity he needs to say that, emotional huntsman though he remains, he accepts the will of parliament and expects all of his putative subjects to do the same. If Charles III makes the same mistake as Charles I, his defiance of parliament will have less spectacular consequences. But its long-term effect on the future of the monarchy might be more damaging.  People who pay parking fines and get caught on speed cameras are likely to be impatient with the notion that foxhunters are a special legal case. That is the cry of every petty criminal who is caught. The Prince of Wales will not increase his popularity by tacitly subscribing to the view that their cause justifies a privileged position which would be denied to the men and women protesting against   an unjust war and was denied to men at Cortonwood colliery who demonstrated against the decision to destroy their livelihoods.  All the emotive arguments in favour of foxhunting could have been applied to mining 20 years ago, with 10 times more force. Jobs were lost. A way of life was sacrificed. A noble part of our history died. The newspapers which are treating the Commons invaders like heroes need to show a little consistency. And the heir to the throne ought to create a few headlines by speaking up for the law.  Neither the Prince of Wales nor the Countryside Alliance can hide behind the demeaning excuse that the hooligans are an unwanted addition the peaceful protests. Grown-ups have to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. We know, as a result of last week's events, that a lawless fringe - blocking roads and throwing flash bombs at police horses - will always hang round the pro-hunt demonstrations, initially peaceful or not. Someone the hunters will listen to has to demand that the law be respected. The Prince of Wales is the ideal candidate for the job - unless he is a secret sympathiser with the people who hold democracy in contempt.","In one of their few decision which could be described as being made on the grounds of good taste, the organisers of the Millennium Dome rejected a plan to exhibit 'Piss Flowers' by Helen Chadwick, a series of bronze moulds taken from cavities left after she had risked hypothermia for her art by peeing in the snow during a tour of Canada.  It was felt to be more seemly to replace her holes with an enormous Perspex case filled with tens of thousands of leaf-cutter ants. The insects symbolised 'communal, instinctive minds, working together, carrying bright flecks of leaf along paths designed to resemble the tracks of a silicon chip'. The chips were powering the dotcom companies whose success was thrilling speculators the world over.  Whether the substitution of the ants was much of an improvement was difficult to judge. In their native South America, leaf-cutters are better known for their appetites than their symbolic representation of the internet. About a million march in unstoppable columns which strip trees in the rain forest and munch their way through the crops of destitute peasants with ruthless speed. They are parasitic and mindless agents of destruction.  Speaking of which, the case of Philip Anschutz, the founder and chairman of Qwest Communications, has resurfaced. His American telecoms company had been a wonder of the dotcom bubble. In 1999, Anschutz sold share options worth $1.5 billion (£960,000 million). He picked a good time to bail out of his company. By 2002, Qwest had lost 90 per cent of its value after it admitted inflating profits.  Last week he agreed to pay a $4.4m fine to settle allegations that he had accepted gifts of shares from investment banks which hoped he would send business their way. Despite his record, New Labour considers him a fit and proper person to take over the Dome, its own bubble by the Thames.  Every night I pray that the Dome story will never go away, and it looks as if my prayers are being answered."
1,"It would be wrong to pretend that I was not pleased to join the privy council. In truth I was delighted. After ""shadowing"" Margaret Thatcher for three years, I had hoped to replace her at the Department of Education. But Harold Wilson, offended by a speech in which I had attacked the public schools, exiled me to the Foreign Office to do penance as minister of state. The official letter, telling me that the Queen was ""minded"" to make me Right Honourable, was, I thought, proof that the prime minister had forgiven me. I was wrong. Joining the privy council did, however, improve my formal status. As soon as I promised to defend the Queen against ""all foreign princes, persons, prelates, states or potentates"" I became Right Honourable for life. From then on every postman knew that I was (or had been) a big noise in Whitehall and Westminster. And that is the privy council's principal purpose. Membership is a medal. Old politicians wear the distinction as if it were part campaign ribbon and part wound stripe.  Traditionalists and romantics still pretend that the privy council is more than a footnote to the ""dignified"" - that is to say outdated - part of our constitution. Harold Wilson once assured Richard Nixon that, because he was addressing ministers who had taken the privy council oath, he could speak freely about nuclear strategy. No doubt the secrets of the Pentagon remained secure. But I doubt if it was the promise ""not (to) know or understand of any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against Her Majesty's person, honour, crown, or dignity royal"" which prevented the president's audience from running out of Downing Street to phone the Soviet embassy.  Quoting those words from the privy council's oath is certainly an offence and possibly treason. Members are required to ""keep secret all matters committed and revealed unto you or that shall be treated secretly in council"". So I should not describe the Gilbertian meeting at which I promised to ""defend all jurisdictions, pre-eminences and authorities granted to Her Majesty"". I can, however, reveal that, during the rehearsal which preceded the main event, the secretary to the council felt it necessary to explain why he was anxious about what was to follow. Wallace Rawling, prime minister of New Zealand, had been made Right Honourable in absentia. He would therefore be ""sworn"" separately. The Queen did not like the privy council to drag on.  Joel Barnett (chief secretary to the Treasury) then explained that he wished to swear his oath of allegiance on an Old Testament. Brian O'Malley (minister of state at the Department of Social Services) added that he must have a Douay Bible. Shamed by their bravery into confessing my own heresy, I exercised the dissenter's right to affirm. That left a judge to perform the usual ritual in the first of five separate ceremonies.  The Queen remained calm. But, as we left the audience chamber, Jim Callaghan, one of the old hands who   had been on duty that day, led me towards an archbishop (I think he was York) who was about to do what is required of archbishops before they assume their archdioceses. Putting an avuncular arm round my shoulder, Jim enquired ""Have you met Roy Hattersley? Her Majesty had to keep you waiting because he wouldn't swear on the Bible"".  In the 25 years since that fateful day, I have attended only one privy council meeting. Like most cabinet ministers I was reluctant to waste my time - though at least (unlike some of my colleagues) I was never required to travel to Balmoral for a pointless ceremony which is, at best, a convenient legal fiction built round the senior ministers, judges and archbishops who become Right Honourable as a matter of course.  At worst the privy council is neither an instrument of baronial tyranny nor the last bastion of monarchist power. It is simply pointless. The usual complaint against it (normally made by Tony Benn) is that it is the institution through which orders in council are made and the royal prerogative exercised - both potential abuses of our parliamentary system. But the blame lies with ministers. The privy council only provides the flummery which camouflages their autocracy.  Orders in council are often no more than the mechanism which activates secondary legislation - clauses of an act of parliament which come into force when the orders are made. The real danger to democracy is the royal prerogative. It began life as the instrument by which the monarch overruled Lords and Commons. But after the sovereignty of parliament was established, ministers, acting in the monarch's name, used the prerogative to legitimise decisions which they took without parliamentary approval. Ten years ago, a progressive chief constable - who did not wish to change the character of his police force by equipping it with CS gas - was warned that, unless he ""voluntarily"" accepted the Home Office's instruction, the policy would be imposed on him ""under the royal prerogative"". There was even some talk of John Major using the device to ratify the Maastricht Treaty if the House of Commons would not pass the necessary resolution.  No government could have survived so gigantic an affront to parliamentary government. But the royal prerogative is still used to legitimise smaller acts of autocracy. In other democracies, appointments to the cabinet are ratified (or not) by the legislature and dates of elections are decided by statute. In Britain, ministers take office and parliament is dissolved under the royal prerogative. Do not blame ""the Queen in council"". Power lies with politicians. So does the opportunity for power's abuse.  That does not mean that its judicial committee - which meets from time to time to consider cases of especial constitutional significance - is either powerless or pointless. But, like the House of Lords ""acting in its judicial capacity"", it is just a fancy name for a collection of senior judges. The aura of the privy   council is attached to both institutions because of two peculiarly English diseases - the belief that association with the sovereign reinforces authority and the conviction that antiquity increases respect.  So the privy council is not just an anachronism. It is one of those elements in our constitution which, because they have arcane rules and archaic associations, exist to prove that real power lies in places remote from everyday life. The mystery and magic of the monarchy and everything which flows from it are meant to be living proof of the distinction between them and us. The privy council is part of the deferential society. A genuinely radical government - anxious to promote the idea either of equality or meritocracy - would politely suggest to the Queen that she confirmed her desire to modernise the monarchy   by announcing that she no longer needed ""privy"" advisers.  Yet most meetings of the privy council, although shrouded in secrecy, are concerned only with trivia. The one item of business which I recall was ""to appoint the chaplain of Wadham College, Oxford"", a duty to which the Queen reasonably reacted by asking ""Why do I do this?"" Michael Foot, lord president of the privy council, was ready with an explanation. ""Wadham,"" he began, ""was my college"". There followed a fascinating account of Oxford history from medieval times. We had just arrived at the Reformation when the Queen - with brilliant timing and perfect courtesy - thanked him and declared the privy council over. That is exactly the right attitude towards the whole unnecessary business.  <B>Those Right Honourables</B>There are currently just over 500 members of the privy council, including all senior members of past and present governments.

Nor are they alone. They represent a vital sub-culture that may be a minority but is growing and casts long shadows among the generality of British Muslims. In New Southgate we watched a young British Muslim outside the ninth floor flat of a suspected bomber express his sympathy with the ideas of martyrdom.It's a disconnect that is more general; when the reportedly rational leader of Birmingham's Central Mosque says that he does not trust the word of the police and government about the Islamic identity of the bombers, it is symbolic of what has happened. Britain, the writ of Britishness and what seems obvious to the rest of us leaves a critical mass of British Muslims cold; they refuse to believe what is palpably true. Whatever mix of responses you think are needed to lift the threat of the bombs - changing British foreign policy or sharper intelligence - part of the story will have to be persuading young British Muslims that Britishness is an idea worth a minimal degree of loyalty that inhibits mass murder. The question is whether it's up to such a task. Do the British even have a shared conception of what our identity is?This is a debate where the markers are already being put down by the ascendant right, and the undertones are ugly. Britain is in this vulnerable position, runs the argument, because it has been too liberal across the board - from allowing asylum seekers from Somalia and Eritrea to carelessness about non-English speaking imams spreading jihad in British mosques. On that bridgehead of shared concern, it's not hard to take the conservative argument further; Britain is too polyglot, access to its generous welfare state is too easy and there's been too much concern for tolerance, observance of human rights and concern for the underdog. And this speaks to a so far unspoken but just below the surface sentiment; Enoch Powell's warning that the streets would one day run with blood has been proved right. Britishness must be recast around conservative values and the same mistake not made again.This is all too combustible tinder, but one of the paradoxical saving graces of Britishness is that it is too vague an idea to be deployed in such a way. Whether Norman Davies documenting how Britain has been constructed from successive waves of immigration in The Isles, or historian Linda Colley describing how Britain was essentially an eighteenth century political artefact as the result of the union of England, Wales and Scotland in Britons, both unite to show how the idea of Britain is not a faith like the idea of, say, France, or America - or nationalistic like the idea of China or Russia.It's a political jurisdiction that has common practical mores while allowing our emotional identity to be rooted in one of the tribes from which the country has been constituted over time - English, Welsh, Scottish, Jews - and for immigrants, India, Nigeria or Barbados.Even if we want to make Britishness more assertive and conservative or even to harden it into a citizenship test, it won't wash. One of the reasons Euroscepticism is so difficult to counter in Britain is that beyond the shared political symbols of British sovereignty there's not much more that's common to the story - which is why sovereignty counts so much.You can tell a story of Britain that is about Gray's Elegy, the James I Bible, D-Day and Elgar; or you can tell a story of Britain about the Levellers, Methodists, Monty Python and Willam Wallace. The idea encompasses multiple traditions, stories, tribes and eccentricities; belonging means little more than speaking the language, recognising the complexities and achievements while acknowledging the minimal rules that flow from the political arrangements. The tolerance is in the DNA.The problem for Pakistanis, Eritreans and Somalians is that the tribe to which they emotionally belong within the British accommodation does not command anything like the same loyalty as being British English, British Indian or even British Jamaican. Being British and English, or British and Indian works; being British Pakistani or Eritrean does not. They come from broken-backed countries that have no proud history, culture or identity - Pakistan, for example, is only 58 years old: the identity that makes more proud sense is Islam. And in one jump young British Muslim Somalians, Eritreans and Pakistanis are suddenly in the vortex of a culture and religion profoundly wounded by globalisation, Western foreign policy and its own failure to match the rise of Christendom - with all its capacity to transmute a doctrine of peace into a doctrine of sexism, murder and anti-semitism.Nobody can be sure how it will end, but trying to concoct a new urgent conservative British faith as part of a concerted effort to persuade young British Muslims of the value of their adopted country will not be part of any solution - however much some may wish it. Britishness does not admit of such manipulation, which is why millions of British are so loyal to the idea even while not being overtly loud about it. What will happen, I suspect, is that the British will carry on with their understated Britishness while keeping the invitation open - even to jihadist-inclined British Muslims whose parents came from Eritrea, Somalia and Pakistan - to join the club because in the end, however sorely tempted we are, the invitation can't be withdrawn.It's not how British identity is emotionally constituted. And enough British Muslims will find the same value in the co-existing identities to resist the temptations of jihad, and to marginalize the wannabe murderers in their midst. Indeed, it may be in Britain that radical Islam meets its match; and where Islam starts to convert to modernity. Long odds, maybe - but not impossible."

He is to encourage other members of the government to pay special respect to our national identity - always in their speeches and whenever possible in their policy decisions. People who know Mr Wills tell me that he is among the brightest and best of the new political generation. He will need all his talents if he is to discharge his new responsibilities successfully. For he has to begin by deciding which nation he is going to identify. Then - having chosen between Great Britain, the United Kingdom and the countries which make up the still heterogeneous union - provide a working definition of what the appropriate national identity is. All the easy answers to his questions have more to do with fascism than philosophy.  Let me, in order to avoid the accusation of loving every country better than my own, describe my attitude towards England. It is the only place in which I want to live. Indeed, with the exception of Scotland - in which I spend a couple of happy weeks each summer - it is the only place in which I want to be for any length of time. English is the only language I speak and the only literature I know well. I enjoy England's unpredictable weather and its ever changing landscape. I still hope that the New Jerusalem can be builded here.  So I can answer the question about which national identity matters to me easily enough. I am British only by the legal definition of my citizenship. But I am English by instinct and emotion. However, Mr Wills cannot base his work on any such dichotomy. The national identity which our Scottish prime minister wishes to promote must at least embrace Great Britain. John Major's notion of a people bound together by village cricket, warm beer and old ladies cycling to church will not do for Tony Blair. It will not do for me either. Despite my sentimental attraction to the reigns of Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria (when the idea of England was established) the country in which I want to live is multiracial and more concerned with facing the hard challenges of the future than dwelling on the glories of the past.  There is a ready definition of British nationality which Mr Wills could use as the basis of his work. Quite rightly he has rejected it. It is usually illustrated by a description of territorial acquisitions and claims of military success. Both illustrations lead to the conclusion that there is something superior about this sceptred isle. We can argue about whether of not Rudyard Kipling's reference to ""lesser breeds without the law"" was a statement of his true opinion or an ironic criticism of a chauvinism which he had come to hate. Either way, it an eloquent illustration of what British identity meant at the end of the 19th century.  I fear that Mr Wills's definition, when he hits upon it, will have many of the same shortcomings. If what he said on radio is to be believed, he means to encourage a view of our national identity which is based on characteristic values - love of fair play, belief in justice, devotion to liberty. We can only define Britain by those admirable qualities if we assert or imply that they are absent, or less pronounced, in other nationalities. Are the French less compassionate and the Swedes more intolerant than we are? I am too insular to know the answer. But to suggest that we are superior to them in these respects is not   very different from regarding them as lesser breeds without the law.  In truth Mr Wills's task is no more about encouraging respect for our national identity than it is about deciding whether Shakespeare belongs to England or to the world. His job is to make sure that ministers sound as if they are ""standing up for Britain"". That is an attitude which I wholeheartedly support on those occasions when Britain is right. But that is quite different from defending every element of ""Britishness"" - from outdated monarchy to antiquated independent nuclear deterrent - that the Tory party claim tests the government's love of country.  I feared that before I finished this there would be a reference to ""love of country"" - a phrase which, being properly English, I find embarrassing. So I cover my shame by describing how mine came about. Chickens are irrevocably attached to the first hen they see after they burst from the egg. For all of my formative years all I knew was England. Irrational affection has its advantages. Even when the old bird begins to moult, it remains an object of irrational devotion. But the irrationality should only go so far. Claims to superiority are both demeaning and dangerous."

The anachronisms can be safely left to Mr Soames and Lords Sterling and Fawsley.","The News of the World heaves with self-righteous anger. Mr Richard Desmond's fine Daily Star bathes in fury. The words of James Bulger's mother Denise are spread large across every sheet and TV station in the land: ""I know that no matter where they go, someone out there is waiting."" It is difficult not to feel ashamed of this country. We tut-tut, pruriently horrified, over the public execution of Timothy McVeigh. Our landslide prime minister joins with other EU luminaries to wag a consolidated finger at George Bush's punishing beliefs. Yet any civilised nation, anywhere in the world, would cringe over the punishment we are inflicting on Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Take one dreadful tragedy, stir relentlessly over a decade; then await tragedy renewed.  Some day soon - on an internet website, in a magazine bought at Milan or Madrid airport, after a punch in a pub or a stroke of vile luck - these two 18-year-olds will be ""exposed"". The law is an ass if it thinks that it can guarantee lifelong anonymity to the pair for much over five minutes. What else are ""communities"" but neighbourhoods that watch and talk together?  We may lament such exposure, a continuance of our shame. But big secrets can't be kept forever in a small country. This, more balefully yet, is the old Spycatcher syndrome: judges and politicians don't decide - they have to persuade. And where, pray, is that persuasion?   David Blunkett - at least in the beginning - doesn't even try. He issues one of those the-parole-board-has-informed-me statements which, barely between the lines, says: my hands are tied. The home secretary apparently thinks that holders of his great office, like Michael Howard, avid readers of the tabloids and public-opinion polls are better custodians of juvenile murderers than the judges who heard their cases or the psychologists who have worked to redeem them. European human rights? Forget it. Let's see if we can turn back the clock.  What could his statement - or yesterday's slightly more responsive call for calm - have said?  That here were two kids from fractured, disrupted homes which society - our society - left to fend for themselves. Already victims. They were 10 years old, falling out of the system. They killed a toddler; and the revulsion there is palpable. But what was supposed to happen next? A dose of the junior McVeighs? Obscenely ridiculous. A lifetime behind bars, without hope of release? Barely less obscene. These boys hadn't even had the chance to fail their 11-plus.  Nowhere in mainland Europe is the age of criminal responsibility as low as it is here. Thirteen in Holland, 15 in Denmark, 16 in Spain, 18 in Luxembourg. Anywhere on the continent, Thompson and Venables would not have found themselves in some panoplied crown court listening to men in wigs deciding their fate in language they could not comprehend. They would have been taken away and tended in obscurity - because they were children.  That, in a way, happened here, too. Our secure units are one of the better bits of the system. Robert and Jon have had the care they needed. They have grown up, found themselves and education and remorse. They have come to terms with their malign past. We call it rehabilitation.  Everybody in a position to assess them thinks that they should be released to try to build lives which can never be normal but can, perhaps, be useful and fulfilling. Nobody who knows them today thinks that they should be spun over into adult prisonhood where all the work (and money) invested would surely go to malign waste.  But - David Blunkett could have added - all this patient toil and love stands in pawn today: not from the efforts of those securely inside the unit, but from those outside in the society which first created Thompson and Venables. We dragged them through those adult courts that Europe would despise. We politicians joined the cry for retribution. We judges - like Mr Justice Morland in the case - stripped Child A and Child B of their anonymity so that the flames were fed. We journalists wove the boys of 18 and the kids of 10 into a seamless robe of supposed responsibility. All that was wrong and foolish. We saw the public wrath, the parental grief, and we trembled before it - or rode it out for our own ends. Shame on us.  From that, in turn, inevitably flows the vital factor missing in this equation. Again, ourselves. The courts, which still look inward, clutching their majesty, have ordered lifelong anonymity for these new personalities released into the world.  Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss fears vigilantes hunting two ""uniquely notorious"" lads - ""a real possibility of serious physical harm and possible death from members of the public or from the Bulger family"". Thus the cloaks are cut to cover them while they live. Her injunctions - which may well be doomed because they strain at reality - are only half the story, though.  Lay it out in the clearest terms. This is also our test. So-called ""vigilantes"" are deluded thugs. The pain of the Bulger family is felt but, prolonged indefinitely, it merely builds further tragedy on tragedy. Denise Fergus has other children now: they deserve their normality, too. The memory of Jamie Bulger is best honoured not by vows of eternal revenge, but by closing that door on the past.  The direst test comes not when Thompson and Venables are slipped into the outside world. It comes when, and if, they are discovered. Another media feeding frenzy? More photo-ops for placard wavers? More interviews with outraged neighbours? More politicians hopping up and down and judges eating their dignity?  No: the test is whether, even uncovered, they can be brought to live in peace, to be known but not threatened or ostracised, to be treated for what they have become not what - in childhood - they were. It is a test of our civilisation and our maturity. And leaders who are elected to lead, like home secretaries - should set in directly.  All we have, for the moment, is a dawning of concern (with Ann Widdecombe, to her credit, rather more forthright rather earlier than David Blunkett). But this release is not some neutral act by yet another panel of experts who can be duly excoriated if it goes wrong. It is a decision taken on our behalf because that is the way we have chosen to order our affairs and define our self-image. No ifs, no buts, no facile cop-outs about how five or 10 years more behind bars would have made everyone happier.  Be honest: the time would never have been right. The edge of adulthood is the only point to choose. Heart-searching begins here: and if the home secretary isn't searching hard enough, then the prime minister should be. What's the point of a committed Christian who bites his tongue?"

People who know Mr Wills tell me that he is among the brightest and best of the new political generation. He will need all his talents if he is to discharge his new responsibilities successfully. For he has to begin by deciding which nation he is going to identify. Then - having chosen between Great Britain, the United Kingdom and the countries which make up the still heterogeneous union - provide a working definition of what the appropriate national identity is. All the easy answers to his questions have more to do with fascism than philosophy.  Let me, in order to avoid the accusation of loving every country better than my own, describe my attitude towards England. It is the only place in which I want to live. Indeed, with the exception of Scotland - in which I spend a couple of happy weeks each summer - it is the only place in which I want to be for any length of time. English is the only language I speak and the only literature I know well. I enjoy England's unpredictable weather and its ever changing landscape. I still hope that the New Jerusalem can be builded here.  So I can answer the question about which national identity matters to me easily enough. I am British only by the legal definition of my citizenship. But I am English by instinct and emotion. However, Mr Wills cannot base his work on any such dichotomy. The national identity which our Scottish prime minister wishes to promote must at least embrace Great Britain. John Major's notion of a people bound together by village cricket, warm beer and old ladies cycling to church will not do for Tony Blair. It will not do for me either. Despite my sentimental attraction to the reigns of Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria (when the idea of England was established) the country in which I want to live is multiracial and more concerned with facing the hard challenges of the future than dwelling on the glories of the past.  There is a ready definition of British nationality which Mr Wills could use as the basis of his work. Quite rightly he has rejected it. It is usually illustrated by a description of territorial acquisitions and claims of military success. Both illustrations lead to the conclusion that there is something superior about this sceptred isle. We can argue about whether of not Rudyard Kipling's reference to ""lesser breeds without the law"" was a statement of his true opinion or an ironic criticism of a chauvinism which he had come to hate. Either way, it an eloquent illustration of what British identity meant at the end of the 19th century.  I fear that Mr Wills's definition, when he hits upon it, will have many of the same shortcomings. If what he said on radio is to be believed, he means to encourage a view of our national identity which is based on characteristic values - love of fair play, belief in justice, devotion to liberty. We can only define Britain by those admirable qualities if we assert or imply that they are absent, or less pronounced, in other nationalities. Are the French less compassionate and the Swedes more intolerant than we are? I am too insular to know the answer. But to suggest that we are superior to them in these respects is not   very different from regarding them as lesser breeds without the law.  In truth Mr Wills's task is no more about encouraging respect for our national identity than it is about deciding whether Shakespeare belongs to England or to the world. His job is to make sure that ministers sound as if they are ""standing up for Britain"". That is an attitude which I wholeheartedly support on those occasions when Britain is right. But that is quite different from defending every element of ""Britishness"" - from outdated monarchy to antiquated independent nuclear deterrent - that the Tory party claim tests the government's love of country.  I feared that before I finished this there would be a reference to ""love of country"" - a phrase which, being properly English, I find embarrassing. So I cover my shame by describing how mine came about. Chickens are irrevocably attached to the first hen they see after they burst from the egg. For all of my formative years all I knew was England. Irrational affection has its advantages. Even when the old bird begins to moult, it remains an object of irrational devotion. But the irrationality should only go so far. Claims to superiority are both demeaning and dangerous.","In the early morning rush-hour yesterday not one other soul stepped off the train at Greenwich North: this architectural wonder of a new tube station was empty. Under a wide, windswept sky the dome's great peninsula on the Thames lies deserted. Richard Rogers's iridescent jellyfish hovers there as dazzling as ever with its jutting yellow masts, a famous London landmark now. Forget its hollow contents - at night with the lights playing on the roof, it was as romantic and magical a sight as any in the capital. From the air foreigners arriving lean over and point to it in delighted recognition. But there are now only two weeks left before the government sells it off at a knock down price to the first company willing to take it off its hands fast. The dome is synonymous with disaster. Misfortune, miscalculation, mediocrity and mistake marked its miserable life so far. What government wouldn't want to be rid of it before an election? Even now, further revelation of the Mandelson/Hinduja connection rips another hole in the dome's reputation: the raising of £1m for the abysmal faith zone returns to haunt the place. The National Audit Office looms, scrutinising everything that was done and not done as lottery millions poured in month after month last year.  Robert Bourne's Legacy bid itself is tainted by a fat donation given by him to Labour party funds and a big birthday party thrown for Peter Mandelson. The place is a haunted political graveyard. No wonder they are eager to privatise it quick. But that would be the last and worst mistake of all.  After Nomura pulled out of its plan to keep the dome as a public theme park, Robert Bourne and his Legacy consortium seemed to be all that was left. So they got ""preferred bidder"" status, allowing them to continue negotiating without competition. Their bid is for a ""hi-tech business park"", which means filling the dome with modern offices. Their spokesman speaks of ""major IT companies, professional services, lawyers, accountants and academic institutions"" who have expressed an interest in moving in. Some of them will have technology on display for members of the public interested in viewing their products. Otherwise it will be closed, a private space for ever.  Once sold off, there will never again be a chance to keep this beautiful building on the one of the most dramatic London sites as a public leisure, exhibition and entertainment centre. It has - at great cost - the best transport links, including the river. The leisure industry, say the economists, is the future. London has no other space like it, desperately short of good concert venues compared with every other European capital. The dismal dinge of Wembley Arena, Earls Court or Olympia can't begin to compete with either the glamour or ease of access of the dome. Pop and mega-classical concertgoers, along with sports fans, have always   had to suffer miserable journeys and horrible conditions. Here, already paid for by us, is a place with every comfort and facility. Don't let them sell it off.  PY Gerbeau, until last week the dome's ebullient chief executive, thinks it can be saved. He had to stay silent until his contract ended, but by then Legacy had its peculiar ""preferred bidder"" status: his case may never be put. He has a major financial institution backing him, he has done the sums - and he knows the costings well. The government is full of praise for the way he stemmed the haemorrhage of money from the dome in the final months.  But will they listen - or will they hasten to be rid of it to Legacy? PY plans to run it as a visitor attraction in the day with the present contents enhanced: in the evenings it will be a concert and sports venue. He will build a hotel and conference centre and use the land around the dome as a village of themed restaurants and attractions - no housing or offices. He claims he will get 3m visitors a year and make a profit after two years. He will even offer the government more money than Legacy's timid £50m up front and £100m later. But he needs the attractions inside - especially the dazzling body zone sculpture (one of the few things of beauty). However, along with other key zones, the body will be demolished in two weeks. Will the government stay its hand and consider the PY bid?  The government is now legally bound not to even speak with other bidders. It says it must consider whether Legacy is the best value. But how is that judged without considering alternatives, and above all the public interest? The public has punted up the cash and must have an interest in keeping this great national asset for their own pleasure: £150m is peanuts compared with the near £1bn already spent, when the dome could be secured as a public amenity for ever.  The key to all this is property value. Hotly though they deny it, there is a canny suspicion that the Legacy bid will end up as a property deal. The invaluable land around the dome will be developed, the ""hi-tech"" park within may never quite materialise, never quite find all these tenants it promises. Unused, the dome would dilapidate until someone someday makes a fortune out of the land it stands on. Like the non-development of Battersea power station up-river, glittering promises from developers are not always all they seem. But even if Legacy does all it says, it still shuts down a public place.  Gerbeau's scheme also buys the site, but at least he keeps it as a public space (sale conditions should insist on that in perpetuity). Better still, PY would be quite happy to rent the dome for a fixed number of years which keeps open the option of returning it to public ownership at some future date - if ever an Olympic or World Cup bid required it. The land around is so valuable some could be sold off to create a trust fund for the dome's future. There are much more imaginative ways of saving the dome than selling it off in a hurry to Legacy. By now that will also be the worst political option, the one most likely to dog the government at the election: added to the breath of sleaze will be a grotesque mishandling of a priceless public asset.  Politicians always lag behind the public mood, out of fashion, fighting old battles instead of facing future challenges. This government's 90s mindset still wrestles with clause 4 versus privatisation - dead ducks both. Money is poured into Railtrack in exchange for nothing at all, as if afraid that buying back shares in it is socialism incarnate. They are still trying to sell off the tube and air traffic control against passionate public opposition. Now they want to sell off one of the finest heritage sites in London, just as the Tories very nearly sold off half the National Gallery - saved only by Sainsburys. Mrs Thatcher left behind no monuments but despite its accursed first year, Tony Blair might live to be proud of this one yet."
1,"Prince Philip has done something unprecedented. He has denied, in the strongest possible terms, that he ever called Princess Di a trollop or a harlot in any of his letters to her. This is not very regal behaviour, entering into a media mudfight, but apparently his hands were tied - Prince William had given him an ultimatum, and we can all imagine how shattering that was (""Deny these words, or I'll never look at you shyly from beneath my bambi hair ever again!"" he probably said). Clearly, this kind of nonsense shouldn't detain us for a second, whether true or not. The facts of the matter are in no doubt - the people's princess was doing the nasty with someone other than her husband for some time before their separation. Therefore, to anyone capable of using words like ""trollop"" and ""harlot"" without laughing, that makes her a trollop. It may never be known whether Prince Philip said as much to her face, but since he gets such timeless joy from saying things like ""Gosh, you're very black, aren't you? How hilarious!"" to the faces of black people, it seems unlikely that he curbed himself in the face of the harlot. Anyway, in a case where one person's dead and the other one's cuckoo, it doesn't matter terribly who said what; it only matters that the extant one is behaving rather unusually.  Devout royal watchers will have noticed that Philip made the news twice at the weekend - the other time, it was a brief mention of the fact that he was spotted ostentatiously leashing his Labrador while out walking, in tacit reference to Princess Anne's recent fine under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Obviously, he was making some kind of humorous statement, here: Labradors are charmless hulks of goodwill, they'd never maul anyone.  Perhaps he was saying, ""You crazy members of the public, I suppose you'll want me to leash my Labrador next!"", or perhaps he was saying something else altogether. But the juxtaposition of the two stories does remind us that Princess Anne's case was also unprecedented.  She isn't the first royal to own a dangerous dog, and she isn't the first to cause needless harm to her subjects by failing to do something that anyone with half a brain would have done, but she's certainly the first to be successfully prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act. The Queen, normally a stickler for boring old precedent, also behaved somewhat innovatively during the trial of Paul Burrell. There's certainly no precedent in living memory for a queen to give evidence against herself in a case she really needn't have brought to court, if she'd known she was going to do that (I wonder if she can now prosecute herself for wasting her own time).  All families have to break with tradition at some point, but there is a problem when the royals do it. Not because we set higher standards for them than we do for each other, since we're all perfectly aware how only-human they are. No, it's because precedent is all they've got. Precedent is all that's standing between them and the rest of busted-flush aristocracy; more importantly, from their point of view, it's all that's standing between them and proper income tax.  It is an undisputed fact that nobody accords the royals any constitutional importance whatsoever. Of 101 Labour MPs questioned by BBC1's On the Record, 80% said the Queen should be stripped of all constitutional powers. These people are supposed to be in charge! Why don't they just put their votes where their views are? Because of convention. Why does Tony Blair waste all that time chatting to the Queen, when he has no intention of doing what she says, and she's not going to say anything anyway? Because that's how it's done. Why do we submit to being subjects rather than citizens? Because that's the way it's always been.  If you spend one minute examining their role in the context of logic, rather than tradition, you cannot see the point of them. Even the staunchest monarchists, pressed on this family's purpose, can only come up with one of two things. Either, it's a tourist attraction (which I'd contest - or, better still, offset by building another London Eye). Or, they ask, ""What do we put in their place?"" - well, what indeed? A freely elected president? A toothless but benign head of state? Some kittens?  It doesn't matter, so long as it's been given serious thought; so long as the final decision is reached in accordance with the principles of modern democracy; basically, so long as there is some idea behind it other than ""Let's do what we did last year.""  Now, I'm not necessarily advocating the overthrow of the royal family, since on this issue, more than any other, I feel profoundly indifferent. I merely suggest that they should be a lot more careful, the next time they're tempted to wade imperiously into an issue, thinking to halt our tabloid chattering with one absolute assertion or denial.  Every time they do something they've never done before, however tedious it is, they're clawing through their own safety nets. There may not be much dignity in silence, but there's always a chance we'll forget they're there.","It's a tough call for the policemen in charge of royal protection on the occasion of the family's big shindig. On the one hand, if the amiable hippies in charge of Glastonbury can get their heads around a ticket-only entry system, law enforcement officers of far more advanced jobsworth tendencies should have been able to prevent the gatecrash coup of a comedian dressed as a well-known terrorist. And yet, on the other hand, imagine the conversation - ""I have a man here, sarge, dressed as Osama bin Laden."" ""That's no good. Where's the fun in that?"" ""Well, given that the right-thinking individual doesn't find terrorism in any way amusing, I imagine the joke is that Johnny Foreigner is a funny fellow."" ""Oh, I see, well you'd better let him in, then. That's the theme of the   party."" ""Is that what Out of Africa means?"" ""Yup. Pretty much."" In a craven attempt to get some goods on William's sex life, certain newspapers have decided that his fancy dress idea derives from the hots he harbours for Jessica Craig. According to the Sunday Times, she is a 21-year-old member of ""Kenya's white elite"", though whether you can ascend into this white elite just by being white, or whether you have to be loaded as well, remains unclear (lest there be any doubt, however, she is also loaded).  The historian Andrew Roberts considers the theme as part of the wider family's relationship with the African continent. ""There is an inverse proportion between the amount of time the Windsors spend in Africa and the amount of power they have   there. After decolonisation, they went more and more."" I suppose the message there is that this is a very nice family which just gets along much better with people it is not actively oppressing. The party theme is therefore a loud hello to celebrate the end of a pernicious empire. But really, to interpret this as either a romantic or a political gesture is to back away from the glaring truth that this is party theming as devised by a complete arse.  First, although no reports have been exhaustive on the subject of Will's guest list, all the people who have been mentioned seem to have names that start with Second Earl of ... I wouldn't want to embarrass the palace by checking, but I am prepared to bet that the only black people at the party   were members of the band. While nobody can force a young Botswana-travelled royal to have African acquaintances who are not members of its ""white elite"", the act of making his whitey friends dress up in feathers rather tastelessly underlines the fact. After all, you probably wouldn't have an American-themed party if you had Americans you wanted to invite. They would turn up in their regular clothes, for one thing, and besides, might experience feelings of miffedness.  Imagine if someone in Africa had an English-themed party. There would be a lot of top hats and fans; some Jane Austen wear for people prepared to make the effort; a few wags might arrive with fake 12-bores and try to subjugate the rest of the party (with hilarious results); a costume of an   animal commonly associated with our island (in all probability, a pig) might make an appearance. The japes would be many and varied, but from our point of view, pretty insulting, having fallen back on the keystone cliches of Englishness - that we are starchy, uptight, brutal and we like bacon sandwiches.  Any attempt to represent a nation with its dress is bound to be reductive and therefore dehumanising. It stresses the otherness of foreigners, and rejects the global truth that most people, the world over,   dress more or less the same, apart from the ones who can't afford a telly.  Furthermore, if you look at the individual costumes chosen, you get an even stronger tang of - well, not wishing to bandy the ""racism"" word around too freely, let's call it ""look at the funny natives-ism"". There was a lot of leopard print and snakeskin which (on the basis of only one visit to Africa, granted), I'd say was a closer approximation of a Streatham singles night than an African style statement.  Many of the older gentlemen dressed up in safari suits, which is like going to a Spanish-themed party with a beer, a burger and some vivid red sunburn (sure, there are English people in every country, and they tend to look funny, but you wouldn't say they defined that country's aesthetic). Fergie   wore a long silver wig and whatever the message behind that, I'm sure, even if I knew, I would find it very offensive.  And finally, there is something unsettling about the ongoing (I believe unrequited) love that the posh have for Africa. It does not focus on the realities of its countries in their modern form, but rather is shot through with a plangent nostalgia. And honestly, the subtext of any nostalgia about this continent has to be that it was better when we still owned it.  All told, these are some very murky messages for a 21-year-old to be encouraging. It must be hard to get things right, living perpetually in the public eye. But he could afford to be a lot more dudelike, without getting any less regal."

There may not be much dignity in silence, but there's always a chance we'll forget they're there.","The healthy reaction to the death of a great-grandmother of 100 or so from her family is one of resignation, even quiet relief. She's had a good innings - her three-score years and 10 and then another score and 10. No one wants her to die, but it is entirely human not to be disabled by grief at her passing when her survival would have brought only decline and suffering. If you have similar feelings after the death of the Queen Mother - a woman 99.9 per cent of the country cannot count as a relative or friend - I advise you to keep them to yourself. Her stay in hospital last week revealed to those who work in the 'newzak' business that professional mourners are primed to howl with anguish and to howl down anyone who can't counterfeit pain. A gruesome media underworld starts to rumble whenever there's a royal health scare. BBC executives check if the afflicted is on the 'A-list' consisting of the Queen Mother, Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, or the 'B-list' of Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Edward Wessex and an unfortunate Duke of Edinburgh, who was relegated by the corporation last year - presumably for scoring too many own goals. Death in the premier league guarantees that scheduled programmes are replaced with funereal music before days of commemorative documentaries and moist news reports begin. B-list royals get second-rate tributes.  All broadcasters and newspapers, meanwhile, receive holding obituaries, stories and even leading articles from the Press Association news agency. Last week's flood of anticipatory copy included a suggested editorial for dunderheaded journalists unable to compose one themselves. ('The nation will mourn with gratitude the life of and service of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, ""Queen Mum"" to millions throughout the world.')  We learned from a separate piece you may read one day in your morning or evening paper or hear parroted on Radio 4 that as her body lies in state at Westminster Hall, 'vast crowds are expected to queue to file past the coffin. It will be placed high on a purple-draped catafalque on the same spot where King George VI lay in state in February 1952, and will be guarded round-the-clock by a contingent of Gentleman at Arms and Yeomen of the Guard. The ancient hall is an incomparable setting for the public's tribute to the royal lady they have loved and respected_' and so on at a length which might make the most ardent monarchist tear off his culottes.  The assumption that the nation will mourn runs through all the mainstream media's pre-cooked packages. And if a handful of perverse dissenters don't wail, they will be after them just as they were after anyone who failed to exhibit the required trauma after the death of Diana Spencer.  The shape of things of come could be    glimpsed in the  News of the World last year when it shrieked at Camelot executives for 'hatching a tasteless plot to protect their Saturday draw if the Queen Mum should die that day'. Their decision to go ahead with the lottery draw and announce the results in the small hours when the grieving bulletins were over for the night was the 'the ultimate in bad taste'.  If the nation was grieving, everyone would be too distracted to buy a lottery ticket and Camelot could take the week off. Its emergency planning to please the punters shows that Camelot at least knows that national mourning is not what it was.  The great vulgarity of monarchy is its transformation of private life into propaganda. Births, weddings and funerals are used to build customer loyalty to 'The Firm'. Throughout the disasters of the 1990s, courtiers and royalist commentators consoled themselves with the thought that the death of the Queen Mother would pull indifferent or hostile subjects back into line behind her less than perfect family. Extravagant designs for her funeral have been knocking around Whitehall and the media for years in a classified document entitled 'Operation Lion'. Its authors envisage nine days of mourning culminating in the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. The monarchy would define the nation again and dominate its emotions.  Anthony Holden, the critical royal biographer, wonders whether Buckingham Palace still has the nerve to implement 'Operation Lion'. 'People will be making comparisons all the time with the numbers Diana's funeral attracted,' he told me. 'Suppose the majority paying their respect are elderly and there's scarcely a young face in sight. Suppose viewers revolt about television being disrupted for nine days. It could be embarrassing.'  Indeed it could. Politicians and advertisers are being forced to realise that millions of disillusioned consumers are blanking out their messages. The court and the courtier press should have learned by now that the old levers no longer work. The evidence for boredom with royal marketing has been accumulating for years.  The great exception everyone quotes is the death of the ex-Princess of Wales. I wouldn't deny it provoked mass inanity which compelled anyone who believed in the rationality of public life to grab   the nearest whisky bottle. But the scale of 'the grief' during those freaky days was exaggerated at the time and has been mythologised since.  The day before her funeral the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said he would need almost all his 27,000 officers to control an expected crowd of six million. Two million turned up. A year later on the anniversary of the Paris smash, tribute programmes got abysmal ratings and the failure of public hug fests to attract anything resembling a crowd, or even a huddle, forced the BBC to decide 'most seem to have decided to do their mourning in private'.  This was too lame, even for the BBC. Its managers drew a realistic conclusion. They decided not enough viewers wanted to see the pageant for the Queen Mother's one-hundredth birthday and became the object one of the  Daily    Mail 's hate campaigns. ITV took over, and the BBC grovelled and admitted it was wrong. The week's brutal viewing figures showed the error was on ITV's side. Its Queen Mother special was a lamentable twenty-fifth in the ratings, behind  Charlie's Garden Army and a repeat of  It'll Be Alright on the Night (VIII) .  We reported last week that senior courtiers feared that next year's Golden Jubilee celebrations for Elizabeth II may be met by 'a wave of apathy' which could damage the monarchy, so they know something is wrong. What they don't appear to understand is why they're being swamped.  A small part of the explanation lies in distaste for the airbrushing of monarchy. Everything I've heard about the television obituaries, and everything I've seen in the Press Association files, suggests that the old line will be recycled that Queen Mother is above politics; have the skill 'to be wholly non-political in the present reign', as the  Telegraph said last week.  They must know this is drivel and she has the standard prejudices of an aristocrat of her generation. Woodrow Wyatt recorded in his diary of March 1986 the Queen Mother telling him that when the royal family are alone together they 'often drink a toast at the end of dinner to Mrs Thatcher. She adores Mrs Thatcher.'  She also adored P.W. Botha when he was President of South Africa, and thought the media and black Commonwealth was being beastly about the apartheid regime he managed. She was opposed to women priests, had suspicions of the French, a paradoxical hatred of the Germans and 'reservations' about Jews.  When she was Queen, she and George VI broke every constitutional propriety in their eagerness to support Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and oppose Winston Churchill. So great was their complicity that the Public Records Office refuses to release the papers covering the royal fondness for appeasing the Right in the Thirties until after the Queen Mother's death. They would cause 'substantial distress', apparently.  Perhaps they would, but in the long term greater and deserved distress is caused to the Windsors' reputation by the sycophancy and evasions of their supporters and the bullying of the millions who see no reason to share their stage-managed pain."

It must be hard to get things right, living perpetually in the public eye. But he could afford to be a lot more dudelike, without getting any less regal.","Prince Philip has done something unprecedented. He has denied, in the strongest possible terms, that he ever called Princess Di a trollop or a harlot in any of his letters to her. This is not very regal behaviour, entering into a media mudfight, but apparently his hands were tied - Prince William had given him an ultimatum, and we can all imagine how shattering that was (""Deny these words, or I'll never look at you shyly from beneath my bambi hair ever again!"" he probably said). Clearly, this kind of nonsense shouldn't detain us for a second, whether true or not. The facts of the matter are in no doubt - the people's princess was doing the nasty with someone other than her husband for some time before their separation. Therefore, to anyone capable of using words like ""trollop"" and ""harlot"" without laughing, that makes her a trollop. It may never be known whether Prince Philip said as much to her face, but since he gets such timeless joy from saying things like ""Gosh, you're very black, aren't you? How hilarious!"" to the faces of black people, it seems unlikely that he curbed himself in the face of the harlot. Anyway, in a case where one person's dead and the other one's cuckoo, it doesn't matter terribly who said what; it only matters that the extant one is behaving rather unusually.  Devout royal watchers will have noticed that Philip made the news twice at the weekend - the other time, it was a brief mention of the fact that he was spotted ostentatiously leashing his Labrador while out walking, in tacit reference to Princess Anne's recent fine under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Obviously, he was making some kind of humorous statement, here: Labradors are charmless hulks of goodwill, they'd never maul anyone.  Perhaps he was saying, ""You crazy members of the public, I suppose you'll want me to leash my Labrador next!"", or perhaps he was saying something else altogether. But the juxtaposition of the two stories does remind us that Princess Anne's case was also unprecedented.  She isn't the first royal to own a dangerous dog, and she isn't the first to cause needless harm to her subjects by failing to do something that anyone with half a brain would have done, but she's certainly the first to be successfully prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act. The Queen, normally a stickler for boring old precedent, also behaved somewhat innovatively during the trial of Paul Burrell. There's certainly no precedent in living memory for a queen to give evidence against herself in a case she really needn't have brought to court, if she'd known she was going to do that (I wonder if she can now prosecute herself for wasting her own time).  All families have to break with tradition at some point, but there is a problem when the royals do it. Not because we set higher standards for them than we do for each other, since we're all perfectly aware how only-human they are. No, it's because precedent is all they've got. Precedent is all that's standing between them and the rest of busted-flush aristocracy; more importantly, from their point of view, it's all that's standing between them and proper income tax.  It is an undisputed fact that nobody accords the royals any constitutional importance whatsoever. Of 101 Labour MPs questioned by BBC1's On the Record, 80% said the Queen should be stripped of all constitutional powers. These people are supposed to be in charge! Why don't they just put their votes where their views are? Because of convention. Why does Tony Blair waste all that time chatting to the Queen, when he has no intention of doing what she says, and she's not going to say anything anyway? Because that's how it's done. Why do we submit to being subjects rather than citizens? Because that's the way it's always been.  If you spend one minute examining their role in the context of logic, rather than tradition, you cannot see the point of them. Even the staunchest monarchists, pressed on this family's purpose, can only come up with one of two things. Either, it's a tourist attraction (which I'd contest - or, better still, offset by building another London Eye). Or, they ask, ""What do we put in their place?"" - well, what indeed? A freely elected president? A toothless but benign head of state? Some kittens?  It doesn't matter, so long as it's been given serious thought; so long as the final decision is reached in accordance with the principles of modern democracy; basically, so long as there is some idea behind it other than ""Let's do what we did last year.""  Now, I'm not necessarily advocating the overthrow of the royal family, since on this issue, more than any other, I feel profoundly indifferent. I merely suggest that they should be a lot more careful, the next time they're tempted to wade imperiously into an issue, thinking to halt our tabloid chattering with one absolute assertion or denial.  Every time they do something they've never done before, however tedious it is, they're clawing through their own safety nets. There may not be much dignity in silence, but there's always a chance we'll forget they're there."

But he could afford to be a lot more dudelike, without getting any less regal.","Spain has been as obsessed as we would have been - and as Denmark, Holland and Norway recently were. The security is suffocating; the speculation about the bride's dress endless; the interest overwhelming. Yesterday Crown Prince Felipe, scion of the Bourbons and heir to the Spanish throne, drove through the grid-locked streets of Madrid with his new ex-TV presenter wife in an open-topped but bullet proofed Rolls Royce. Glamorous young royals from Europe's 10 monarchies added to the fiesta. Royalty, banned by Franco for 40 years, could hardly be more secure.  If the guests felt they were on a royal wedding treadmill, they were careful not to show it; European monarchy has never had such sustained good PR, and European royals who once expected to go the way of the Russian Romanovs are blinking at their revival - and capitalising on every opportunity to drive home their new popularity.  Ten days ago Denmark's Crown Prince Frederick tied the knot with a Tasmanian lawyer, Mary Donaldson, whom the Danish media have turned into a Danish Princess Diana. Her dress, a dazzling combination of modernity and the medieval (according to Hello! magazine), made great pictures - but then so did the galaxy of gowns, diamonds and rubies at the wedding and parties beforehand. In a celebrity crazed culture, nobody does it better than European royalty  Europe's young royals are emerging as media superstars. Holland's Prince William-Alexander's marriage to Maxima Zorreguita a couple of year's back was another national extravaganza where Europe's monarchies again gathered to luxuriate in their newfound popularity. Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Greece all boast charismatic young princes and princesses as well.  Nor is the House of Windsor indifferent to what is happening. All Europe's royal families, for example, were represented at the Queen's Jubilee, and no European royal marriage is complete without a British representative; if the Queen enjoys an approval rating of 70 per cent, that is nothing beside her European cousins (she is directly related to most of them) whose approval ratings stand between 80 and 90 per cent. The Queen understands better than her fiercely euro-sceptic consort - and Britain's euro-sceptic press - that Princes William and Harry will do well to associate themselves with rising pro-royalty sentiment in Europe. European republicanism is waning, an eccentric creed out of tune with the popular mood.  At one level, European royalty is doing no more than surfing the cult of celebrity; Posh and Becks may get a lot of coverage in Madrid, but Felipe and Letizia are the real thing - and a lot less transient. They are a soap that will run and run, and worth a great deal of media investment. But there is a curious paradox about royalty in an era of democracy; it and its legitimacy only exist because the public allow them to - and if the public is ready to allow monarchy a revered place in the scheme of things, then democratic culture becomes a means of legitimising this least democratic institution of them all.  Nobody is more acutely aware of this paradox than European royalty; it seemed obvious after the war that the cull of monarchs that had happened under fascism and communism would continue. Democracies wouldn't murder their monarchial heads of state, but the consensus was that they would certainly do away with these representatives of aristocratic privilege who had won their status through birth rather than achievement or electoral mandate.  The only escape from extinction was for royalty to transform itself into an impartial representative of all the nation - an aim the Queen embraced in her famous speech in South Africa in 1947. There was still the problem that this representation would be performed by somebody born to it rather than elected, but what monarchy could offer was lifelong continuity and a personal embodiment of the national public interest.  The Queen has managed to pull off the feat she set herself nearly 60 years ago; but so in their different ways have the other European monarchies. Belgium's King Albert and Holland's Queen Beatrix have a direct constitutional role brokering governing coalitions; Sweden's King Carl Gustav and Denmark's Queen Margrethe have both spoken out against anti-immigrant nationalism, Carl Gustav insisting that monarchy can be 'an impartial and unifying symbol'; and Spain's King Juan Carlos famously undercut Spain's post-Franco military revolt and guaranteed parliamentary democracy. Europe's monarchs have made the transition from quintessential expressions of privilege to expressions of the public interest.  But that alone would not have been enough to secure their new favour. Two other deep currents are helping monarchy. The first is European integration. The further development of the European Union (even in Britain where polls report public recognition that we will one day be members of the euro) is understood to be a necessity, but is not greatly loved.  European processes may be rational and even democratic, but Queen Beatrix represents the House of Orange that founded the Dutch Republic and King Juan Carlos the Bourbons who have been Spain's monarchs for nearly as long. They are embedded in national cultures in a way that Brussels institutions can never be. As currencies are lost, national parliaments weakened and armies cut back, monarchs remain symbols of national unity. The young European royals wisely do not complain about the European constitution; it is their ally rather than a threat.  And there is a more ominous trend. We are so accustomed to the presumption that democracy works that we have become blinded to the re-emergence of pre-democratic values along with pre-democratic distribution of wealth. The European royals disporting themselves in Madrid this weekend may adopt a public posture of promoting the public interest, but they are the inheritors of staggering private wealth and privilege solely by virtue of their birth - and to which European society no longer objects.  Indeed European royalty helps legitimise the new inequality by being so ready to marry ordinary professionals - Letizia Ortiz was a TV presenter, Mary Donaldson a lawyer and Maxima Zorreguieta an economist - and lift them into the celebrity network. Weddings of Crown Princes to commoners have become a bit like Oscar celebrations, spectacles which are for the people's benefit, but which by the bye legitimise fabulous inequality of both wealth and opportunity.  But here is the rub. Whatever your reactions, this is an uniquely European phenomenon understandable only in European terms. European royalty stands and falls together. It was at risk collectively in the first half of the last century; it is on the rise collectively in the first half of this. It is inescapably part of the European landscape. Conservatives like to portray Britain as closer to the US than Europe, part of a dynamic 'Anglo-sphere'. They misdescribe reality. Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage."

To take pride in such a response is quirky - but if even the Queen has noticed, it must be true.","Spain has been as obsessed as we would have been - and as Denmark, Holland and Norway recently were. The security is suffocating; the speculation about the bride's dress endless; the interest overwhelming. Yesterday Crown Prince Felipe, scion of the Bourbons and heir to the Spanish throne, drove through the grid-locked streets of Madrid with his new ex-TV presenter wife in an open-topped but bullet proofed Rolls Royce. Glamorous young royals from Europe's 10 monarchies added to the fiesta. Royalty, banned by Franco for 40 years, could hardly be more secure.  If the guests felt they were on a royal wedding treadmill, they were careful not to show it; European monarchy has never had such sustained good PR, and European royals who once expected to go the way of the Russian Romanovs are blinking at their revival - and capitalising on every opportunity to drive home their new popularity.  Ten days ago Denmark's Crown Prince Frederick tied the knot with a Tasmanian lawyer, Mary Donaldson, whom the Danish media have turned into a Danish Princess Diana. Her dress, a dazzling combination of modernity and the medieval (according to Hello! magazine), made great pictures - but then so did the galaxy of gowns, diamonds and rubies at the wedding and parties beforehand. In a celebrity crazed culture, nobody does it better than European royalty  Europe's young royals are emerging as media superstars. Holland's Prince William-Alexander's marriage to Maxima Zorreguita a couple of year's back was another national extravaganza where Europe's monarchies again gathered to luxuriate in their newfound popularity. Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Greece all boast charismatic young princes and princesses as well.  Nor is the House of Windsor indifferent to what is happening. All Europe's royal families, for example, were represented at the Queen's Jubilee, and no European royal marriage is complete without a British representative; if the Queen enjoys an approval rating of 70 per cent, that is nothing beside her European cousins (she is directly related to most of them) whose approval ratings stand between 80 and 90 per cent. The Queen understands better than her fiercely euro-sceptic consort - and Britain's euro-sceptic press - that Princes William and Harry will do well to associate themselves with rising pro-royalty sentiment in Europe. European republicanism is waning, an eccentric creed out of tune with the popular mood.  At one level, European royalty is doing no more than surfing the cult of celebrity; Posh and Becks may get a lot of coverage in Madrid, but Felipe and Letizia are the real thing - and a lot less transient. They are a soap that will run and run, and worth a great deal of media investment. But there is a curious paradox about royalty in an era of democracy; it and its legitimacy only exist because the public allow them to - and if the public is ready to allow monarchy a revered place in the scheme of things, then democratic culture becomes a means of legitimising this least democratic institution of them all.  Nobody is more acutely aware of this paradox than European royalty; it seemed obvious after the war that the cull of monarchs that had happened under fascism and communism would continue. Democracies wouldn't murder their monarchial heads of state, but the consensus was that they would certainly do away with these representatives of aristocratic privilege who had won their status through birth rather than achievement or electoral mandate.  The only escape from extinction was for royalty to transform itself into an impartial representative of all the nation - an aim the Queen embraced in her famous speech in South Africa in 1947. There was still the problem that this representation would be performed by somebody born to it rather than elected, but what monarchy could offer was lifelong continuity and a personal embodiment of the national public interest.  The Queen has managed to pull off the feat she set herself nearly 60 years ago; but so in their different ways have the other European monarchies. Belgium's King Albert and Holland's Queen Beatrix have a direct constitutional role brokering governing coalitions; Sweden's King Carl Gustav and Denmark's Queen Margrethe have both spoken out against anti-immigrant nationalism, Carl Gustav insisting that monarchy can be 'an impartial and unifying symbol'; and Spain's King Juan Carlos famously undercut Spain's post-Franco military revolt and guaranteed parliamentary democracy. Europe's monarchs have made the transition from quintessential expressions of privilege to expressions of the public interest.  But that alone would not have been enough to secure their new favour. Two other deep currents are helping monarchy. The first is European integration. The further development of the European Union (even in Britain where polls report public recognition that we will one day be members of the euro) is understood to be a necessity, but is not greatly loved.  European processes may be rational and even democratic, but Queen Beatrix represents the House of Orange that founded the Dutch Republic and King Juan Carlos the Bourbons who have been Spain's monarchs for nearly as long. They are embedded in national cultures in a way that Brussels institutions can never be. As currencies are lost, national parliaments weakened and armies cut back, monarchs remain symbols of national unity. The young European royals wisely do not complain about the European constitution; it is their ally rather than a threat.  And there is a more ominous trend. We are so accustomed to the presumption that democracy works that we have become blinded to the re-emergence of pre-democratic values along with pre-democratic distribution of wealth. The European royals disporting themselves in Madrid this weekend may adopt a public posture of promoting the public interest, but they are the inheritors of staggering private wealth and privilege solely by virtue of their birth - and to which European society no longer objects.  Indeed European royalty helps legitimise the new inequality by being so ready to marry ordinary professionals - Letizia Ortiz was a TV presenter, Mary Donaldson a lawyer and Maxima Zorreguieta an economist - and lift them into the celebrity network. Weddings of Crown Princes to commoners have become a bit like Oscar celebrations, spectacles which are for the people's benefit, but which by the bye legitimise fabulous inequality of both wealth and opportunity.  But here is the rub. Whatever your reactions, this is an uniquely European phenomenon understandable only in European terms. European royalty stands and falls together. It was at risk collectively in the first half of the last century; it is on the rise collectively in the first half of this. It is inescapably part of the European landscape. Conservatives like to portray Britain as closer to the US than Europe, part of a dynamic 'Anglo-sphere'. They misdescribe reality. Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage."
1,"Thursday. A man moves through a tube station. His CCTV image suggests a handbag-snatcher, but this thief's alleged haul of choice is human lives. A bombing mission has ended in failure or, as politically correct teachers are now being urged to say, deferred success. The attackers are planning to come back. The capital's biggest manhunt is on. Police seeking four would-be assassins shoot dead a man running for a train. Suddenly, shoppers, children and commuters are actors in a Tom Clancy fantasy that has usurped the lives of a city and its inhabitants. It is hard to pin a single mood on seven million people, so the media have two labels: fear or defiance. Neither sounds right to me. Tube passengers who smelled smoke and heard a detonator crack were as panic-stricken as anyone staring at their potential death would be. Parents whose children were on an end-of-term outing felt anxious. Office workers facing another long walk home flicked between reports of the attempted bombings and the Test match. At the National Theatre, a slightly depleted audience watched Henry IV Part Two and heard Prince John berating the rebels of Yorkshire for fomenting religious war 'under the counterfeited zeal of God'. It sounded like a rerun of the television news. Though Thursday's attacks on London do not suggest a war, the warped panache of copycat assailants striking exactly 14 days after the bombings that killed 56 marks a macabre shift. Once may be an aberration; twice is a campaign that crushes soothing myths. Even after 7 July, terrorists were credited with a modest wishlist. A city brought to a halt, a slump in trade, pervasive worry. All these sacrificial offerings might slake a predator's desires. But the attackers were never going to be sated by long delays on the Metropolitan Line or a bad sales day at BhS. Nor did they hope to see the fear of innocents corrode into an echo of their own mistrust, xenophobia and hate. Instead, they wanted blood and sorrow in greater quantities than anyone had dreamed.  No wonder carrying on as normal sounds more hollow, given the unfolding horrors in London and now Egypt. Normality, the buzzword of politicians who live abnormal lives, is really a pseudonym for necessity. People take the Tube because they have to, not because they think the negligible but rising risk that they might never emerge alive must be sublimated to national morale. And so we set off, bolstered by hope or superstition. Avoiding the rear upper deck of buses, the bombers' seats, is usual now. It is a game we play, like children never stepping on the cracks between paving stones, for fear of being eaten by a lion.  Meanwhile, the authorities are not carrying on at all as normal. Chief constables want powers to hold suspects for three months without charge. Shooting to kill may have been officers' only option last Thursday, but, suddenly, today's south London and yesterday's south Armagh seem not so very far apart. Of police chiefs' 11 new demands, many are sensible. Using the internet to plan terrorism should be illegal, setting up a specialist border security agency is a good idea, and admitting phone-tap evidence in court is long overdue. Holding suspects for three months without charge is another matter. That penalty, the equivalent of a six-month jail sentence, would be swiftly overturned by the European Court of Human Rights. The current limit of 14 days has been in force only since 2000, when its inclusion in the Terrorism Act suggested it was the maximum time the court would wear. Civil liberties are not the only reason to be wary. Recent eulogies to Ted Heath did not dwell on his disastrous decision to allow internment without trial in Northern Ireland, despite a warning from the army that it would bolster support for the IRA. Though there is no community to idolise a Muslim variant of Bobby Sands, there is plenty of discontent to coalesce round manufactured martyrs. How great is the threat? The second bombings destroyed any idea that the murderers of 7 July were, like horsemen of the apocalypse, a one-off quartet. Other assumptions are being demolished fast. Perhaps shadowy monsters from Islamabad are brainwashing our young men, as politicians would like to think, but it is time to explore whether Britons are the proactive ones, shopping the world for mentors who can alchemise their loathing into bombs. It is time, too, to drop the pretence of easy solutions. Expecting moderate leaders and imams to solve the problem alone may not be much more plausible than thinking Harold Shipman could have been dissuaded from murdering old ladies by a homily from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a climate of denial and futile hopes, people have had enough of being told whether they should be afraid or stoical. They want a way forward that will spare them the necessity of being either. First, what not to do.  Campaigning, as the Sun did, to ban Tariq Ramadan is barmy, since progressive Muslim scholars are exactly what Britain needs. Arguing, as ministers do, that Iraq has nothing to do with our vulnerability is absurd. If the coalition had secured Afghanistan and pursued known terrorists rather than launching a sideshow in Iraq, then many nations would be safer today. Instead, the war nurtured old assailants and bred new ones. But the time for what-ifs is long gone. The lesson for a nation mourning 52 people slaughtered by bombers is to remember that Iraq's civilian death toll stands at almost 25,000.

Extra security and resources for policing might help. So will the Home Office's calm responses, as opposed to the more excitable tendencies of Downing Street. Citizens, as always, will turn the unthinkable into a low-level irritant, not because they are the stormtroops of resistance but because there is no other way to live. But carrying on as normal does not just imply swaying into work on crowded buses, or bringing parties of children into mainline stations for summer outings to museums. It does not only mean getting back to reading Dan Brown on the tube, rather than counting bomb-sized rucksacks. Being normal means being free. And that, in turn, involves ensuring that the laws and principles which enshrine liberty are not overturned in the months to come. Freedom, unless it gets squandered in the name of fear or defiance, will endure long after this fragile, rootless hate campaign has burned itself to ashes.","Like many bridegrooms, Prince Charles spent the run-up to his wedding in male company, saying things he might regret the next day. But, far from being a stag party, this was the sober annual ritual in which the prince and his two sons break their winter holiday in Klosters to take questions from the media. Through welded teeth, Charles offered his squeak of anger at his interlocutors and, in particular, the BBC's royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell. 'Bloody people,' he said. 'I can't bear that man. I mean, he is so awful. He really is.' The media took a largely dim view. There was much commentary about the gaffes of a spoilt and petulant prince, and Mr Witchell reported the affair as gravely as if the heir to the throne had commissioned a Swiss stripogram, or proposed parcelling his mother and her corgis off on a one-way ticket to the Sunshine Rest Home for the Elderly, Skegness. Most viewers watching the prince's outburst would have taken a less astringent view, for several reasons.  Mr Witchell, apparently known as the 'Poison Carrot' at work because of the acerbic nature of his postbag, does not hold national treasure status. The prince, with his arms round his sons, cut a lonely but protective figure. There was a demotic element to his rant against the high-flown BBC, just after William had apparently confided his own wedding plans, or lack of them, to the  Sun. And besides, it was all oddly hilarious. But not to Charles, who could not, in the end, endure a saccharine encounter with representatives of media that, in his opinion, have reported his forthcoming marriage in a manner vile beyond belief.  'He loathes us,' says James Whitaker, a veteran of Klosters and the royal ratpack. 'He regards us all as scum. Although he's been able to bottle it up well, we got the true Charles in that moment.' Who, though, is the real Charles? Last week, he made headlines by losing his temper on the ski slopes. This week, he makes history when he and Camilla Parker Bowles, the divorced and 'non-negotiable' mistress whom he has loved for most of his life, marry on Friday at the sort of unpretentious register office that also does dog licences.  The Guildhall, Windsor, was chosen only because obtaining a licence for Windsor Castle would have allowed ordinary couples to marry there. But its prosaic setting is a perfect illustration of the contradictions that define the Prince of Wales. He is an austere eater who breakfasts off wheatgerm, lunches off dry bread and dines like the Emperor Nero, sometimes with a Spice Girl in attendance (he likes Geri Halliwell because she is 'so non-PC'). Charles is the social improver who grumbled, on hearing that a black secretary wanted promotion: 'What is wrong with everybody these days? Why do they all seem to think they are qualified to do things far beyond their technical capabilities?' He is the spartan who cannot travel without seven bedrooms for his vast retinue of staff, the narrow thinker who wants to be a Platonic philosopher king. He is, in his view, constantly misunderstood, and it makes him furious.  Long before Klosters, rage defined the Prince of Wales. Irascibility is hard-wired in his Hanoverian genes (or ingrained by his formal upbringing) and he is said to have inherited the 'gnashes' of his grandfather, George VI. The king used to kick furniture so hard that his hosts hid their antiques when he came to stay, replacing them with a prewar Ikea equivalent. When I visited his grandson at Highgrove, I watched him do it too. 'I have had to battle and battle and battle against a complete wall of opposition,' he said, and his oxblood loafer pulsed a drumbeat of frustration against the velvet sofa.  Sarah Bradford, the Queen's biographer, quotes a former servant's claims that Charles, in the stress of his failing marriage to Diana, wrenched a handbasin from a wall and wrote terse notes to staff: 'This sponge is dry. Please see that it is watered immediately.' On matters pertaining to areas outside his bathroom, he corresponds with ministers, urging them to bend policies on his key interests, such as farming, non-carbuncular architecture or science, to his wishes. Why should the Prince of Wales, a man with modest duties, an endless cash cow in the Duchy of Cornwall and an understanding partner, be so enraged, so pessimistic, so importunate? Why would he be so sad?  In part, because he has been fawned on too much by those who love him least. And, in part, because he is right in thinking that he has had a rough deal. At his worst, he is extravagant, intemperate and too receptive to bad advice. At his best, he is concerned, dutiful and engaging - traits largely invisible, especially as filtered through media that veer between presenting him as a joke figure, or, alternatively, as a callous solipsist who ruined the brief life of his virgin bride. To counter, or ignore, such portrayals would take a man of guile and toughness. The prince possesses neither attribute, and, with the exception of his best image-maker, Mark Bolland, has proved incapable even of buying in the only weapons beyond the reach of status or money.  Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor was marginalised from the start. As the fountains in Trafalgar Square ran blue to herald the birth of a male heir, his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, was playing squash with his mother's private secretary. The next day, in November 1948, Winston Churchill commended to the Commons a serene monarchy and 'a little prince, now born into this world of storm and strife'. The first part of the analysis was awry, the second accurate.  But the prince is a victim not of geopolitical or even national turmoil. The first of his two nemeses was a family that required him to behave like an infant courtier and sent him to Gordonstoun, the tough Scottish boarding school he detested, to iron out his 'weakness'. His second downfall was a modern media, whose prurience was never going to accommodate a prince who naively thought it was still all right, in the tradition of royal males, to have both a mistress and a wife. His first marriage was disastrous, his job condemns him to wait forever in the wings, and the press seeks, often shamelessly, to destroy him and install his older son in a post that Charles has trained for all his life and would do more reliably. It would be tempting to feel sorry for the Prince of Wales, were he not so saturated in self-pity.  But the fourth post-holder since the Prince Regent has not settled for victim status either. Instead, he has carved out a role, notably in setting up the Prince's Trust, that has helped thousands of disadvantaged young people. His genuine interest in, and understanding of, deprivation is not an example of noblesse oblige or social spin. For all his privilege, Charles, the outsider, knows how exclusion feels.  In other areas, the prince has been less successful. He has failed to curb his extravagance and been slow to investigate stories of bad behaviour within his household (including allegations of a male rape and the selling of unwanted gifts). But his real missed chance has been to neglect the necessity for reform. He has been too keen to intervene in politics, which are none of his business, and too hesitant - or more probably unwilling - to press the Queen and Prime Minister for an agenda for a modern, accountable and pared-down monarchy. The changes, at the start, could be incremental ones, such as repealing the Act of Settlement, which debars those outside the Protestant faith from reigning, and ending primogeniture.  Charles is not, however, a natural moderniser. A self-styled 'historian', he regards the past as a refuge from a present that he cannot comprehend and a future he mistrusts. His suits and kilts - even his Klosters ski-suit - have a museum cut, and his idea of Britain resides in an ancient dream. A re-bottler of genies, the prince looks out of his palace windows and surveys a world that is forever Middlemarch, only now with fewer foxhounds. Charles could have been little more than a man grown prematurely ancient in a Britain where, on his chronometer, time stands still. The events of this week will change all that.  By the greatest of ironies, a prince metaphorically wedded to the past will crush tradition in his second marriage. For a divorced heir to the throne to marry a middle-aged mother of two, herself divorced, in a simple civil ceremony boycotted by his mother would, until recently, have been unthinkable. For his bride, a jolly Gloucestershire matron with a voice that could trigger a Klosters avalanche, to become the next queen would once have seemed even weirder. But that, in law, if not in intent, is Camilla's destiny.  This wedding fulfils the dreams that a large part of the British population harbours, through sentimentalism or generosity, for its royals. Unlike the posh ceremonies with glass coaches and fairytale brides in too much silk, the conjoining of the Daily Star's 'two old gits' offers the most elusive quality in royal partnerships.  At last, Britain has a genuine royal romance. It has, in Charles, an heir to the throne who has finally contrived, if by accident, to put himself in touch with how real people live. It has, in Camilla, a woman who would be a perfectly serviceable queen, if the nation decides that it needs such a figurehead.  There is something here to engage most citizens, from diehard royalists to 'those bloody people' focusing long lenses on the slopes of Klosters. A king-in-waiting is marrying on Friday.

He could have had a career, made a name in his own right as uncle Linley has done, used the education bought for him at high price and the intelligence that came to him naturally. But instead he did the boring, banal thing. He chose what his younger brother - the one with the overworked elbow and dodgy A-level in art - had done only a few months ago. He opted for Sandhurst and a man's half-life in an army uniform.Thus the 23-year-old who would, sooner or later, be king faces a well-trodden few weeks of publicity. No beer, much relentless exercise. No sex or even trysts with Kate. Much yomping and early rising of the kind his dad remembers from Gordonstoun. It's routine publicity as the student prince turns to warrior prince for compact headline purposes. But it is also a dreadful waste of talent, another bumpy ride down the same rutted royal track.William, remember, is monarchy's last best hope: young, handsome, dashing, romantic. Most young voters, duly polled, would like him to be the next in line, the one who leaves his father alone in Highgrove to enjoy a leftover life of waiting in vain. Give us our media star asap!It won't happen, of course. Hereditary monarchies that start skipping generations for marketing's sake are signing their own death warrant. The Queen will not retire. She must go on and on. So, when his moment comes, must King Charles. And then, eventually, there is William.He will be 40 going on 50, or more. The David Cameron aura will have faded away, just like his hairline. Romance will have had its definitive day. This is James Hewitt territory with a twist of Charles Ingram added for millionaire luck. Mum always fancied chaps in uniform, we'll be told a hundred times. The throne, in extremis, will be saved or sunk by some ageing ex-Guards officer who relinquished a proper public profile for years when the barrack doors had closed behind him.The entire scenario reeks of defeat and disillusion. It is a very bad idea. Captain Willie Windsor won't live a life where reality bites. He will not - whatever blustering ex-colonels currently claim - be sent to Iraq or anywhere remotely dangerous. (Leave Harry as the only heir in town? You'd be cashiered first.) No, William will lead an active life for the cameras a suitable distance from any action. He will get promotion, but not too much of it. He will fill a recruiting slot. And then, in his middle or late 30s, he will be obliged to do what his father and uncle both did: that is, not very much, retired early, parked in the waiting room of monarchy.William, in sum, will become a killer of time and occasional cutter of ribbons. He can't be promoted too far, a runner of regiments, a power in the Ministry of Defence - because one fine day he'll be notional commander in chief of the whole damned show. He can rise so far but no further. He will be a lofty Guards officer who knows why lowlier guardsmen must keep their place. And then, like the Duke of York or papa for far too long, it will be more waving-and-shaking on Commonwealth circuits. Wills will be shopsoiled goods when his moment finally comes.Of course, the army (or navy or air force) has certain regal benefits for uncertain royals. Its entry requirements are benevolently enforced. It offers the company of other, suitably discreet fellow officers - and the hope that privacy can be protected once the mess bar is open. It provides a blameless, patriotic way of filling in a gap decade. But none of this is enough, not remotely enough. The army in its upper reaches is cut off from society, not fully part of the nation that must be ruled.Class distinctions and class pursuits still fill the pages of the Tatler. There's no way William can be a people's prince covered in braid as he gallops from polo ground to polo ground. There is no way he can keep in touch - or draw fulfilment from a job where the real rewards of danger and heroism are denied to him.He could have been so many things: a cartographer, using his geography degree; a schoolteacher, helping to shape young lives that would blossom as a legacy long after he'd left; a charity organiser, an Outward Bounder, a businessman learning to manage the Duchy estates in ways his father has never mastered. Even a journalist. He could, in short, have been useful - and signalled that his reign, at last, would be the start of something new, fresh and relevant.But no: the lack of inspiration and imagination is total, perhaps terminal.

I mean, he is so awful. He really is.' The media took a largely dim view. There was much commentary about the gaffes of a spoilt and petulant prince, and Mr Witchell reported the affair as gravely as if the heir to the throne had commissioned a Swiss stripogram, or proposed parcelling his mother and her corgis off on a one-way ticket to the Sunshine Rest Home for the Elderly, Skegness. Most viewers watching the prince's outburst would have taken a less astringent view, for several reasons.  Mr Witchell, apparently known as the 'Poison Carrot' at work because of the acerbic nature of his postbag, does not hold national treasure status. The prince, with his arms round his sons, cut a lonely but protective figure. There was a demotic element to his rant against the high-flown BBC, just after William had apparently confided his own wedding plans, or lack of them, to the  Sun. And besides, it was all oddly hilarious. But not to Charles, who could not, in the end, endure a saccharine encounter with representatives of media that, in his opinion, have reported his forthcoming marriage in a manner vile beyond belief.  'He loathes us,' says James Whitaker, a veteran of Klosters and the royal ratpack. 'He regards us all as scum. Although he's been able to bottle it up well, we got the true Charles in that moment.' Who, though, is the real Charles? Last week, he made headlines by losing his temper on the ski slopes. This week, he makes history when he and Camilla Parker Bowles, the divorced and 'non-negotiable' mistress whom he has loved for most of his life, marry on Friday at the sort of unpretentious register office that also does dog licences.  The Guildhall, Windsor, was chosen only because obtaining a licence for Windsor Castle would have allowed ordinary couples to marry there. But its prosaic setting is a perfect illustration of the contradictions that define the Prince of Wales. He is an austere eater who breakfasts off wheatgerm, lunches off dry bread and dines like the Emperor Nero, sometimes with a Spice Girl in attendance (he likes Geri Halliwell because she is 'so non-PC'). Charles is the social improver who grumbled, on hearing that a black secretary wanted promotion: 'What is wrong with everybody these days? Why do they all seem to think they are qualified to do things far beyond their technical capabilities?' He is the spartan who cannot travel without seven bedrooms for his vast retinue of staff, the narrow thinker who wants to be a Platonic philosopher king. He is, in his view, constantly misunderstood, and it makes him furious.  Long before Klosters, rage defined the Prince of Wales. Irascibility is hard-wired in his Hanoverian genes (or ingrained by his formal upbringing) and he is said to have inherited the 'gnashes' of his grandfather, George VI. The king used to kick furniture so hard that his hosts hid their antiques when he came to stay, replacing them with a prewar Ikea equivalent. When I visited his grandson at Highgrove, I watched him do it too. 'I have had to battle and battle and battle against a complete wall of opposition,' he said, and his oxblood loafer pulsed a drumbeat of frustration against the velvet sofa.  Sarah Bradford, the Queen's biographer, quotes a former servant's claims that Charles, in the stress of his failing marriage to Diana, wrenched a handbasin from a wall and wrote terse notes to staff: 'This sponge is dry. Please see that it is watered immediately.' On matters pertaining to areas outside his bathroom, he corresponds with ministers, urging them to bend policies on his key interests, such as farming, non-carbuncular architecture or science, to his wishes. Why should the Prince of Wales, a man with modest duties, an endless cash cow in the Duchy of Cornwall and an understanding partner, be so enraged, so pessimistic, so importunate? Why would he be so sad?  In part, because he has been fawned on too much by those who love him least. And, in part, because he is right in thinking that he has had a rough deal. At his worst, he is extravagant, intemperate and too receptive to bad advice. At his best, he is concerned, dutiful and engaging - traits largely invisible, especially as filtered through media that veer between presenting him as a joke figure, or, alternatively, as a callous solipsist who ruined the brief life of his virgin bride. To counter, or ignore, such portrayals would take a man of guile and toughness. The prince possesses neither attribute, and, with the exception of his best image-maker, Mark Bolland, has proved incapable even of buying in the only weapons beyond the reach of status or money.  Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor was marginalised from the start. As the fountains in Trafalgar Square ran blue to herald the birth of a male heir, his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, was playing squash with his mother's private secretary. The next day, in November 1948, Winston Churchill commended to the Commons a serene monarchy and 'a little prince, now born into this world of storm and strife'. The first part of the analysis was awry, the second accurate.  But the prince is a victim not of geopolitical or even national turmoil. The first of his two nemeses was a family that required him to behave like an infant courtier and sent him to Gordonstoun, the tough Scottish boarding school he detested, to iron out his 'weakness'. His second downfall was a modern media, whose prurience was never going to accommodate a prince who naively thought it was still all right, in the tradition of royal males, to have both a mistress and a wife. His first marriage was disastrous, his job condemns him to wait forever in the wings, and the press seeks, often shamelessly, to destroy him and install his older son in a post that Charles has trained for all his life and would do more reliably. It would be tempting to feel sorry for the Prince of Wales, were he not so saturated in self-pity.  But the fourth post-holder since the Prince Regent has not settled for victim status either. Instead, he has carved out a role, notably in setting up the Prince's Trust, that has helped thousands of disadvantaged young people. His genuine interest in, and understanding of, deprivation is not an example of noblesse oblige or social spin. For all his privilege, Charles, the outsider, knows how exclusion feels.  In other areas, the prince has been less successful. He has failed to curb his extravagance and been slow to investigate stories of bad behaviour within his household (including allegations of a male rape and the selling of unwanted gifts). But his real missed chance has been to neglect the necessity for reform. He has been too keen to intervene in politics, which are none of his business, and too hesitant - or more probably unwilling - to press the Queen and Prime Minister for an agenda for a modern, accountable and pared-down monarchy. The changes, at the start, could be incremental ones, such as repealing the Act of Settlement, which debars those outside the Protestant faith from reigning, and ending primogeniture.  Charles is not, however, a natural moderniser. A self-styled 'historian', he regards the past as a refuge from a present that he cannot comprehend and a future he mistrusts. His suits and kilts - even his Klosters ski-suit - have a museum cut, and his idea of Britain resides in an ancient dream. A re-bottler of genies, the prince looks out of his palace windows and surveys a world that is forever Middlemarch, only now with fewer foxhounds. Charles could have been little more than a man grown prematurely ancient in a Britain where, on his chronometer, time stands still. The events of this week will change all that.  By the greatest of ironies, a prince metaphorically wedded to the past will crush tradition in his second marriage. For a divorced heir to the throne to marry a middle-aged mother of two, herself divorced, in a simple civil ceremony boycotted by his mother would, until recently, have been unthinkable. For his bride, a jolly Gloucestershire matron with a voice that could trigger a Klosters avalanche, to become the next queen would once have seemed even weirder. But that, in law, if not in intent, is Camilla's destiny.  This wedding fulfils the dreams that a large part of the British population harbours, through sentimentalism or generosity, for its royals. Unlike the posh ceremonies with glass coaches and fairytale brides in too much silk, the conjoining of the Daily Star's 'two old gits' offers the most elusive quality in royal partnerships.  At last, Britain has a genuine royal romance. It has, in Charles, an heir to the throne who has finally contrived, if by accident, to put himself in touch with how real people live. It has, in Camilla, a woman who would be a perfectly serviceable queen, if the nation decides that it needs such a figurehead.  There is something here to engage most citizens, from diehard royalists to 'those bloody people' focusing long lenses on the slopes of Klosters. A king-in-waiting is marrying on Friday. Curse the monarchy, by all means, but wish him well.    <B>Prince Charles</B><BR><B>DoB:</B> 14 November, 1948<BR>  <B>Education:</B> Hill House school, West London; Cheam School, Berkshire; Gordonstoun; Timbertop, Australia; Trinity College, Cambridge; Aberystwyth University<BR>  <B>Status:</B> Single father-of-two<BR>  <B>Job:</B> None; heir to throne","As if it had not done enough apologising, the BBC has issued another  mea culpa. Stars of the  Beechgrove Potting Shed, a Radio Scotland phone-in gardening programme, had to say sorry after advising listeners how to propagate Amsterdam's favourite strain of cannabis. The presenters had thought the caller was talking about cabbages. It seems unlikely that the Dalkeith Dahlia Society would have been offended by this mix-up. Over on ITV, the bad language of John Lydon provoked only 100 complaints from among 10 million viewers. That figure suggests Britain is less shockable than America, where the national television watchdog denounced as 'crass and deplorable' Janet Jackson's decision to flash a breast during the Super Bowl. Although MTV viewers overcame their horror sufficiently to make the episode the most searched-for event in internet history, 9/11 included, the British can fairly claim to be less prudish.  The only curious thing is why anyone assumed that Mr Lydon's utterance of the words 'fucking cunts' would cause widespread offence. Equally robust language can be heard in Whitehall, where Sir Richard Mottram, formerly Stephen Byers's Permanent Secretary, was once reported to have regaled a colleague with a trail of expletives, concluding: 'I'm fucked. You're fucked. It's been the biggest cock-up ever, and we're all completely fucked.' Those of nervous disposition can only be grateful that Sir Richard was not involved in WMD damage limitation, or, for that matter, in eating raw fish eyes on primetime television.  As for Mr Lydon, his real use to moralists was to fuel the broader charge that  I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! has coarsened the national discourse and hastened social decay. This argument follows a familiar timeline, beginning with Chaucer, moving on to  Lady Chatterley's Lover and progressing to Jim Davidson and Pot Noodle ('the slag of snacks') via Roy Jenkins ('the father of the permissive society'). With the exception of unpleasant advertising campaigns, none of the above offers any evidence that the parameters of vulgarity are being pushed wider all the time.  The opposite is true.  I'm a Celebrity is the new variant seaside postcard, complete with improbably breasted women and, the departed Lydon apart, weedy men. As George Orwell wrote, Donald McGill's cards were intended as a 'skit on pornography' rather than the real thing. In the same way, Jordan and friends, emblems of British smut, signify repression rather than sexual licence. Those further horrified by the programme's sub-Attenborough respect for wildlife should also feel pleased. At least the contestants were eating the local fauna, rather than mating with it.  Viewers finding reality television shocking should stay away from Edward Albee's new play,  The Goat or Who is Sylvia? In the oddest, and most disturbing, production on the London stage, Jonathan Pryce plays a starry and happily married architect who, on the eve of his fiftieth birthday, falls in love with a bearded quadruped. Albee chose his mechanism for taboo-busting carefully. Though bestiality is hardly an alternative to the Tupperware party, it's at least more defensible than cannibalism, or paedophilia.  The recent Sexual Offences Bill took only a modestly dim view, pronouncing that 'sexual activity with animals is generally recognised to be profoundly disturbed behaviour' and introducing a maximum two-year sentence. While it is true that the average citizen would rather be cast away on a desert island with Lord Brocket than even contemplate such revolting conduct, apologists for what is more politely called zoophilia attempt to rationalise their preference.   Consent is not an issue, they argue. Nor is it impossible that a compliant herbivore would rather be wined and dined by a nicely mannered architect than finish up as goat stew. With the notable exception of Jeffrey Dahmer, crimes against humans are not linked to bestiality. The practice, commonplace among Greek Gods, is also popular with bored American rural workers. According to the Kinsey Report, around 50 per cent have cruised for livestock, as opposed to 8 per cent of the general male population. Such figures, though hardly plausible, have prompted trend-spotters to declare bestiality almost as mainstream as  Blind Date.  Albee's point is different. His goat is a metaphor for all illicit dreams, desires and compulsions that strain the liberal understanding, and his purpose is to explore the limits of tolerable behaviour. We are all, in the message of his bloody conclusion, self-appointed moralists prone to tip over into intolerance when old certainties collapse. The Broadway critics were not all kind. Some of his audience, adopting the John Lydon strategy, walked out, repelled both by the goat and a secondary hint of gay incest. Though London reviewers rave about the play, the Almeida theatre auditorium empties silently at the end. Albee has rediscovered something increasingly absent from modern Western societies. It is the ability to appal.  That realisation is, in itself, a shock to those primed to believe we live in perpetual outrage. If al-Qaeda is quiet, or Geoff Hoon-baiting palls, we can always be petrified by the state of Jennie Bond's hair. When the chief UN inspector hints that the nuclear-arms bazaar is beyond control, and politicians blow holes in the rule of law, there is something consoling about a grandfatherly Sex Pistol mouthing playground swearwords through snaggle teeth. Revolt and anarchy are fine, as long as they involve no problem   that cannot be solved by Ant and Dec.  Anaesthetised to horror, we have become afraid to confront any of society's demons, or our own. Are we prejudiced? Obviously not, though somehow, as a report on the death of a black schizophrenic, David Bennett, will illustrate this week, the NHS may be racist to its heart. Lacking in compassion? Clearly not, despite this newspaper's report on the exponential rise in women prisoners, with the consequent tragedies of motherless children and suicides.  Intolerant? Multiculturalism rules, yet somehow 19 Chinese nationals drowned cockle-gathering on a Lancashire beach, in the same week that fear of eastern European 'gypsies' eclipsed Britain's need for incoming workers and its duty to offer them welcome and the means to go to work and come home alive. Homophobic? The suggestion is insulting, but the fact that the 2001 census has exposed a swath of Yorkshire, from Redcar to Hartlepool, as a gay-free zone suggests some glitch, of integration or disclosure. Even if the fault lay only in the coy phrasing of the question, Massachusetts sounds bolder. Its Supreme Court, in insisting that the state legislature must grant full marriage rights to gay couples, last week edged a conservative nation towards constitutional crisis.  Britain, less polarised, steers a middle course between tolerance and oppression, without ever quite knowing where to draw the line. In that confusion, the debate on whether society grows crueller and cruder centres on trivia. FCUK posters and Gucci adverts with the double G logo clipped from a model's pubic hair are nasty, not corrupting. Those who add John Lydon, and reality television in general, to the list of influences corroding society are merely endorsing the perfection of their own values. Edward Albee would regard such certainty as perilous. His lesson is that prejudice can make fanatics of us all."
0,"Like many bridegrooms, Prince Charles spent the run-up to his wedding in male company, saying things he might regret the next day.

This is a classic New Labour document, being printed on glossy paper and illustrated with colour pictures of the Elysium which is the new Britain. Happy people, many from ethnic minorities, gaze productively at computer screens. Pensioners get off a gleaming streamlined tram which has just delivered them promptly and inexpensively to their grandchildren.  In New Labour's dream world, canals are for strolling by, past bustling pavement cafes where laughing groups of people drink cappuccino in the sun. And they're definitely not full of dead cats, condoms or rusted supermarket trollies.  The prose has the same unreal quality. Nothing actually happens, nothing tangible is planned. But, we are promised, there will be ""innovative developments"", ""local strategic partnerships"" and ""urban policy units"".  Town councils will have   ""new powers to promote wellbeing"". As members of society, people will need to be able ""to achieve their full potential"" while ""protecting the environment, both local and global."" To make sure this happens, the government's ""policies and programmes are the building blocks,"" and just in case we might think this may never happen, we're promised that ""visions for the future will be developed"".  There will be a ""key focus"" here and a ""coordinated effort"" there. The government, in its wisdom, has ""established a framework"". The whole thing resembles those fantastical architect's drawings, in which slim, well-dressed figures stroll across tree-festooned piazzas, with   no mention of empty burger boxes or gangs of glowering youths.  But Mr Prescott's statement, far from being the jumble of words we have come to expect, was an oral version of the same thing. I have noticed that the time to become suspicious about this government is when it breaks into capital letters. This invariably represents not the real world, but some new initiative, programme or quango.  He is setting up Regional Centres of Excellence. He has established a Neighbourhood Renewal Fund. He is considering an Urban Policy Board, and a Cabinet Committee is to hold an Urban Summit in the year 2002. Let's not forget the Integrated Transport   White Paper, the New Deal for Communities and the Social Exclusion Unit. Capital letters were all over the shop, each in charge of a resonant abstraction.  We hacks were abjured yesterday by Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press secretary to mark the difference between scepticism and cynicism. My attitude to Mr Prescott's statement was a balanced mixture of both.  At one point, for example, he reminded us that Lord Rogers had said, ""people make cities, but cities make citizens"". Tories giggled at this, crying ""wozzat mean?""  ""Think about it!"" he bellowed back, though I'm afraid I was none the wiser. You could say, ""people make   cars, but cars make drivers"", or ""people make alcohol, but alcohol makes alcoholics"".  This kind of talk spreads among the very people who use it. Mr Prescott got confused about the technical terms for a city. ""The city of York already is a city, as is my own city of Hull is a city, and that I think is the definition of city and town.""  Faced with these massive piles of abstract thought, there was little the Tory spokesman, Archie Norman could say or do. ""The only time we ever see the deputy prime minister,"" he grumped, ""is when he has a glossy brochure or a disaster to announce.""  Or, I reflected yesterday, possibly both at the same time."
1,"Highgrove is never going to look like the set of Shameless. Even so, the backdrop for Prince Harry's television interview was curious. Rather than picking some classless patch of organic curly kale or a ditch similar to the one in which the soldier-prince planned to spend his 21st birthday, the palace impresarios chose the estate's stableyard.In this equine Champney's, hunters deprived of their day job by the Blair government tossed coiffed heads over loosebox doors. You would not have been surprised to see a curricle full of Miss Bennets trundle across the burnished flagstones.It worked. Officer Cadet Darcy, with his supporting cast of point-to-pointers and poor black children from Lesotho, proved Harry's most successful image so far. But it would be unkind to mock someone who loves his parents, his step-mum, his brother, his girlfriend and his country, and who manages to introduce the word 'arse' so frequently into a formal conversation. If only his interviewers were so bold.Along with hiring and firing Prime Ministers and dissolving parliament, making people grovel is one of the residual powers of royalty. Normally robust questioners failed to follow up some interesting remarks and normally robust listeners failed to query the omission. Thus, the Today programme inquisitor did not explore Harry's line on why African children are so special ('Give them a tennis ball and they think it's Christmas') or seize on his hint that British children are less sweet.What tribe, exactly, was he thinking of? The undereducated, Asbo-breaching loser who ends up on remand in Feltham Young Offenders' Institution, devising six ways to kill himself with a bedsheet, or the polo-playing chavocrat who wears Nazi gear to a party and gets into a drunken brawl outside a nightclub?Still, Harry sounded OK and, besides, he was never the problem. The difficulty is the role for which he was born. The Daily Telegraph tested the theory that the office always justifies the occupant with its defence of the prince, at 21, becoming an automatic Counsellor of State, allowed jointly to preside over meetings of the Privy Council in the Queen's absence. The paper is partly right, though not for the reasons it supposes.Britain is daft enough to compel its Prime Minister and cabinet to take a 16-line oath of allegiance (often with fingers crossed) in order to sit on the committee that Henry VIII used to bypass parliament. So tough luck if the duty overseer has two lowish-grade A-levels and no obvious interest in matters constitutional, beyond how a dedicated smoker is to yomp round a Sandhurst assault course with a rucksack full of bricks.But even if Prince Harry were a complete ass', the paper says: 'He would be perfectly qualified, by his blood alone, to serve as a counsellor.' On the contrary, the link between rhesus positive and destiny is being stretched beyond its limits. A few months ago, the royals were doomed. The Camilla years had dawned and the media painted the Prince of Wales's new bride as Marie Antoinette in jodhpurs. According to one poll, fewer than a quarter of citizens approved of the union, and support for Charles as king sunk as low as 25 per cent.As with all royal upheavals, nothing much happened. Butler trials, dead princesses and household scandals only briefly disturb the grudging acceptance Britons accord the royals. Last week, as the Windsors got off what Harry would not call their backsides and began their autumn duties, it seemed like business as normal.Charles told Songs of Praise viewers how much he liked serenading Caithness seals with Scottish ballads. William became the patron of his mother's old charity, Centrepoint. The Duke of Edinburgh had a nasty moment when it was wrongly reported that his name was to be dropped from the famous award for young people, on the grounds that ethnic minorities and poor youngsters are oddly uninspired by a posh octogenarian role model still spry enough to be rude to Johnny Foreigner.Other things are changing. Post-divorce, post-scandal and post-death, the monarchy has lost even the propulsion of its own bad publicity. Though the Buckingham Palace flag flew at half-mast after the London bombings and an ageing Queen issued her condolences, there was no real sense of a head of state tapped into the mind of a nation that had grieved so extravagantly for her dead mother and daughter-in-law.Conflict does odd things to monarchies. The British model, the one European great-power version to survive 1914-18, emerged as the icon of Ramsay MacDonald, not the last Labour Prime Minister to protect the established order and enjoy its perks.

But first, he should watch Harry's birthday broadcasts. A prince is growing up. So why can't we?","Thursday. A man moves through a tube station. His CCTV image suggests a handbag-snatcher, but this thief's alleged haul of choice is human lives. A bombing mission has ended in failure or, as politically correct teachers are now being urged to say, deferred success. The attackers are planning to come back. The capital's biggest manhunt is on. Police seeking four would-be assassins shoot dead a man running for a train. Suddenly, shoppers, children and commuters are actors in a Tom Clancy fantasy that has usurped the lives of a city and its inhabitants. It is hard to pin a single mood on seven million people, so the media have two labels: fear or defiance. Neither sounds right to me. Tube passengers who smelled smoke and heard a detonator crack were as panic-stricken as anyone staring at their potential death would be. Parents whose children were on an end-of-term outing felt anxious. Office workers facing another long walk home flicked between reports of the attempted bombings and the Test match. At the National Theatre, a slightly depleted audience watched Henry IV Part Two and heard Prince John berating the rebels of Yorkshire for fomenting religious war 'under the counterfeited zeal of God'. It sounded like a rerun of the television news. Though Thursday's attacks on London do not suggest a war, the warped panache of copycat assailants striking exactly 14 days after the bombings that killed 56 marks a macabre shift. Once may be an aberration; twice is a campaign that crushes soothing myths. Even after 7 July, terrorists were credited with a modest wishlist. A city brought to a halt, a slump in trade, pervasive worry. All these sacrificial offerings might slake a predator's desires. But the attackers were never going to be sated by long delays on the Metropolitan Line or a bad sales day at BhS. Nor did they hope to see the fear of innocents corrode into an echo of their own mistrust, xenophobia and hate. Instead, they wanted blood and sorrow in greater quantities than anyone had dreamed.  No wonder carrying on as normal sounds more hollow, given the unfolding horrors in London and now Egypt. Normality, the buzzword of politicians who live abnormal lives, is really a pseudonym for necessity. People take the Tube because they have to, not because they think the negligible but rising risk that they might never emerge alive must be sublimated to national morale. And so we set off, bolstered by hope or superstition. Avoiding the rear upper deck of buses, the bombers' seats, is usual now. It is a game we play, like children never stepping on the cracks between paving stones, for fear of being eaten by a lion.  Meanwhile, the authorities are not carrying on at all as normal. Chief constables want powers to hold suspects for three months without charge. Shooting to kill may have been officers' only option last Thursday, but, suddenly, today's south London and yesterday's south Armagh seem not so very far apart. Of police chiefs' 11 new demands, many are sensible. Using the internet to plan terrorism should be illegal, setting up a specialist border security agency is a good idea, and admitting phone-tap evidence in court is long overdue. Holding suspects for three months without charge is another matter. That penalty, the equivalent of a six-month jail sentence, would be swiftly overturned by the European Court of Human Rights. The current limit of 14 days has been in force only since 2000, when its inclusion in the Terrorism Act suggested it was the maximum time the court would wear. Civil liberties are not the only reason to be wary. Recent eulogies to Ted Heath did not dwell on his disastrous decision to allow internment without trial in Northern Ireland, despite a warning from the army that it would bolster support for the IRA. Though there is no community to idolise a Muslim variant of Bobby Sands, there is plenty of discontent to coalesce round manufactured martyrs. How great is the threat? The second bombings destroyed any idea that the murderers of 7 July were, like horsemen of the apocalypse, a one-off quartet. Other assumptions are being demolished fast. Perhaps shadowy monsters from Islamabad are brainwashing our young men, as politicians would like to think, but it is time to explore whether Britons are the proactive ones, shopping the world for mentors who can alchemise their loathing into bombs. It is time, too, to drop the pretence of easy solutions. Expecting moderate leaders and imams to solve the problem alone may not be much more plausible than thinking Harold Shipman could have been dissuaded from murdering old ladies by a homily from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a climate of denial and futile hopes, people have had enough of being told whether they should be afraid or stoical. They want a way forward that will spare them the necessity of being either. First, what not to do.  Campaigning, as the Sun did, to ban Tariq Ramadan is barmy, since progressive Muslim scholars are exactly what Britain needs. Arguing, as ministers do, that Iraq has nothing to do with our vulnerability is absurd. If the coalition had secured Afghanistan and pursued known terrorists rather than launching a sideshow in Iraq, then many nations would be safer today. Instead, the war nurtured old assailants and bred new ones. But the time for what-ifs is long gone. The lesson for a nation mourning 52 people slaughtered by bombers is to remember that Iraq's civilian death toll stands at almost 25,000. If terrorism unleashes human empathy, use it against the bloodshed in Baghdad as well as London. The presence of British troops may antagonise jihadis, but until there is evidence that their withdrawal would not provoke a bloodbath, we must stay. How can we protect ourselves? Reform an intelligence service so out of touch it might be staffed by Martians. Abolish the state's links with faith. Neither Christians nor Muslims can any longer afford the segregation imposed by an established church and 7,000 religious schools. Of the instant measures, none is magical. Extra security and resources for policing might help. So will the Home Office's calm responses, as opposed to the more excitable tendencies of Downing Street. Citizens, as always, will turn the unthinkable into a low-level irritant, not because they are the stormtroops of resistance but because there is no other way to live. But carrying on as normal does not just imply swaying into work on crowded buses, or bringing parties of children into mainline stations for summer outings to museums. It does not only mean getting back to reading Dan Brown on the tube, rather than counting bomb-sized rucksacks. Being normal means being free. And that, in turn, involves ensuring that the laws and principles which enshrine liberty are not overturned in the months to come. Freedom, unless it gets squandered in the name of fear or defiance, will endure long after this fragile, rootless hate campaign has burned itself to ashes."
0,"Highgrove is never going to look like the set of Shameless. Even so, the backdrop for Prince Harry's television interview was curious. Rather than picking some classless patch of organic curly kale or a ditch similar to the one in which the soldier-prince planned to spend his 21st birthday, the palace impresarios chose the estate's stableyard.In this equine Champney's, hunters deprived of their day job by the Blair government tossed coiffed heads over loosebox doors. You would not have been surprised to see a curricle full of Miss Bennets trundle across the burnished flagstones.It worked. Officer Cadet Darcy, with his supporting cast of point-to-pointers and poor black children from Lesotho, proved Harry's most successful image so far. But it would be unkind to mock someone who loves his parents, his step-mum, his brother, his girlfriend and his country, and who manages to introduce the word 'arse' so frequently into a formal conversation. If only his interviewers were so bold.Along with hiring and firing Prime Ministers and dissolving parliament, making people grovel is one of the residual powers of royalty. Normally robust questioners failed to follow up some interesting remarks and normally robust listeners failed to query the omission. Thus, the Today programme inquisitor did not explore Harry's line on why African children are so special ('Give them a tennis ball and they think it's Christmas') or seize on his hint that British children are less sweet.What tribe, exactly, was he thinking of? The undereducated, Asbo-breaching loser who ends up on remand in Feltham Young Offenders' Institution, devising six ways to kill himself with a bedsheet, or the polo-playing chavocrat who wears Nazi gear to a party and gets into a drunken brawl outside a nightclub?Still, Harry sounded OK and, besides, he was never the problem. The difficulty is the role for which he was born. The Daily Telegraph tested the theory that the office always justifies the occupant with its defence of the prince, at 21, becoming an automatic Counsellor of State, allowed jointly to preside over meetings of the Privy Council in the Queen's absence. The paper is partly right, though not for the reasons it supposes.Britain is daft enough to compel its Prime Minister and cabinet to take a 16-line oath of allegiance (often with fingers crossed) in order to sit on the committee that Henry VIII used to bypass parliament. So tough luck if the duty overseer has two lowish-grade A-levels and no obvious interest in matters constitutional, beyond how a dedicated smoker is to yomp round a Sandhurst assault course with a rucksack full of bricks.But even if Prince Harry were a complete ass', the paper says: 'He would be perfectly qualified, by his blood alone, to serve as a counsellor.' On the contrary, the link between rhesus positive and destiny is being stretched beyond its limits. A few months ago, the royals were doomed. The Camilla years had dawned and the media painted the Prince of Wales's new bride as Marie Antoinette in jodhpurs. According to one poll, fewer than a quarter of citizens approved of the union, and support for Charles as king sunk as low as 25 per cent.As with all royal upheavals, nothing much happened. Butler trials, dead princesses and household scandals only briefly disturb the grudging acceptance Britons accord the royals. Last week, as the Windsors got off what Harry would not call their backsides and began their autumn duties, it seemed like business as normal.Charles told Songs of Praise viewers how much he liked serenading Caithness seals with Scottish ballads. William became the patron of his mother's old charity, Centrepoint. The Duke of Edinburgh had a nasty moment when it was wrongly reported that his name was to be dropped from the famous award for young people, on the grounds that ethnic minorities and poor youngsters are oddly uninspired by a posh octogenarian role model still spry enough to be rude to Johnny Foreigner.Other things are changing. Post-divorce, post-scandal and post-death, the monarchy has lost even the propulsion of its own bad publicity. Though the Buckingham Palace flag flew at half-mast after the London bombings and an ageing Queen issued her condolences, there was no real sense of a head of state tapped into the mind of a nation that had grieved so extravagantly for her dead mother and daughter-in-law.Conflict does odd things to monarchies. The British model, the one European great-power version to survive 1914-18, emerged as the icon of Ramsay MacDonald, not the last Labour Prime Minister to protect the established order and enjoy its perks. The Second World War enabled the royals to look the East End in the face and set the stage for Diana's affinity with eel-pie Britain.If there is any niche for monarchy in an age of terror, it is not yet apparent. Scorned for his interest in Islam, Charles has combined his familiar dirge against modernity with flagrant raids on the nation's bank balance. Not long ago, it emerged that the &pound;336,000 annual Highgrove rent paid by the prince to the Duchy of Cornwall, which belongs to us, went straight back into his bank account.Behind their drawbridges, the Windsors look lonely.

But first, he should watch Harry's birthday broadcasts. A prince is growing up. So why can't we?","If the public, as Lord Justice Scott Baker declared this week, really does have ""concerns"" about the death of Princess Diana, it has a funny way of showing it. For all the ""groundless suspicion"" which, according to the judge, still exists in minds of many people, scarcely any of these haunted individuals turned up in court 73 at the Royal Courts of Justice this week, to have their anxieties officially allayed. To avoid disappointment, the courts had even laid on a special marquee, with a screen and rows of chairs. In the event, a two-man tent from Millets would have accommodated the spillover, with room to spare.Assuming it is not the fear that Prince Philip might demand their execution that keeps everyone away, it seems that Diana's death has become one of those odd subjects, like the likelihood of a November election, that is of consuming fascination to the media, even as it evokes, among the bulk of civilians, only a fathomless indifference. Where, the papers ask, did Henri Paul go in those crucial eight minutes? If we don't know now, after two official inquiries, we may well have to live with that mystery. Though of course we hope M Paul did not - as he certainly could have - use these missing minutes to ring the Duke of Edinburgh with the news that he was already pissed and about to get in the car.Meanwhile, as the Mail asked about a picture of Diana in a lift, ""What did her smile signify?"" That Diana liked going in lifts? Or did she really, as the Daily Mirror avers, have ""not a care in the world""? If the inquest finds that this was indeed the case, Tina Brown will certainly want to go back to her authoritative Diana Chronicles and adjust at least one word in her opening tour de force, an extended piece of Ritz hotel realite (""Diana was at the end of a chaotic night out, and her mood was sour""). And what about the surpassingly awful ""dis-moi oui"" ring? Was it a straightforward taste accident on the part of her lover, or, as some sources have hinted, a sinister plot by MI6 to make Dodi and Diana look vulgar?In reality, after three days of evidence (the jurors rested on the fourth, prior to next week's fact-finding trip to Paris) - the one, compelling mystery is that, following both a French inquiry and a British one, Mohamed Al Fayed should have prevailed on the authorities to recruit a judge, 12 jurors and an army of 30 lawyers, so they could all spend another six months, and an estimated &pound;10m, weighing up what Lord Justice Scott Baker likes to call the ""building blocks for the conspiracy to murder theory"".One important block, raised on day one, was whether Diana was pregnant. Put forward by Mr Fayed, the claim for pregnancy was apparently supported in the past. with the evidence consisting of a personal phone call to Mr Fayed, and a Sunday People picture of the Princess forgetting to hold her tummy in. Producing it for the court, the judge described as ""famous"" (in what is presumably an unconscious echo of Dylan's cadences) this ""photograph of Diana in a leopard print swimsuit"", before pointing out that it was taken before her relationship with al Fayed's son had begun. Thus, ""her physique"" - as he delicately put it, could have nothing to do with Dodi.None the less, the judge reassured the court that this seeming impossibility would be soberly investigated - ""the question of whether Diana was pregnant at the time of her death is one that will be explored"". So, too, will be the question of her embalming - a process held by Mr Fayed to be part of a conspiracy to conceal the secret pregnancy. So will the question of Diana's engagement to Dodi Fayed, which is also alleged by Mr Fayed, though, one gathers, by none of Diana's close friends.Now that they see the enormous consideration being extended to Mr Fayed and his theories about the murderous nature of Prince Philip, many amateur investigators must wish that they, too, had put some of their more ambitious conjectures before the court. Is there no plan, for example, to examine the popular theory that Diana planned to stage her own death, in order to withdraw from public life? It can hardly be more preposterous than allegations made by the late princess herself, according to the judge, when she told an astonished lawyer that the queen was about to abdicate, while she and Camilla were both to be ""put aside"". Lord Justice Scott Baker revealed that Lord Mishcon said that Diana told him that Camilla was not really Charles's lover, but a ""decoy"" for his real favourite, the nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. ""She had also,"" the judge went on to say, ""been told that Miss Legge-Bourke had been operated on for an abortion and that she (HRH) would shortly be in receipt of a certificate.""It is tempting, once you're in the conspiratorial frame of mind, to see the judge's patient rehearsal of this dreadful stuff as, if not actually subversive, his meaning way of emphasising the abject, tabloid-serving agenda of this inquest. Hopefully, Lord Justice Scott Baker can only bear to talk about Dodi's girlfriend, Kelly, and Diana's famous leopard-print bathers - dishing out the original snap, with the rest of the court papers, for closer inspection by the masses - because he believes that if this final Diana fest is what it takes to once and for all satisfy Mr Fayed, then it is his duty, as the fourth coroner on the case, to get the job done.This might also explain the absurd court commentary that accompanies every single frame of the videos from the Ritz hotel. ""The Princess of Wales is carrying Dodi Al Fayed's cigar box"", a policeman said, presumably in case someone were subsequently to allege it was a bomb, or a baby's coffin. ""Trevor Rees-Jones is looking at his phone and notebook."" Later, as Henri Paul goes through a revolving door, ""you will see him holding his cigarillo box in his hand"".If Mr Fayed refuses to withdraw his accusations without having his months in court, then maybe we really do have to hear, again, about the embalming and the ring, about Paul Burrell's fears and Prince Philip's letters - not to mention the hitherto unsuspected role of cigar boxes and abortion certificates in the life of our favourite princess. Then again, is Mr Fayed remotely likely to retreat, if Prince Philip turns out, on the balance of probabilities, not to be a ruthless killer? You can't help thinking that it might have simpler, and definitely cheaper, if our secret services had just added him to the hit list."
1,"As if it had not done enough apologising, the BBC has issued another  mea culpa. Stars of the  Beechgrove Potting Shed, a Radio Scotland phone-in gardening programme, had to say sorry after advising listeners how to propagate Amsterdam's favourite strain of cannabis. The presenters had thought the caller was talking about cabbages. It seems unlikely that the Dalkeith Dahlia Society would have been offended by this mix-up. Over on ITV, the bad language of John Lydon provoked only 100 complaints from among 10 million viewers. That figure suggests Britain is less shockable than America, where the national television watchdog denounced as 'crass and deplorable' Janet Jackson's decision to flash a breast during the Super Bowl. Although MTV viewers overcame their horror sufficiently to make the episode the most searched-for event in internet history, 9/11 included, the British can fairly claim to be less prudish.  The only curious thing is why anyone assumed that Mr Lydon's utterance of the words 'fucking cunts' would cause widespread offence. Equally robust language can be heard in Whitehall, where Sir Richard Mottram, formerly Stephen Byers's Permanent Secretary, was once reported to have regaled a colleague with a trail of expletives, concluding: 'I'm fucked. You're fucked. It's been the biggest cock-up ever, and we're all completely fucked.' Those of nervous disposition can only be grateful that Sir Richard was not involved in WMD damage limitation, or, for that matter, in eating raw fish eyes on primetime television.  As for Mr Lydon, his real use to moralists was to fuel the broader charge that  I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! has coarsened the national discourse and hastened social decay. This argument follows a familiar timeline, beginning with Chaucer, moving on to  Lady Chatterley's Lover and progressing to Jim Davidson and Pot Noodle ('the slag of snacks') via Roy Jenkins ('the father of the permissive society'). With the exception of unpleasant advertising campaigns, none of the above offers any evidence that the parameters of vulgarity are being pushed wider all the time.  The opposite is true.  I'm a Celebrity is the new variant seaside postcard, complete with improbably breasted women and, the departed Lydon apart, weedy men. As George Orwell wrote, Donald McGill's cards were intended as a 'skit on pornography' rather than the real thing. In the same way, Jordan and friends, emblems of British smut, signify repression rather than sexual licence. Those further horrified by the programme's sub-Attenborough respect for wildlife should also feel pleased. At least the contestants were eating the local fauna, rather than mating with it.  Viewers finding reality television shocking should stay away from Edward Albee's new play,  The Goat or Who is Sylvia? In the oddest, and most disturbing, production on the London stage, Jonathan Pryce plays a starry and happily married architect who, on the eve of his fiftieth birthday, falls in love with a bearded quadruped. Albee chose his mechanism for taboo-busting carefully. Though bestiality is hardly an alternative to the Tupperware party, it's at least more defensible than cannibalism, or paedophilia.  The recent Sexual Offences Bill took only a modestly dim view, pronouncing that 'sexual activity with animals is generally recognised to be profoundly disturbed behaviour' and introducing a maximum two-year sentence. While it is true that the average citizen would rather be cast away on a desert island with Lord Brocket than even contemplate such revolting conduct, apologists for what is more politely called zoophilia attempt to rationalise their preference.   Consent is not an issue, they argue. Nor is it impossible that a compliant herbivore would rather be wined and dined by a nicely mannered architect than finish up as goat stew. With the notable exception of Jeffrey Dahmer, crimes against humans are not linked to bestiality. The practice, commonplace among Greek Gods, is also popular with bored American rural workers. According to the Kinsey Report, around 50 per cent have cruised for livestock, as opposed to 8 per cent of the general male population. Such figures, though hardly plausible, have prompted trend-spotters to declare bestiality almost as mainstream as  Blind Date.  Albee's point is different. His goat is a metaphor for all illicit dreams, desires and compulsions that strain the liberal understanding, and his purpose is to explore the limits of tolerable behaviour. We are all, in the message of his bloody conclusion, self-appointed moralists prone to tip over into intolerance when old certainties collapse. The Broadway critics were not all kind. Some of his audience, adopting the John Lydon strategy, walked out, repelled both by the goat and a secondary hint of gay incest. Though London reviewers rave about the play, the Almeida theatre auditorium empties silently at the end. Albee has rediscovered something increasingly absent from modern Western societies. It is the ability to appal.  That realisation is, in itself, a shock to those primed to believe we live in perpetual outrage. If al-Qaeda is quiet, or Geoff Hoon-baiting palls, we can always be petrified by the state of Jennie Bond's hair. When the chief UN inspector hints that the nuclear-arms bazaar is beyond control, and politicians blow holes in the rule of law, there is something consoling about a grandfatherly Sex Pistol mouthing playground swearwords through snaggle teeth. Revolt and anarchy are fine, as long as they involve no problem   that cannot be solved by Ant and Dec.  Anaesthetised to horror, we have become afraid to confront any of society's demons, or our own. Are we prejudiced? Obviously not, though somehow, as a report on the death of a black schizophrenic, David Bennett, will illustrate this week, the NHS may be racist to its heart. Lacking in compassion? Clearly not, despite this newspaper's report on the exponential rise in women prisoners, with the consequent tragedies of motherless children and suicides.  Intolerant? Multiculturalism rules, yet somehow 19 Chinese nationals drowned cockle-gathering on a Lancashire beach, in the same week that fear of eastern European 'gypsies' eclipsed Britain's need for incoming workers and its duty to offer them welcome and the means to go to work and come home alive. Homophobic? The suggestion is insulting, but the fact that the 2001 census has exposed a swath of Yorkshire, from Redcar to Hartlepool, as a gay-free zone suggests some glitch, of integration or disclosure. Even if the fault lay only in the coy phrasing of the question, Massachusetts sounds bolder. Its Supreme Court, in insisting that the state legislature must grant full marriage rights to gay couples, last week edged a conservative nation towards constitutional crisis.  Britain, less polarised, steers a middle course between tolerance and oppression, without ever quite knowing where to draw the line. In that confusion, the debate on whether society grows crueller and cruder centres on trivia. FCUK posters and Gucci adverts with the double G logo clipped from a model's pubic hair are nasty, not corrupting. Those who add John Lydon, and reality television in general, to the list of influences corroding society are merely endorsing the perfection of their own values. Edward Albee would regard such certainty as perilous. His lesson is that prejudice can make fanatics of us all.","Highgrove is never going to look like the set of Shameless.

Last week's right-wing fury that the (relatively paltry) &pound;3 billion invested in SureStart had not instantly conjured baby Einsteins from sink estates illustrates the deep resistance to even trying to dismantle a class structure that sets ceilings, strangles hope and curtails lives.At its pinnacle is the royal family. Republicanism, like stem-cell cures, may still be far away, but any Prime Minister who wants greater equality can no longer shirk reform. Ending primogeniture and discrimination against non-Protestants, and making the Windsors financially accountable, should not be controversial issues.Tony Blair still seeks his legacy, so why not this? Forging a modern monarchy would delight Labour supporters, discomfit the Tories, become the foundation stone of a fairer society and even please a royal clan that knows what happens to dinosaurs in crowns. But first, he should watch Harry's birthday broadcasts. A prince is growing up. So why can't we?"
0,"As if it had not done enough apologising, the BBC has issued another  mea culpa. Stars of the  Beechgrove Potting Shed, a Radio Scotland phone-in gardening programme, had to say sorry after advising listeners how to propagate Amsterdam's favourite strain of cannabis. The presenters had thought the caller was talking about cabbages. It seems unlikely that the Dalkeith Dahlia Society would have been offended by this mix-up. Over on ITV, the bad language of John Lydon provoked only 100 complaints from among 10 million viewers. That figure suggests Britain is less shockable than America, where the national television watchdog denounced as 'crass and deplorable' Janet Jackson's decision to flash a breast during the Super Bowl. Although MTV viewers overcame their horror sufficiently to make the episode the most searched-for event in internet history, 9/11 included, the British can fairly claim to be less prudish.  The only curious thing is why anyone assumed that Mr Lydon's utterance of the words 'fucking cunts' would cause widespread offence. Equally robust language can be heard in Whitehall, where Sir Richard Mottram, formerly Stephen Byers's Permanent Secretary, was once reported to have regaled a colleague with a trail of expletives, concluding: 'I'm fucked. You're fucked. It's been the biggest cock-up ever, and we're all completely fucked.' Those of nervous disposition can only be grateful that Sir Richard was not involved in WMD damage limitation, or, for that matter, in eating raw fish eyes on primetime television.  As for Mr Lydon, his real use to moralists was to fuel the broader charge that  I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! has coarsened the national discourse and hastened social decay. This argument follows a familiar timeline, beginning with Chaucer, moving on to  Lady Chatterley's Lover and progressing to Jim Davidson and Pot Noodle ('the slag of snacks') via Roy Jenkins ('the father of the permissive society'). With the exception of unpleasant advertising campaigns, none of the above offers any evidence that the parameters of vulgarity are being pushed wider all the time.  The opposite is true.  I'm a Celebrity is the new variant seaside postcard, complete with improbably breasted women and, the departed Lydon apart, weedy men. As George Orwell wrote, Donald McGill's cards were intended as a 'skit on pornography' rather than the real thing. In the same way, Jordan and friends, emblems of British smut, signify repression rather than sexual licence. Those further horrified by the programme's sub-Attenborough respect for wildlife should also feel pleased. At least the contestants were eating the local fauna, rather than mating with it.  Viewers finding reality television shocking should stay away from Edward Albee's new play,  The Goat or Who is Sylvia? In the oddest, and most disturbing, production on the London stage, Jonathan Pryce plays a starry and happily married architect who, on the eve of his fiftieth birthday, falls in love with a bearded quadruped. Albee chose his mechanism for taboo-busting carefully. Though bestiality is hardly an alternative to the Tupperware party, it's at least more defensible than cannibalism, or paedophilia.  The recent Sexual Offences Bill took only a modestly dim view, pronouncing that 'sexual activity with animals is generally recognised to be profoundly disturbed behaviour' and introducing a maximum two-year sentence. While it is true that the average citizen would rather be cast away on a desert island with Lord Brocket than even contemplate such revolting conduct, apologists for what is more politely called zoophilia attempt to rationalise their preference.   Consent is not an issue, they argue. Nor is it impossible that a compliant herbivore would rather be wined and dined by a nicely mannered architect than finish up as goat stew. With the notable exception of Jeffrey Dahmer, crimes against humans are not linked to bestiality. The practice, commonplace among Greek Gods, is also popular with bored American rural workers. According to the Kinsey Report, around 50 per cent have cruised for livestock, as opposed to 8 per cent of the general male population. Such figures, though hardly plausible, have prompted trend-spotters to declare bestiality almost as mainstream as  Blind Date.  Albee's point is different. His goat is a metaphor for all illicit dreams, desires and compulsions that strain the liberal understanding, and his purpose is to explore the limits of tolerable behaviour. We are all, in the message of his bloody conclusion, self-appointed moralists prone to tip over into intolerance when old certainties collapse. The Broadway critics were not all kind. Some of his audience, adopting the John Lydon strategy, walked out, repelled both by the goat and a secondary hint of gay incest. Though London reviewers rave about the play, the Almeida theatre auditorium empties silently at the end. Albee has rediscovered something increasingly absent from modern Western societies. It is the ability to appal.  That realisation is, in itself, a shock to those primed to believe we live in perpetual outrage. If al-Qaeda is quiet, or Geoff Hoon-baiting palls, we can always be petrified by the state of Jennie Bond's hair. When the chief UN inspector hints that the nuclear-arms bazaar is beyond control, and politicians blow holes in the rule of law, there is something consoling about a grandfatherly Sex Pistol mouthing playground swearwords through snaggle teeth. Revolt and anarchy are fine, as long as they involve no problem   that cannot be solved by Ant and Dec.  Anaesthetised to horror, we have become afraid to confront any of society's demons, or our own. Are we prejudiced? Obviously not, though somehow, as a report on the death of a black schizophrenic, David Bennett, will illustrate this week, the NHS may be racist to its heart. Lacking in compassion? Clearly not, despite this newspaper's report on the exponential rise in women prisoners, with the consequent tragedies of motherless children and suicides.  Intolerant? Multiculturalism rules, yet somehow 19 Chinese nationals drowned cockle-gathering on a Lancashire beach, in the same week that fear of eastern European 'gypsies' eclipsed Britain's need for incoming workers and its duty to offer them welcome and the means to go to work and come home alive. Homophobic? The suggestion is insulting, but the fact that the 2001 census has exposed a swath of Yorkshire, from Redcar to Hartlepool, as a gay-free zone suggests some glitch, of integration or disclosure. Even if the fault lay only in the coy phrasing of the question, Massachusetts sounds bolder. Its Supreme Court, in insisting that the state legislature must grant full marriage rights to gay couples, last week edged a conservative nation towards constitutional crisis.  Britain, less polarised, steers a middle course between tolerance and oppression, without ever quite knowing where to draw the line. In that confusion, the debate on whether society grows crueller and cruder centres on trivia. FCUK posters and Gucci adverts with the double G logo clipped from a model's pubic hair are nasty, not corrupting. Those who add John Lydon, and reality television in general, to the list of influences corroding society are merely endorsing the perfection of their own values. Edward Albee would regard such certainty as perilous. His lesson is that prejudice can make fanatics of us all.","Spain has been as obsessed as we would have been - and as Denmark, Holland and Norway recently were. The security is suffocating; the speculation about the bride's dress endless; the interest overwhelming. Yesterday Crown Prince Felipe, scion of the Bourbons and heir to the Spanish throne, drove through the grid-locked streets of Madrid with his new ex-TV presenter wife in an open-topped but bullet proofed Rolls Royce. Glamorous young royals from Europe's 10 monarchies added to the fiesta. Royalty, banned by Franco for 40 years, could hardly be more secure.  If the guests felt they were on a royal wedding treadmill, they were careful not to show it; European monarchy has never had such sustained good PR, and European royals who once expected to go the way of the Russian Romanovs are blinking at their revival - and capitalising on every opportunity to drive home their new popularity.  Ten days ago Denmark's Crown Prince Frederick tied the knot with a Tasmanian lawyer, Mary Donaldson, whom the Danish media have turned into a Danish Princess Diana. Her dress, a dazzling combination of modernity and the medieval (according to Hello! magazine), made great pictures - but then so did the galaxy of gowns, diamonds and rubies at the wedding and parties beforehand. In a celebrity crazed culture, nobody does it better than European royalty  Europe's young royals are emerging as media superstars. Holland's Prince William-Alexander's marriage to Maxima Zorreguita a couple of year's back was another national extravaganza where Europe's monarchies again gathered to luxuriate in their newfound popularity. Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Greece all boast charismatic young princes and princesses as well.  Nor is the House of Windsor indifferent to what is happening. All Europe's royal families, for example, were represented at the Queen's Jubilee, and no European royal marriage is complete without a British representative; if the Queen enjoys an approval rating of 70 per cent, that is nothing beside her European cousins (she is directly related to most of them) whose approval ratings stand between 80 and 90 per cent. The Queen understands better than her fiercely euro-sceptic consort - and Britain's euro-sceptic press - that Princes William and Harry will do well to associate themselves with rising pro-royalty sentiment in Europe. European republicanism is waning, an eccentric creed out of tune with the popular mood.  At one level, European royalty is doing no more than surfing the cult of celebrity; Posh and Becks may get a lot of coverage in Madrid, but Felipe and Letizia are the real thing - and a lot less transient. They are a soap that will run and run, and worth a great deal of media investment. But there is a curious paradox about royalty in an era of democracy; it and its legitimacy only exist because the public allow them to - and if the public is ready to allow monarchy a revered place in the scheme of things, then democratic culture becomes a means of legitimising this least democratic institution of them all.  Nobody is more acutely aware of this paradox than European royalty; it seemed obvious after the war that the cull of monarchs that had happened under fascism and communism would continue. Democracies wouldn't murder their monarchial heads of state, but the consensus was that they would certainly do away with these representatives of aristocratic privilege who had won their status through birth rather than achievement or electoral mandate.  The only escape from extinction was for royalty to transform itself into an impartial representative of all the nation - an aim the Queen embraced in her famous speech in South Africa in 1947. There was still the problem that this representation would be performed by somebody born to it rather than elected, but what monarchy could offer was lifelong continuity and a personal embodiment of the national public interest.  The Queen has managed to pull off the feat she set herself nearly 60 years ago; but so in their different ways have the other European monarchies. Belgium's King Albert and Holland's Queen Beatrix have a direct constitutional role brokering governing coalitions; Sweden's King Carl Gustav and Denmark's Queen Margrethe have both spoken out against anti-immigrant nationalism, Carl Gustav insisting that monarchy can be 'an impartial and unifying symbol'; and Spain's King Juan Carlos famously undercut Spain's post-Franco military revolt and guaranteed parliamentary democracy. Europe's monarchs have made the transition from quintessential expressions of privilege to expressions of the public interest.  But that alone would not have been enough to secure their new favour. Two other deep currents are helping monarchy. The first is European integration. The further development of the European Union (even in Britain where polls report public recognition that we will one day be members of the euro) is understood to be a necessity, but is not greatly loved.  European processes may be rational and even democratic, but Queen Beatrix represents the House of Orange that founded the Dutch Republic and King Juan Carlos the Bourbons who have been Spain's monarchs for nearly as long. They are embedded in national cultures in a way that Brussels institutions can never be. As currencies are lost, national parliaments weakened and armies cut back, monarchs remain symbols of national unity. The young European royals wisely do not complain about the European constitution; it is their ally rather than a threat.  And there is a more ominous trend. We are so accustomed to the presumption that democracy works that we have become blinded to the re-emergence of pre-democratic values along with pre-democratic distribution of wealth. The European royals disporting themselves in Madrid this weekend may adopt a public posture of promoting the public interest, but they are the inheritors of staggering private wealth and privilege solely by virtue of their birth - and to which European society no longer objects.  Indeed European royalty helps legitimise the new inequality by being so ready to marry ordinary professionals - Letizia Ortiz was a TV presenter, Mary Donaldson a lawyer and Maxima Zorreguieta an economist - and lift them into the celebrity network. Weddings of Crown Princes to commoners have become a bit like Oscar celebrations, spectacles which are for the people's benefit, but which by the bye legitimise fabulous inequality of both wealth and opportunity.  But here is the rub. Whatever your reactions, this is an uniquely European phenomenon understandable only in European terms. European royalty stands and falls together. It was at risk collectively in the first half of the last century; it is on the rise collectively in the first half of this. It is inescapably part of the European landscape. Conservatives like to portray Britain as closer to the US than Europe, part of a dynamic 'Anglo-sphere'. They misdescribe reality. Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage."
1,"The monarchy begins 2004 on a reformist note. Florence, one of Princess Anne's English bull terriers, is to go into therapy after biting a maid. The Princess Royal, who will accompany her alter ego to discipline classes, has recognised that Florence may be sniffing at the fate meted out to the Romanovs and Bourbons. Death Row beckons. But for her status, the royal dog would already be as moribund as the Beagle space probe. Instead, she played a starring role in the end-of-year royal 'scandal,' which began with Pharos, the Queen's oldest corgi, being mauled to death at Sandringham. The culprit was initially named as one of Anne's other dogs, Dotty, whose previous attack on two small boys cycling in Windsor Great Park resulted in a modest £500 fine.  This time, an inquiry, which reminded one servant of a 'murder investigation', came up with evidence that a different miscreant had ignored the Orwellian sixth commandment that no animal shall kill another. Exhaustive internal questioning of the kind not undertaken when George Smith, a valet to the Prince of Wales, claimed he had been raped in his master's household, revealed the corgi-cruncher to be Florence.  The lucky verdict that the Princess Royal had two nasty dogs instead of one psychopath was shaken shortly afterwards when Florence savaged (or 'nipped', in Palace-speak) the knee of a housemaid called Ruby, who reportedly begged that the dog be spared. To wonder why this saga should have shuffled the Bam earthquake, the Parmalat dbacle and the seaweed detox diet off newspaper front pages is to miss the point.  Anyone wishing to understand the modern monarchy should study how it treats its pets. On the whole, rulers have always preferred dogs to subjects. The papillons loved by Marie Antoinette, the sacred Pekingese of the Chinese emperors and the spaniel discovered, by her executioner, in the skirts of the dead Mary, Queen of Scots, all underpin that taste. But even Victoria's habit of running her court along the lines of Rolf Harris's Animal Hospital cannot match the dog mania of her successors.  The Buckingham Palace corgi makes Caligula's horse look under-promoted. No visiting head of state or triumphant rugby player can enter Her Majesty's staterooms without being ankle deep in a writhing scrimmage of dogs which never defer to dignitaries. Elizabeth's biographer, Sarah Bradford, describes how one nervous bishop, baffled by the lunchtime feeding ritual, took a dog biscuit from a footman's salver and ate it. As Bradford notes, corgis are an inseparable part of the Queen's image.  The same goes for lesser royals and their pets. Where else can they find companions who never fawn or curtsy and whose filthy tempers mesh so neatly with their own? There is a point where this idiosyncrasy, or fetish, gets sinister. In another of the late-year furores, Professor Colin Blakemore, head of the Medical Research Council, was denied the knighthood accorded to his predecessors. The rejection is believed to be due to pressure from the Prince of Wales, who apparently had Blakemore banned from an official reception. Charles would not, he said, shake the hand of a vivisectionist. That refusal, if true, validates the loathsome criminals who threatened Blakemore's children, vandalised his home and posted him a letter bomb because he approved of using animals in experiments to save human life.  Anti-science meddling by an heir to the throne who presumably favours cats above sick children casts doubt on his wider judgment. Equally, the Princess Royal's loyalty to her horrible dogs sheds light on the contradiction between the charity patron who accomplished 293    engagements last year and the nit-picking employer who, according to the Mirror 's palace mole, called a diary clerk 'a fucking incompetent twat'. Clinging to dogs who savage little boys and housemaids' knees seems to settle the question.  The royal family has carte blanche to rip off the nation, but not to tear its flesh from its bones. The princess's bull terriers should therefore be put down forthwith. This, I know, is not a universally held view. The Windsor paradox is that a dynasty which treats its subjects loftily and its servants shoddily has a brilliant grasp of petshop populism. The monarchy, whose love of dangerous dogs makes it indistinguishable from thugs terrorising inner-city estates, is also plugged into a broader cult of animal worship.  Last week's news that chimpanzees in Uganda and Tanzania have recently killed eight children and torn the limbs off others provoked little outrage. The chimps' apologist, a conservation biologist, ascribed this dietary quirk to changes in their natural habitat. 'They are just trying to get by,' he explained.  In the British courts, a Mr and Mrs Musselwhite are suing Safeway, claiming that their dachshund, Muffin, suffered a slipped disc after jumping to retrieve an unsolicited supermarket flyer from the letterbox. In the semis of England, as in its palaces, pets matter. Fears that the atomised society might prompt Britain's seven million dog owners to opt for lower-maintenance animals, such as leaf-cutter ants, have proved unfounded.  Launching a range of luxury pet accessories just before Christmas, Warner Brothers announced that people who delay having children are 'spending the money on their dogs and cats instead'. Hence the demand for £900 satin dog coats studded with Swarovski crystals and diamond-encrusted platinum collars, costing £12,000.  This waste of money is as obscene as the dog mess befouling British pavements. It is also part of a dottiness, incomprehensible to responsible dog owners, that preserves Princess Anne and her obnoxious pets from being more widely labelled as menaces. Florence's 'think first' therapy may work, but last week's poor results from the Probation Service's £73 million pilot for human aggressors do not bode well.  If only the Windsors' taste for change and rehabilitation extended beyond the kennels, the country might really be better off. As the New Year begins, the Fabian Society is seeking to build on the recommendations of its monarchy commission. In a modest step, there are plans for a private members' Bill, introduced in the Lords with cross-party support, for abolishing male primogeniture, removing the religious bar on the heir marrying a Catholic and repeal of the Royal Marriages Act, under which the monarch must approve all unions.  Cabinet papers released last week revealed that Lord Kilmuir, the then Lord Chancellor, wished to abolish the Act in 1955, on the grounds that it was 'out of harmony with modern conditions'.  The Windsors, and the Government, are not yet for budging. Sex and butler scandals have done the royals no obvious harm, while the dog furore has enhanced the image of a bereaved queen. Even Anne may earn some kudos from Rotweiler vigilantes. Another, more widespread, current of opinion thinks the real scandal of the Windsor's winter holiday is that of an aimless, self-indulgent, over-rewarded clan, cooped up with their dysfunctional dogs in a publicly subsidised, privately owned palace, tax-exempt and used once a year.  To us, the prospect of Princess Anne and her dog attending a canine offenders institution is a symbol of hope for the coming year. Whether or not the Windsors realise it, the monarchy also faces the choice confronting Florence. Reform or die.","Thursday. A man moves through a tube station. His CCTV image suggests a handbag-snatcher, but this thief's alleged haul of choice is human lives. A bombing mission has ended in failure or, as politically correct teachers are now being urged to say, deferred success. The attackers are planning to come back. The capital's biggest manhunt is on. Police seeking four would-be assassins shoot dead a man running for a train. Suddenly, shoppers, children and commuters are actors in a Tom Clancy fantasy that has usurped the lives of a city and its inhabitants. It is hard to pin a single mood on seven million people, so the media have two labels: fear or defiance. Neither sounds right to me. Tube passengers who smelled smoke and heard a detonator crack were as panic-stricken as anyone staring at their potential death would be. Parents whose children were on an end-of-term outing felt anxious. Office workers facing another long walk home flicked between reports of the attempted bombings and the Test match. At the National Theatre, a slightly depleted audience watched Henry IV Part Two and heard Prince John berating the rebels of Yorkshire for fomenting religious war 'under the counterfeited zeal of God'. It sounded like a rerun of the television news. Though Thursday's attacks on London do not suggest a war, the warped panache of copycat assailants striking exactly 14 days after the bombings that killed 56 marks a macabre shift. Once may be an aberration; twice is a campaign that crushes soothing myths. Even after 7 July, terrorists were credited with a modest wishlist. A city brought to a halt, a slump in trade, pervasive worry. All these sacrificial offerings might slake a predator's desires. But the attackers were never going to be sated by long delays on the Metropolitan Line or a bad sales day at BhS. Nor did they hope to see the fear of innocents corrode into an echo of their own mistrust, xenophobia and hate. Instead, they wanted blood and sorrow in greater quantities than anyone had dreamed.  No wonder carrying on as normal sounds more hollow, given the unfolding horrors in London and now Egypt. Normality, the buzzword of politicians who live abnormal lives, is really a pseudonym for necessity. People take the Tube because they have to, not because they think the negligible but rising risk that they might never emerge alive must be sublimated to national morale. And so we set off, bolstered by hope or superstition. Avoiding the rear upper deck of buses, the bombers' seats, is usual now. It is a game we play, like children never stepping on the cracks between paving stones, for fear of being eaten by a lion.  Meanwhile, the authorities are not carrying on at all as normal. Chief constables want powers to hold suspects for three months without charge. Shooting to kill may have been officers' only option last Thursday, but, suddenly, today's south London and yesterday's south Armagh seem not so very far apart. Of police chiefs' 11 new demands, many are sensible. Using the internet to plan terrorism should be illegal, setting up a specialist border security agency is a good idea, and admitting phone-tap evidence in court is long overdue. Holding suspects for three months without charge is another matter. That penalty, the equivalent of a six-month jail sentence, would be swiftly overturned by the European Court of Human Rights. The current limit of 14 days has been in force only since 2000, when its inclusion in the Terrorism Act suggested it was the maximum time the court would wear. Civil liberties are not the only reason to be wary. Recent eulogies to Ted Heath did not dwell on his disastrous decision to allow internment without trial in Northern Ireland, despite a warning from the army that it would bolster support for the IRA. Though there is no community to idolise a Muslim variant of Bobby Sands, there is plenty of discontent to coalesce round manufactured martyrs. How great is the threat? The second bombings destroyed any idea that the murderers of 7 July were, like horsemen of the apocalypse, a one-off quartet. Other assumptions are being demolished fast. Perhaps shadowy monsters from Islamabad are brainwashing our young men, as politicians would like to think, but it is time to explore whether Britons are the proactive ones, shopping the world for mentors who can alchemise their loathing into bombs. It is time, too, to drop the pretence of easy solutions. Expecting moderate leaders and imams to solve the problem alone may not be much more plausible than thinking Harold Shipman could have been dissuaded from murdering old ladies by a homily from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a climate of denial and futile hopes, people have had enough of being told whether they should be afraid or stoical. They want a way forward that will spare them the necessity of being either. First, what not to do.  Campaigning, as the Sun did, to ban Tariq Ramadan is barmy, since progressive Muslim scholars are exactly what Britain needs. Arguing, as ministers do, that Iraq has nothing to do with our vulnerability is absurd. If the coalition had secured Afghanistan and pursued known terrorists rather than launching a sideshow in Iraq, then many nations would be safer today. Instead, the war nurtured old assailants and bred new ones. But the time for what-ifs is long gone. The lesson for a nation mourning 52 people slaughtered by bombers is to remember that Iraq's civilian death toll stands at almost 25,000. If terrorism unleashes human empathy, use it against the bloodshed in Baghdad as well as London. The presence of British troops may antagonise jihadis, but until there is evidence that their withdrawal would not provoke a bloodbath, we must stay. How can we protect ourselves? Reform an intelligence service so out of touch it might be staffed by Martians. Abolish the state's links with faith. Neither Christians nor Muslims can any longer afford the segregation imposed by an established church and 7,000 religious schools. Of the instant measures, none is magical. Extra security and resources for policing might help. So will the Home Office's calm responses, as opposed to the more excitable tendencies of Downing Street. Citizens, as always, will turn the unthinkable into a low-level irritant, not because they are the stormtroops of resistance but because there is no other way to live. But carrying on as normal does not just imply swaying into work on crowded buses, or bringing parties of children into mainline stations for summer outings to museums. It does not only mean getting back to reading Dan Brown on the tube, rather than counting bomb-sized rucksacks. Being normal means being free. And that, in turn, involves ensuring that the laws and principles which enshrine liberty are not overturned in the months to come. Freedom, unless it gets squandered in the name of fear or defiance, will endure long after this fragile, rootless hate campaign has burned itself to ashes."

Another, more widespread, current of opinion thinks the real scandal of the Windsor's winter holiday is that of an aimless, self-indulgent, over-rewarded clan, cooped up with their dysfunctional dogs in a publicly subsidised, privately owned palace, tax-exempt and used once a year.  To us, the prospect of Princess Anne and her dog attending a canine offenders institution is a symbol of hope for the coming year. Whether or not the Windsors realise it, the monarchy also faces the choice confronting Florence. Reform or die.","Spain has been as obsessed as we would have been - and as Denmark, Holland and Norway recently were. The security is suffocating; the speculation about the bride's dress endless; the interest overwhelming. Yesterday Crown Prince Felipe, scion of the Bourbons and heir to the Spanish throne, drove through the grid-locked streets of Madrid with his new ex-TV presenter wife in an open-topped but bullet proofed Rolls Royce. Glamorous young royals from Europe's 10 monarchies added to the fiesta. Royalty, banned by Franco for 40 years, could hardly be more secure.  If the guests felt they were on a royal wedding treadmill, they were careful not to show it; European monarchy has never had such sustained good PR, and European royals who once expected to go the way of the Russian Romanovs are blinking at their revival - and capitalising on every opportunity to drive home their new popularity.  Ten days ago Denmark's Crown Prince Frederick tied the knot with a Tasmanian lawyer, Mary Donaldson, whom the Danish media have turned into a Danish Princess Diana. Her dress, a dazzling combination of modernity and the medieval (according to Hello! magazine), made great pictures - but then so did the galaxy of gowns, diamonds and rubies at the wedding and parties beforehand. In a celebrity crazed culture, nobody does it better than European royalty  Europe's young royals are emerging as media superstars. Holland's Prince William-Alexander's marriage to Maxima Zorreguita a couple of year's back was another national extravaganza where Europe's monarchies again gathered to luxuriate in their newfound popularity. Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Greece all boast charismatic young princes and princesses as well.  Nor is the House of Windsor indifferent to what is happening. All Europe's royal families, for example, were represented at the Queen's Jubilee, and no European royal marriage is complete without a British representative; if the Queen enjoys an approval rating of 70 per cent, that is nothing beside her European cousins (she is directly related to most of them) whose approval ratings stand between 80 and 90 per cent. The Queen understands better than her fiercely euro-sceptic consort - and Britain's euro-sceptic press - that Princes William and Harry will do well to associate themselves with rising pro-royalty sentiment in Europe. European republicanism is waning, an eccentric creed out of tune with the popular mood.  At one level, European royalty is doing no more than surfing the cult of celebrity; Posh and Becks may get a lot of coverage in Madrid, but Felipe and Letizia are the real thing - and a lot less transient. They are a soap that will run and run, and worth a great deal of media investment. But there is a curious paradox about royalty in an era of democracy; it and its legitimacy only exist because the public allow them to - and if the public is ready to allow monarchy a revered place in the scheme of things, then democratic culture becomes a means of legitimising this least democratic institution of them all.  Nobody is more acutely aware of this paradox than European royalty; it seemed obvious after the war that the cull of monarchs that had happened under fascism and communism would continue. Democracies wouldn't murder their monarchial heads of state, but the consensus was that they would certainly do away with these representatives of aristocratic privilege who had won their status through birth rather than achievement or electoral mandate.  The only escape from extinction was for royalty to transform itself into an impartial representative of all the nation - an aim the Queen embraced in her famous speech in South Africa in 1947. There was still the problem that this representation would be performed by somebody born to it rather than elected, but what monarchy could offer was lifelong continuity and a personal embodiment of the national public interest.  The Queen has managed to pull off the feat she set herself nearly 60 years ago; but so in their different ways have the other European monarchies. Belgium's King Albert and Holland's Queen Beatrix have a direct constitutional role brokering governing coalitions; Sweden's King Carl Gustav and Denmark's Queen Margrethe have both spoken out against anti-immigrant nationalism, Carl Gustav insisting that monarchy can be 'an impartial and unifying symbol'; and Spain's King Juan Carlos famously undercut Spain's post-Franco military revolt and guaranteed parliamentary democracy. Europe's monarchs have made the transition from quintessential expressions of privilege to expressions of the public interest.  But that alone would not have been enough to secure their new favour. Two other deep currents are helping monarchy. The first is European integration. The further development of the European Union (even in Britain where polls report public recognition that we will one day be members of the euro) is understood to be a necessity, but is not greatly loved.  European processes may be rational and even democratic, but Queen Beatrix represents the House of Orange that founded the Dutch Republic and King Juan Carlos the Bourbons who have been Spain's monarchs for nearly as long. They are embedded in national cultures in a way that Brussels institutions can never be. As currencies are lost, national parliaments weakened and armies cut back, monarchs remain symbols of national unity. The young European royals wisely do not complain about the European constitution; it is their ally rather than a threat.  And there is a more ominous trend. We are so accustomed to the presumption that democracy works that we have become blinded to the re-emergence of pre-democratic values along with pre-democratic distribution of wealth. The European royals disporting themselves in Madrid this weekend may adopt a public posture of promoting the public interest, but they are the inheritors of staggering private wealth and privilege solely by virtue of their birth - and to which European society no longer objects.  Indeed European royalty helps legitimise the new inequality by being so ready to marry ordinary professionals - Letizia Ortiz was a TV presenter, Mary Donaldson a lawyer and Maxima Zorreguieta an economist - and lift them into the celebrity network. Weddings of Crown Princes to commoners have become a bit like Oscar celebrations, spectacles which are for the people's benefit, but which by the bye legitimise fabulous inequality of both wealth and opportunity.  But here is the rub. Whatever your reactions, this is an uniquely European phenomenon understandable only in European terms. European royalty stands and falls together. It was at risk collectively in the first half of the last century; it is on the rise collectively in the first half of this. It is inescapably part of the European landscape. Conservatives like to portray Britain as closer to the US than Europe, part of a dynamic 'Anglo-sphere'. They misdescribe reality. Britain and its monarchy are as European as a jewelled crown, an open-topped Rolls-Royce and popular joy at a royal marriage."
1,"Since the American showman David Blaine believes himself to be the new Houdini, it follows that he should, like his more gifted predecessor, have decided to bring his tricks to London. It was, says Ruth Brandon in her biography of Houdini, the reception of his manacle escapes on the London stage that confirmed his ""uttermost hopes and expectations"". Houdini became so famous here, she adds, that Lord Northcliffe, the newspaper proprietor, visited his dressing room, asking advice on various topical events. And who knows? If Blaine's new stunt - ""his toughest endurance feat yet"" - comes off, maybe our own newspaper proprietors will soon be seeking enlightenment from this most sapient of nappy wearers. At the time of writing, however, it seems unlikely. So far from confirming his uttermost hopes and expectations, Blaine's encounter with the British public appears to have been his first ever encounter with sustained derision. After two days in which the magician came under assault from fish and chips, eggs, golf balls, laser pens, wake-up calls from bhangra drums and women displaying their breasts, a spokesman for Sky television, which has bought the rights to this stunt, regretted that not everyone had been ""respectful to the challenge... unfortunately you will always get one or two thugs"". But the antics of these one or two had been enough to frighten Blaine's organisers into surrounding his crane-and-dangling-box arrangement with some untidy wire fencing. Now, with its profusion of electrical wires, tents and heavies, his ""Above the Below"" encampment below Tower Bridge looks about as edifying as the back end of a funfair.  Still, should you be looking for an agreeable picnic spot, I can think of no better place, just now, than below the above: the area of dusty, trodden-down prairie over which Blaine now languishes for a living. Not because the magician himself is much to look at. In a few weeks time, when he begins, like all ill-nourished down-and-outs to resemble someone who could be Lord Lucan, it might be different. For now, the visiting daredevil simply looks greasily out of sorts, podgy enough to last several weeks, and seems to share Tony Blair's lack of inhibition about yawning and picking at himself in public. No, the place is worth a detour not in order to admire Blaine, but to participate in an exhilarating act of collective ridicule. If you can take some food with you, so much the better. If not, I have discovered, even a blob of oily ice cream from the van tastes exquisite when consumed in the suspended company of the preposterous, faux-starving Blaine.  Improved security had done little, when I visited, to bring about the desired reverence for Blaine's very public diet. And the previous night's adulatory C4 documentary, in which the visitor proclaimed, ""I'm an artist, nothing more, nothing less,"" probably hadn't helped, even if it had attracted more people. Anyone who remembered Blaine's parting speculation about his chances - ""Will the air supply suddenly get cut off and cause suffocation... even death?"" - had only to look up to realise that the simple answer to this question, was, no, it wouldn't. You'd think he would have known that. Not with those two little windows.  The disparities between the advertised, and real event were such that you wondered if there could have been some kind of mistake. Weren't Tower Bridge and the Thames meant to be somehow involved, instead of just picturesquely adjacent? And on telly, a wide-eyed Nicky Campbell had referred repeatedly to ""solitary confinement"". Blaine had also stressed a desire for ""no distractions... I think that's the purest state you could be in... "" In practice, he has made his lit-up box the pinnacle of a non-stop party. Passing riverboats and vans tootle jolly hellos at him. Women wave. Spectators guffaw more or less in his face, shout at him to ""put the kettle on"", mime flying with their arms, threaten to come back with signs reading: ""Are you mental or what?"" When, laboriously, Blaine wraps a sheet round himself and makes as if to wee into a hidden tube, there are uproarious shouts of, ""He's having a piss!""; then, ""He can't still be having a piss""; then, ""No - he's wanking!""; then - after the business is seemingly complete - hearty cheers and applause.  Next, in his solitary confinement, Blaine takes up what we know, from Campbell's breathless tribute, to be ""his journal"". ""Day one,"" says a man behind me, ""Sat in a glass box."" ""Day two, still sitting in a glass box. Day three... ""  Paid observers inform us that after a while Blaine's body will begin a metabolic process known as ""ketosis"", in which, if I understand correctly, it eats itself for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A   year or so ago, this might have sounded quite awful and impressive. Alas for Blaine, one in 10 Britons have now learned from Dr Atkins that ketosis is in fact a ""wonderful process"" - that beatific stage of the slimming regime when the dieter begins to burn his own fat reserves, and so starts to become a lovelier, more streamlined person. Lucky Blaine! For different reasons, people who have been unable to eat because of advanced illness, and their relatives, may also find themselves indifferent to Blaine's agonies. If agonies they are. Though, being notably well covered, he seems unlikely to be as indifferent to food as Kafka's hunger artist, who never found any food that he liked, as Blaine's task is presumably made easier by the £5m he will earn from this episode of professional fasting.  Aside from micturate and attend to his journal, Blaine also waves for the cameras, turns over to show his tattoo, moves his sheet around, scratches his head and, from time to time, fills a water bottle from another tube. These actions are duly texted, photographed, reported and filmed on mobile phones - mostly redundant devices which seem almost to have been waiting for this still more redundant event in order to prove that they may, after all, occasionally serve a purpose: ""No, he's just sitting there, no, he hasn't moved, no, it's really funny... ""  This was not, you gathered from the Blaine programme, the intended response to ostentatious fasting, an act repeatedly introduced as ""his toughest endurance feat yet"". The crowd are supposed, like the American multitudes before them, to faint with anxiety, empathise through the long nights, discern some noble purpose in his supposed travails in the ice, up pillars, inside glass containers. Instead they watch, eat and cackle. To anyone who has recently felt downcast by popular displays of credulity and celebrity worship, this massed derision should come as a reassuring, even an inspiring, sight.  In fact, the prospect of Blaine at the mercy of a good humoured, but predominantly satirical crowd, composed of visitors of all ages, classes and ethnicities, hints at some residual, collective good sense, which can tell the difference between a huckster and a hero, and thus differentiates us from Americans. If Blaine could be induced to stay, for all time, in his silly box, there could be many worse ways of acquiring British nationality by composing some appropriate insult in the English tongue, then throwing an egg at him.","If the public, as Lord Justice Scott Baker declared this week, really does have ""concerns"" about the death of Princess Diana, it has a funny way of showing it. For all the ""groundless suspicion"" which, according to the judge, still exists in minds of many people, scarcely any of these haunted individuals turned up in court 73 at the Royal Courts of Justice this week, to have their anxieties officially allayed. To avoid disappointment, the courts had even laid on a special marquee, with a screen and rows of chairs. In the event, a two-man tent from Millets would have accommodated the spillover, with room to spare.Assuming it is not the fear that Prince Philip might demand their execution that keeps everyone away, it seems that Diana's death has become one of those odd subjects, like the likelihood of a November election, that is of consuming fascination to the media, even as it evokes, among the bulk of civilians, only a fathomless indifference. Where, the papers ask, did Henri Paul go in those crucial eight minutes? If we don't know now, after two official inquiries, we may well have to live with that mystery. Though of course we hope M Paul did not - as he certainly could have - use these missing minutes to ring the Duke of Edinburgh with the news that he was already pissed and about to get in the car.Meanwhile, as the Mail asked about a picture of Diana in a lift, ""What did her smile signify?"" That Diana liked going in lifts? Or did she really, as the Daily Mirror avers, have ""not a care in the world""? If the inquest finds that this was indeed the case, Tina Brown will certainly want to go back to her authoritative Diana Chronicles and adjust at least one word in her opening tour de force, an extended piece of Ritz hotel realite (""Diana was at the end of a chaotic night out, and her mood was sour""). And what about the surpassingly awful ""dis-moi oui"" ring? Was it a straightforward taste accident on the part of her lover, or, as some sources have hinted, a sinister plot by MI6 to make Dodi and Diana look vulgar?In reality, after three days of evidence (the jurors rested on the fourth, prior to next week's fact-finding trip to Paris) - the one, compelling mystery is that, following both a French inquiry and a British one, Mohamed Al Fayed should have prevailed on the authorities to recruit a judge, 12 jurors and an army of 30 lawyers, so they could all spend another six months, and an estimated &pound;10m, weighing up what Lord Justice Scott Baker likes to call the ""building blocks for the conspiracy to murder theory"".One important block, raised on day one, was whether Diana was pregnant. Put forward by Mr Fayed, the claim for pregnancy was apparently supported in the past. with the evidence consisting of a personal phone call to Mr Fayed, and a Sunday People picture of the Princess forgetting to hold her tummy in. Producing it for the court, the judge described as ""famous"" (in what is presumably an unconscious echo of Dylan's cadences) this ""photograph of Diana in a leopard print swimsuit"", before pointing out that it was taken before her relationship with al Fayed's son had begun. Thus, ""her physique"" - as he delicately put it, could have nothing to do with Dodi.None the less, the judge reassured the court that this seeming impossibility would be soberly investigated - ""the question of whether Diana was pregnant at the time of her death is one that will be explored"". So, too, will be the question of her embalming - a process held by Mr Fayed to be part of a conspiracy to conceal the secret pregnancy. So will the question of Diana's engagement to Dodi Fayed, which is also alleged by Mr Fayed, though, one gathers, by none of Diana's close friends.Now that they see the enormous consideration being extended to Mr Fayed and his theories about the murderous nature of Prince Philip, many amateur investigators must wish that they, too, had put some of their more ambitious conjectures before the court. Is there no plan, for example, to examine the popular theory that Diana planned to stage her own death, in order to withdraw from public life? It can hardly be more preposterous than allegations made by the late princess herself, according to the judge, when she told an astonished lawyer that the queen was about to abdicate, while she and Camilla were both to be ""put aside"". Lord Justice Scott Baker revealed that Lord Mishcon said that Diana told him that Camilla was not really Charles's lover, but a ""decoy"" for his real favourite, the nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. ""She had also,"" the judge went on to say, ""been told that Miss Legge-Bourke had been operated on for an abortion and that she (HRH) would shortly be in receipt of a certificate.""It is tempting, once you're in the conspiratorial frame of mind, to see the judge's patient rehearsal of this dreadful stuff as, if not actually subversive, his meaning way of emphasising the abject, tabloid-serving agenda of this inquest. Hopefully, Lord Justice Scott Baker can only bear to talk about Dodi's girlfriend, Kelly, and Diana's famous leopard-print bathers - dishing out the original snap, with the rest of the court papers, for closer inspection by the masses - because he believes that if this final Diana fest is what it takes to once and for all satisfy Mr Fayed, then it is his duty, as the fourth coroner on the case, to get the job done.This might also explain the absurd court commentary that accompanies every single frame of the videos from the Ritz hotel. ""The Princess of Wales is carrying Dodi Al Fayed's cigar box"", a policeman said, presumably in case someone were subsequently to allege it was a bomb, or a baby's coffin. ""Trevor Rees-Jones is looking at his phone and notebook."" Later, as Henri Paul goes through a revolving door, ""you will see him holding his cigarillo box in his hand"".If Mr Fayed refuses to withdraw his accusations without having his months in court, then maybe we really do have to hear, again, about the embalming and the ring, about Paul Burrell's fears and Prince Philip's letters - not to mention the hitherto unsuspected role of cigar boxes and abortion certificates in the life of our favourite princess. Then again, is Mr Fayed remotely likely to retreat, if Prince Philip turns out, on the balance of probabilities, not to be a ruthless killer? You can't help thinking that it might have simpler, and definitely cheaper, if our secret services had just added him to the hit list."

If Blaine could be induced to stay, for all time, in his silly box, there could be many worse ways of acquiring British nationality by composing some appropriate insult in the English tongue, then throwing an egg at him.","Prince Philip has done something unprecedented. He has denied, in the strongest possible terms, that he ever called Princess Di a trollop or a harlot in any of his letters to her. This is not very regal behaviour, entering into a media mudfight, but apparently his hands were tied - Prince William had given him an ultimatum, and we can all imagine how shattering that was (""Deny these words, or I'll never look at you shyly from beneath my bambi hair ever again!"" he probably said). Clearly, this kind of nonsense shouldn't detain us for a second, whether true or not. The facts of the matter are in no doubt - the people's princess was doing the nasty with someone other than her husband for some time before their separation. Therefore, to anyone capable of using words like ""trollop"" and ""harlot"" without laughing, that makes her a trollop. It may never be known whether Prince Philip said as much to her face, but since he gets such timeless joy from saying things like ""Gosh, you're very black, aren't you? How hilarious!"" to the faces of black people, it seems unlikely that he curbed himself in the face of the harlot. Anyway, in a case where one person's dead and the other one's cuckoo, it doesn't matter terribly who said what; it only matters that the extant one is behaving rather unusually.  Devout royal watchers will have noticed that Philip made the news twice at the weekend - the other time, it was a brief mention of the fact that he was spotted ostentatiously leashing his Labrador while out walking, in tacit reference to Princess Anne's recent fine under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Obviously, he was making some kind of humorous statement, here: Labradors are charmless hulks of goodwill, they'd never maul anyone.  Perhaps he was saying, ""You crazy members of the public, I suppose you'll want me to leash my Labrador next!"", or perhaps he was saying something else altogether. But the juxtaposition of the two stories does remind us that Princess Anne's case was also unprecedented.  She isn't the first royal to own a dangerous dog, and she isn't the first to cause needless harm to her subjects by failing to do something that anyone with half a brain would have done, but she's certainly the first to be successfully prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act. The Queen, normally a stickler for boring old precedent, also behaved somewhat innovatively during the trial of Paul Burrell. There's certainly no precedent in living memory for a queen to give evidence against herself in a case she really needn't have brought to court, if she'd known she was going to do that (I wonder if she can now prosecute herself for wasting her own time).  All families have to break with tradition at some point, but there is a problem when the royals do it. Not because we set higher standards for them than we do for each other, since we're all perfectly aware how only-human they are. No, it's because precedent is all they've got. Precedent is all that's standing between them and the rest of busted-flush aristocracy; more importantly, from their point of view, it's all that's standing between them and proper income tax.  It is an undisputed fact that nobody accords the royals any constitutional importance whatsoever. Of 101 Labour MPs questioned by BBC1's On the Record, 80% said the Queen should be stripped of all constitutional powers. These people are supposed to be in charge! Why don't they just put their votes where their views are? Because of convention. Why does Tony Blair waste all that time chatting to the Queen, when he has no intention of doing what she says, and she's not going to say anything anyway? Because that's how it's done. Why do we submit to being subjects rather than citizens? Because that's the way it's always been.  If you spend one minute examining their role in the context of logic, rather than tradition, you cannot see the point of them. Even the staunchest monarchists, pressed on this family's purpose, can only come up with one of two things. Either, it's a tourist attraction (which I'd contest - or, better still, offset by building another London Eye). Or, they ask, ""What do we put in their place?"" - well, what indeed? A freely elected president? A toothless but benign head of state? Some kittens?  It doesn't matter, so long as it's been given serious thought; so long as the final decision is reached in accordance with the principles of modern democracy; basically, so long as there is some idea behind it other than ""Let's do what we did last year.""  Now, I'm not necessarily advocating the overthrow of the royal family, since on this issue, more than any other, I feel profoundly indifferent. I merely suggest that they should be a lot more careful, the next time they're tempted to wade imperiously into an issue, thinking to halt our tabloid chattering with one absolute assertion or denial.  Every time they do something they've never done before, however tedious it is, they're clawing through their own safety nets. There may not be much dignity in silence, but there's always a chance we'll forget they're there."
1,"In a speech this week, Prince Charles suggested that people remember not to fill their kettles too full. Here he explains why:  It seems to me that most people instinctively understand that to make a cup of tea it is not necessary to boil an entire kettle! And I, for one, simply cannot sit here and do nothing while, all around the world, whole kettles are boiled, regardless of the tragic consequences.  Do we need kettles at all? I happen to think their benefits are limited. In my quest to address the challenge of making tea without using a kettle, I sought to create a new example of sensitive, cauldron-based boiling that reflected local tradition and character. Despite a few early hiccups (very few supposedly advanced vacuum flasks are capable of keeping water at boiling point, even on the relatively short helicopter flight to Scotland), I am pleased to report that we are beginning to make a difference. Since a promising experiment with heated stones led to one or two minor injuries, all our tea at Highgrove has been made using energy from an open fire, kept  burning for the purpose, or inside a seasonal compost-warmer.  I happen to think that when consumers appreciate the difference between water that has been prepared without a thought, in a few seconds, and liquid from a pot, like ours at Highgrove, which has taken hours, perhaps days, of careful tending to reach boiling point, they too will reject kettles as not just unnecessary, but unacceptably black.","Since the American showman David Blaine believes himself to be the new Houdini, it follows that he should, like his more gifted predecessor, have decided to bring his tricks to London.

After two days in which the magician came under assault from fish and chips, eggs, golf balls, laser pens, wake-up calls from bhangra drums and women displaying their breasts, a spokesman for Sky television, which has bought the rights to this stunt, regretted that not everyone had been ""respectful to the challenge... unfortunately you will always get one or two thugs"". But the antics of these one or two had been enough to frighten Blaine's organisers into surrounding his crane-and-dangling-box arrangement with some untidy wire fencing. Now, with its profusion of electrical wires, tents and heavies, his ""Above the Below"" encampment below Tower Bridge looks about as edifying as the back end of a funfair.  Still, should you be looking for an agreeable picnic spot, I can think of no better place, just now, than below the above: the area of dusty, trodden-down prairie over which Blaine now languishes for a living. Not because the magician himself is much to look at. In a few weeks time, when he begins, like all ill-nourished down-and-outs to resemble someone who could be Lord Lucan, it might be different. For now, the visiting daredevil simply looks greasily out of sorts, podgy enough to last several weeks, and seems to share Tony Blair's lack of inhibition about yawning and picking at himself in public. No, the place is worth a detour not in order to admire Blaine, but to participate in an exhilarating act of collective ridicule. If you can take some food with you, so much the better. If not, I have discovered, even a blob of oily ice cream from the van tastes exquisite when consumed in the suspended company of the preposterous, faux-starving Blaine.  Improved security had done little, when I visited, to bring about the desired reverence for Blaine's very public diet. And the previous night's adulatory C4 documentary, in which the visitor proclaimed, ""I'm an artist, nothing more, nothing less,"" probably hadn't helped, even if it had attracted more people. Anyone who remembered Blaine's parting speculation about his chances - ""Will the air supply suddenly get cut off and cause suffocation... even death?"" - had only to look up to realise that the simple answer to this question, was, no, it wouldn't. You'd think he would have known that. Not with those two little windows.  The disparities between the advertised, and real event were such that you wondered if there could have been some kind of mistake. Weren't Tower Bridge and the Thames meant to be somehow involved, instead of just picturesquely adjacent? And on telly, a wide-eyed Nicky Campbell had referred repeatedly to ""solitary confinement"". Blaine had also stressed a desire for ""no distractions... I think that's the purest state you could be in... "" In practice, he has made his lit-up box the pinnacle of a non-stop party. Passing riverboats and vans tootle jolly hellos at him. Women wave. Spectators guffaw more or less in his face, shout at him to ""put the kettle on"", mime flying with their arms, threaten to come back with signs reading: ""Are you mental or what?"" When, laboriously, Blaine wraps a sheet round himself and makes as if to wee into a hidden tube, there are uproarious shouts of, ""He's having a piss!""; then, ""He can't still be having a piss""; then, ""No - he's wanking!""; then - after the business is seemingly complete - hearty cheers and applause.  Next, in his solitary confinement, Blaine takes up what we know, from Campbell's breathless tribute, to be ""his journal"". ""Day one,"" says a man behind me, ""Sat in a glass box."" ""Day two, still sitting in a glass box. Day three... ""  Paid observers inform us that after a while Blaine's body will begin a metabolic process known as ""ketosis"", in which, if I understand correctly, it eats itself for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A   year or so ago, this might have sounded quite awful and impressive. Alas for Blaine, one in 10 Britons have now learned from Dr Atkins that ketosis is in fact a ""wonderful process"" - that beatific stage of the slimming regime when the dieter begins to burn his own fat reserves, and so starts to become a lovelier, more streamlined person. Lucky Blaine! For different reasons, people who have been unable to eat because of advanced illness, and their relatives, may also find themselves indifferent to Blaine's agonies. If agonies they are. Though, being notably well covered, he seems unlikely to be as indifferent to food as Kafka's hunger artist, who never found any food that he liked, as Blaine's task is presumably made easier by the £5m he will earn from this episode of professional fasting.  Aside from micturate and attend to his journal, Blaine also waves for the cameras, turns over to show his tattoo, moves his sheet around, scratches his head and, from time to time, fills a water bottle from another tube. These actions are duly texted, photographed, reported and filmed on mobile phones - mostly redundant devices which seem almost to have been waiting for this still more redundant event in order to prove that they may, after all, occasionally serve a purpose: ""No, he's just sitting there, no, he hasn't moved, no, it's really funny... ""  This was not, you gathered from the Blaine programme, the intended response to ostentatious fasting, an act repeatedly introduced as ""his toughest endurance feat yet"". The crowd are supposed, like the American multitudes before them, to faint with anxiety, empathise through the long nights, discern some noble purpose in his supposed travails in the ice, up pillars, inside glass containers. Instead they watch, eat and cackle. To anyone who has recently felt downcast by popular displays of credulity and celebrity worship, this massed derision should come as a reassuring, even an inspiring, sight.  In fact, the prospect of Blaine at the mercy of a good humoured, but predominantly satirical crowd, composed of visitors of all ages, classes and ethnicities, hints at some residual, collective good sense, which can tell the difference between a huckster and a hero, and thus differentiates us from Americans. If Blaine could be induced to stay, for all time, in his silly box, there could be many worse ways of acquiring British nationality by composing some appropriate insult in the English tongue, then throwing an egg at him."
0,"In a speech this week, Prince Charles suggested that people remember not to fill their kettles too full. Here he explains why:  It seems to me that most people instinctively understand that to make a cup of tea it is not necessary to boil an entire kettle! And I, for one, simply cannot sit here and do nothing while, all around the world, whole kettles are boiled, regardless of the tragic consequences.  Do we need kettles at all? I happen to think their benefits are limited. In my quest to address the challenge of making tea without using a kettle, I sought to create a new example of sensitive, cauldron-based boiling that reflected local tradition and character. Despite a few early hiccups (very few supposedly advanced vacuum flasks are capable of keeping water at boiling point, even on the relatively short helicopter flight to Scotland), I am pleased to report that we are beginning to make a difference. Since a promising experiment with heated stones led to one or two minor injuries, all our tea at Highgrove has been made using energy from an open fire, kept  burning for the purpose, or inside a seasonal compost-warmer.  I happen to think that when consumers appreciate the difference between water that has been prepared without a thought, in a few seconds, and liquid from a pot, like ours at Highgrove, which has taken hours, perhaps days, of careful tending to reach boiling point, they too will reject kettles as not just unnecessary, but unacceptably black.","A few days ago, after a furious argument, I was thrown out of a wood where I have walked for more than 20 years. I must admit that I did not behave very well. As I walked away I did something I haven't done for a long time: I gave the gamekeeper a one-fingered salute. In my defence, I would plead that I was overcome with unhappiness and anger.The time I have spent in that wood must amount to months. Every autumn I would spend days there, watching the turning colours or grubbing for mushrooms and beechmast and knapped flints. In the summer I would look for warblers and redstarts. I saw a nightjar there once. It is one of the few peaceful and beautiful places in my part of the world that's within a couple of miles of a station: I could escape from the traffic without the help of a car. Part of me, I feel, belongs there. Or it did.It is not that I wasn't trespassing before. Nor has the status of the land changed: it is still owned, as far as I know, by the same private estate. No one tried to stop me in those 20-odd years because no one was there. But now there is a blue plastic barrel every 50 metres, and the surrounding fields are planted with millet and maize. The wood has been turned into a pheasant run. Having scarcely figured in the landowner's books, it must now be making him a fortune. And I am perceived as a threat.The words that rang in my ears as I stomped away were these: ""You've got your bloody right to roam now - why do you need to come here?"" It struck me that this could be a perverse outcome of the legislation for which I spent years campaigning: that the right to walk in certain places is seen by landowners as consolidating their relations with the public. All that is not permitted will become forbidden.But this, I expect, is a secondary problem. The more important one is surely the surge of money foaming through the south-east of England. A thousand woods can be filled with pheasants and still there are not enough to serve the people who have the money required - the many hundreds of pounds a day - to shoot them. We were told that the rising tide would lift all boats. But I feel I am drowning in it.Two weeks ago, writing in the Financial Times, the economist Andrew Oswald observed that ""the hippies, the greens, the road protesters, the downshifters, the slow-food movement - all are having their quiet revenge. Routinely derided, the ideas of these down-to-earth philosophers are being confirmed by new statistical work by psychologists and economists."" As I qualify on most counts, I will regard this as a vindication.Oswald's point is that the industrialised countries have not become happier as they've become richer. Rates of depression and stress have risen, and people report no greater degree of satisfaction with their lives than their poorer ancestors did. In the US, the sense of wellbeing has actually declined. One of the problems is that ""humans are creatures of comparison ... it is relative income that matters: when everyone in a society gets wealthier, average wellbeing stays the same.""The same point has been made recently by the New Economics Foundation and by Professor Richard Layard in his book Happiness. New developments in psychological testing and neurobiology allow happiness to be measured with greater confidence than before. Layard cites research that suggests that it peaked in the UK in 1975. Beyond a certain degree of wealth - an average GDP of around $20,000 per head - ""additional income is not associated with extra happiness"". Once a society's basic needs and comforts have been met, there is no point in becoming richer.I am astonished by the astonishment with which their findings have been received. Compare, for example, these two statements:""So one secret of happiness is to ignore comparisons with people who are more successful than you are: always compare downwards, not upwards."" Richard Layard, 2005.""It put me to reflecting, how little repining there would be among mankind, at any condition of life, if people would rather compare their condition with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings."" Daniel Defoe, 1719.We have been led, by the thinking of people such as the psychologist John Watson and the economist Lionel Robbins, to forget what everyone once knew: that wealth and happiness are not the same thing.Comparison is not the only reason the professors of happiness cite for our failure to feel better as we become richer. They point to the fact that we become habituated to wealth: Layard calls this ""the hedonic treadmill"". They blame the longer hours we work and our deteriorating relationships. But there is something I think they have missed: that wealth itself can become a source of deprivation.Having money enhances your freedom. You can travel further and you can do more when you get there. But other people's money restricts your freedom. Where you once felt free, now you find fences. In fact, you must travel further to find somewhere in which you can be free.As people become richer, and as they can extract more wealth from their property, other people become more threatening to them. We know that the fear of crime is a cause of unhappiness, but so is the sense of being seen as a potential criminal. The spikes and lights and cameras proclaim that society is not to be trusted, that we live in a world of Hobbesian relations. The story they tell becomes true, as property paranoia makes us hate each other. The harmless wanderer in the woods becomes a mortal enemy.It is hard to see how that plague of pheasants could be deemed to have caused a net increase in happiness. A group of very wealthy people, who already have an endless choice of activities, have one more wood in which to shoot. The rest of us have one less wood in which to walk. The landowners tell us that by putting down birds they have an incentive to preserve the woods - this was one of the arguments the gamekeeper used as he was throwing me off. But what good does that do us if we are not allowed to walk there?The Countryside and Rights of Way Act of 2000, which granted us the right to roam on mountains, moors, heath, downland and commons, has surely increased the sum of human happiness. But in those parts of the country that retain very little habitat of that kind (because it has been destroyed or enclosed by the land- owners), the gains we made then might already have been cancelled out by the losses, as the landlords' new opportunities for making money reduce our opportunities for leaving money behind.We need the full set of rights we were once promised, and which, in Scotland, have already been granted: access to the woods, the rivers and the coast as well as the open country. But as these places are turned into money-making monocultures, the question changes. Will we still want to visit them?"
1,"If the public, as Lord Justice Scott Baker declared this week, really does have ""concerns"" about the death of Princess Diana, it has a funny way of showing it. For all the ""groundless suspicion"" which, according to the judge, still exists in minds of many people, scarcely any of these haunted individuals turned up in court 73 at the Royal Courts of Justice this week, to have their anxieties officially allayed. To avoid disappointment, the courts had even laid on a special marquee, with a screen and rows of chairs. In the event, a two-man tent from Millets would have accommodated the spillover, with room to spare.Assuming it is not the fear that Prince Philip might demand their execution that keeps everyone away, it seems that Diana's death has become one of those odd subjects, like the likelihood of a November election, that is of consuming fascination to the media, even as it evokes, among the bulk of civilians, only a fathomless indifference. Where, the papers ask, did Henri Paul go in those crucial eight minutes? If we don't know now, after two official inquiries, we may well have to live with that mystery. Though of course we hope M Paul did not - as he certainly could have - use these missing minutes to ring the Duke of Edinburgh with the news that he was already pissed and about to get in the car.Meanwhile, as the Mail asked about a picture of Diana in a lift, ""What did her smile signify?"" That Diana liked going in lifts? Or did she really, as the Daily Mirror avers, have ""not a care in the world""? If the inquest finds that this was indeed the case, Tina Brown will certainly want to go back to her authoritative Diana Chronicles and adjust at least one word in her opening tour de force, an extended piece of Ritz hotel realite (""Diana was at the end of a chaotic night out, and her mood was sour""). And what about the surpassingly awful ""dis-moi oui"" ring? Was it a straightforward taste accident on the part of her lover, or, as some sources have hinted, a sinister plot by MI6 to make Dodi and Diana look vulgar?In reality, after three days of evidence (the jurors rested on the fourth, prior to next week's fact-finding trip to Paris) - the one, compelling mystery is that, following both a French inquiry and a British one, Mohamed Al Fayed should have prevailed on the authorities to recruit a judge, 12 jurors and an army of 30 lawyers, so they could all spend another six months, and an estimated &pound;10m, weighing up what Lord Justice Scott Baker likes to call the ""building blocks for the conspiracy to murder theory"".One important block, raised on day one, was whether Diana was pregnant. Put forward by Mr Fayed, the claim for pregnancy was apparently supported in the past. with the evidence consisting of a personal phone call to Mr Fayed, and a Sunday People picture of the Princess forgetting to hold her tummy in. Producing it for the court, the judge described as ""famous"" (in what is presumably an unconscious echo of Dylan's cadences) this ""photograph of Diana in a leopard print swimsuit"", before pointing out that it was taken before her relationship with al Fayed's son had begun. Thus, ""her physique"" - as he delicately put it, could have nothing to do with Dodi.None the less, the judge reassured the court that this seeming impossibility would be soberly investigated - ""the question of whether Diana was pregnant at the time of her death is one that will be explored"". So, too, will be the question of her embalming - a process held by Mr Fayed to be part of a conspiracy to conceal the secret pregnancy. So will the question of Diana's engagement to Dodi Fayed, which is also alleged by Mr Fayed, though, one gathers, by none of Diana's close friends.Now that they see the enormous consideration being extended to Mr Fayed and his theories about the murderous nature of Prince Philip, many amateur investigators must wish that they, too, had put some of their more ambitious conjectures before the court. Is there no plan, for example, to examine the popular theory that Diana planned to stage her own death, in order to withdraw from public life? It can hardly be more preposterous than allegations made by the late princess herself, according to the judge, when she told an astonished lawyer that the queen was about to abdicate, while she and Camilla were both to be ""put aside"". Lord Justice Scott Baker revealed that Lord Mishcon said that Diana told him that Camilla was not really Charles's lover, but a ""decoy"" for his real favourite, the nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. ""She had also,"" the judge went on to say, ""been told that Miss Legge-Bourke had been operated on for an abortion and that she (HRH) would shortly be in receipt of a certificate.""It is tempting, once you're in the conspiratorial frame of mind, to see the judge's patient rehearsal of this dreadful stuff as, if not actually subversive, his meaning way of emphasising the abject, tabloid-serving agenda of this inquest. Hopefully, Lord Justice Scott Baker can only bear to talk about Dodi's girlfriend, Kelly, and Diana's famous leopard-print bathers - dishing out the original snap, with the rest of the court papers, for closer inspection by the masses - because he believes that if this final Diana fest is what it takes to once and for all satisfy Mr Fayed, then it is his duty, as the fourth coroner on the case, to get the job done.This might also explain the absurd court commentary that accompanies every single frame of the videos from the Ritz hotel. ""The Princess of Wales is carrying Dodi Al Fayed's cigar box"", a policeman said, presumably in case someone were subsequently to allege it was a bomb, or a baby's coffin. ""Trevor Rees-Jones is looking at his phone and notebook."" Later, as Henri Paul goes through a revolving door, ""you will see him holding his cigarillo box in his hand"".If Mr Fayed refuses to withdraw his accusations without having his months in court, then maybe we really do have to hear, again, about the embalming and the ring, about Paul Burrell's fears and Prince Philip's letters - not to mention the hitherto unsuspected role of cigar boxes and abortion certificates in the life of our favourite princess. Then again, is Mr Fayed remotely likely to retreat, if Prince Philip turns out, on the balance of probabilities, not to be a ruthless killer? You can't help thinking that it might have simpler, and definitely cheaper, if our secret services had just added him to the hit list.","Since the American showman David Blaine believes himself to be the new Houdini, it follows that he should, like his more gifted predecessor, have decided to bring his tricks to London. It was, says Ruth Brandon in her biography of Houdini, the reception of his manacle escapes on the London stage that confirmed his ""uttermost hopes and expectations"". Houdini became so famous here, she adds, that Lord Northcliffe, the newspaper proprietor, visited his dressing room, asking advice on various topical events. And who knows? If Blaine's new stunt - ""his toughest endurance feat yet"" - comes off, maybe our own newspaper proprietors will soon be seeking enlightenment from this most sapient of nappy wearers. At the time of writing, however, it seems unlikely. So far from confirming his uttermost hopes and expectations, Blaine's encounter with the British public appears to have been his first ever encounter with sustained derision. After two days in which the magician came under assault from fish and chips, eggs, golf balls, laser pens, wake-up calls from bhangra drums and women displaying their breasts, a spokesman for Sky television, which has bought the rights to this stunt, regretted that not everyone had been ""respectful to the challenge... unfortunately you will always get one or two thugs"".

""Day two, still sitting in a glass box. Day three... ""  Paid observers inform us that after a while Blaine's body will begin a metabolic process known as ""ketosis"", in which, if I understand correctly, it eats itself for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A   year or so ago, this might have sounded quite awful and impressive. Alas for Blaine, one in 10 Britons have now learned from Dr Atkins that ketosis is in fact a ""wonderful process"" - that beatific stage of the slimming regime when the dieter begins to burn his own fat reserves, and so starts to become a lovelier, more streamlined person. Lucky Blaine! For different reasons, people who have been unable to eat because of advanced illness, and their relatives, may also find themselves indifferent to Blaine's agonies. If agonies they are.

It was felt to be more seemly to replace her holes with an enormous Perspex case filled with tens of thousands of leaf-cutter ants. The insects symbolised 'communal, instinctive minds, working together, carrying bright flecks of leaf along paths designed to resemble the tracks of a silicon chip'. The chips were powering the dotcom companies whose success was thrilling speculators the world over.  Whether the substitution of the ants was much of an improvement was difficult to judge. In their native South America, leaf-cutters are better known for their appetites than their symbolic representation of the internet. About a million march in unstoppable columns which strip trees in the rain forest and munch their way through the crops of destitute peasants with ruthless speed. They are parasitic and mindless agents of destruction.  Speaking of which, the case of Philip Anschutz, the founder and chairman of Qwest Communications, has resurfaced. His American telecoms company had been a wonder of the dotcom bubble. In 1999, Anschutz sold share options worth $1.5 billion (£960,000 million). He picked a good time to bail out of his company. By 2002, Qwest had lost 90 per cent of its value after it admitted inflating profits.  Last week he agreed to pay a $4.4m fine to settle allegations that he had accepted gifts of shares from investment banks which hoped he would send business their way. Despite his record, New Labour considers him a fit and proper person to take over the Dome, its own bubble by the Thames.  Every night I pray that the Dome story will never go away, and it looks as if my prayers are being answered."

A recollection which, when it came back to her - at a crucial stage of the butler's trial for theft - not only saved Burrell from jail, but coincidentally prevented more embarrassing disclosures from the witness box. Disclosures from Burrell, that is, not the Queen (the royal family still considering itself exempt from giving evidence in a criminal trial).   Shortly afterwards, when the same trial prompted allegations of financial impropriety in Prince Charles's household, the official version assured us that the best possible person to investigate the alleged malpractice was Charles's very own private secretary, an accountant called Sir Michael Peat. More recently there was some deliberate-looking obfuscation about which of Princess Anne's killer dogs had dispatched a corgi. When it was announced - after an internal inquiry, presumably headed by Peat - that it was Florence and not, as initially alleged, the known criminal Dotty, we were assured that, this killing being a first offence, the beast should live, like Dotty, to bite another day.

Leaving aside our regular references to the emperor who made his horse a consul, and the occasional, hazy deployment of Walter Bagehot, most journalists clearly feel that too much dwelling on the past will sound either schoolmasterish, or show-offy, or both at the same time.

Such is the case of the new Ghassanids, the Arab rulers. Muslims, if you do not punish them for their sins in Jerusalem and Iraq, they will defeat you. They will also rob you of the land of the two holy places.""   Did the early Ghassanid collaborators do so much damage? Wouldn't we have heard about it? Even at this distance? A rudimentary search confirms that the Ghassanids were, as Bin Laden states, successful and accomplished vassals of the sixth-century Byzantines. In the Oxford History of Byzantium, Robert Hoyland quotes a Ghassanid poet addressing his master: ""Do you not see that God has granted you such a degree of power that you will observe every king trembling at your feet; for you are the sun, the kings are stars, and when the sun rises, no star will be seen."" Less than a century afterwards the Ghassanids had been crushed in battle and absorbed into the rapidly expanding Islamic empire. Indeed, from this admittedly unscholarly perspective, it is hard to see how the defeat of the Ghassanid collaborators could be anything other than a reassuring precedent for the jihad-minded Bin Laden reader.  Still, whatever the lesson of the Ghassanids, Bin Laden's latest references to ancient history confirm comments made by Bernard Lewis, in his enlightening and lucid The Crisis of Islam. ""In current American usage,"" he says, ""the phrase 'That's history' is commmonly used to dismiss something as unimportant ... The Muslim peoples, like everyone else in the world, are shaped by their history, but unlike some others, they are keenly aware of it."" It is hard, he adds, ""to imagine purveyors of mass propaganda in the west making their points by allusions dating from the same period, to the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy in England or the Carolingian monarchs in France"". And even if our politicians did go in for more historical allusions, alluding to the past is not the same as trying to enforce it.  If there is no point in arguing with Bin Laden's implacable call to arms, there is every reason to try to comprehend his appeal to his followers. Which requires some acquaintance with history. Which, as we know, is not compulsory in the national curriculum for children over 14: precisely the age, some teachers point out, that they begin to understand it.","In a speech this week, Prince Charles suggested that people remember not to fill their kettles too full. Here he explains why:  It seems to me that most people instinctively understand that to make a cup of tea it is not necessary to boil an entire kettle! And I, for one, simply cannot sit here and do nothing while, all around the world, whole kettles are boiled, regardless of the tragic consequences.  Do we need kettles at all? I happen to think their benefits are limited. In my quest to address the challenge of making tea without using a kettle, I sought to create a new example of sensitive, cauldron-based boiling that reflected local tradition and character. Despite a few early hiccups (very few supposedly advanced vacuum flasks are capable of keeping water at boiling point, even on the relatively short helicopter flight to Scotland), I am pleased to report that we are beginning to make a difference. Since a promising experiment with heated stones led to one or two minor injuries, all our tea at Highgrove has been made using energy from an open fire, kept  burning for the purpose, or inside a seasonal compost-warmer.  I happen to think that when consumers appreciate the difference between water that has been prepared without a thought, in a few seconds, and liquid from a pot, like ours at Highgrove, which has taken hours, perhaps days, of careful tending to reach boiling point, they too will reject kettles as not just unnecessary, but unacceptably black."

Not just partly. Entirely. There is no field of political conflict where impression more fully eclipses reality. The two may not always be at odds. Some impressions are correct. Crime has doubled over the last 20 years, for example. That is a fact. Politicians' belief that the public wants only heavier sentencing is another truth that's not entirely fanciful. But the raw material Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe are handling when they promote this as an election issue is not fact but propaganda, otherwise known as spin. Consider the opening bids made yesterday. Mr Straw, introducing Labour's 10-year plan, said that his record on crime was ""the best of any incoming government for 50 years"". Sounds impressive. Ms Widdecombe countered that the Tory record from 1993-97 was the best four-year performance any outgoing government could show. Also, relatively, true. But what voter can begin to absorb, let alone believe, either statement, when every party is busy culling statistics to show that things have never been better, or, alternatively, worse in an area of policy where, depending when you start and what you cover and how you exclude and where you shade the figures, both claims are defensible?  Is crime going up? It depends what you're talking about. My colleagues Polly Toynbee and David Walker, in their valuable audit of the government, Did Things Get Better? (Penguin £6.99) take a   shot at it. Burglary? Down 21% in 2000. Car thefts? Down 15%, along with a 16% fall in thefts from cars. Crimes of violence fell by 4%. But street robbery? Up 14%. Clear-up rates? ""Haven't improved since 1997"", according to a worried memo from Straw's political adviser leaked this weekend. Ah, but what about convictions? ""Up by 13%,"" according to Straw on the Today programme yesterday.  Such statistics will fly about in the coming weeks. For the Tories are determined to make crime one of the biggest issues. It's one of the few they've got, perhaps the only one where the glass of governance will always reliably be seen as half empty not half full. For every stat, there may be an explanation that qualifies its meaning, as the Home Office's own research department often shows. What, why, when, where, how? You could write a book on each question applied to every crime, and people do. But in the politics of law and order, sophistication, however true, will always be outgunned by simplicity, however false.  This is made easier by public ignorance. In 1998 the British Crime Survey reported that the public thought judges' sentencing was too lenient. Four out of five people believed they were out of touch with what ""ordinary people think"". Questioned further, these ordinary people proved startlingly uninformed. Over half underestimated by at least 30% the sentences that were actually handed out. They believed half of male rapists were sent to prison, whereas the actual figure was 97%. House burglars and muggers   were similarly thought to be let off, when well over half in each category went to jail. Such are the sometimes grotesque misperceptions on which the reputation of the judiciary as a soft touch is based. Yet that's the image brainlessly cultivated by the tabloid press, which then finds its inescapable way into the critique and policies of ministers.  These policies are not always foolish. Serious experts are always trying to get to grips with the aberrations of social and human behaviour. The Thatcher-Major government passed a criminal justice act every year for so long that the later statutes began to undo what the earlier ones had done. The Blair government has a mixed record with its own creative initiatives. Both curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders, much brooded on and ostensibly reasonable, have failed to convince the people in the courts and on the ground, and have come to almost nothing. The latest proposed reforms also have something to be said for them. Explicitly permitting judges to take account of previous convictions when settling a sentence is a rational idea. It addresses the prime problem thrown up by the latest fashionable analysis, the familiar theme that much   crime is committed by no more than 100,000 people. The package looks like serious action. It's intended to be so. It should spin well, though the Tories will, as easily and bewilderingly, spin against it.  But through the murk and counter-murk three conclusions stare out, which confront ministers and their opponents with challenges that spinning doesn't adequately address. First, the best things the government wants to try will cost money. Yesterday's package is priced at £700m. Can this be enough to create the new custodial and semi-custodial regimes ministers talk of, pay courts to work twice as hard to accelerate hearings, and seriously increase police manpower all over the country? Of all remedies for deterrence and detection, common across all these confusing stats and counter-stats, a bigger police force is by far the most persuasive. Quite why Straw has so conspicuously failed to keep promises about police recruitment is a complicated mystery. It may not be entirely about money. But money will help. Is the Treasury committed to providing it for this vastly ambitious programme? Or are we watching mere propaganda sufficient unto May 3?  Second, though Straw, to show his all-round vision, stressed the causes of crime as much as crime itself, and commended the government's education and employment programmes, there's a hole at the heart of the picture. While offering drugs as an explanation for such crime problems   as he will admit to, he won't address the drug laws as a focus for reform, despite pressure and expert argument from those who are just as concerned and responsible as politicians. Decriminalising cannabis would wipe out a certain amount of crime at a stroke, freeing up police and courts for other priorities. The spinners dare not look at it.  Third, they dictate that prisons must go on blithely multiplying. Two of the less disputable current statistics are a) that Britain has the highest proportion of its population in prison of any country in Europe, and b) that, in a league table of crime as experienced by victims, England and Wales, with 58 crimes per 100 inhabitants, came out joint first in the industrialised world. No accountable politician is willing to make a connection between these profoundly interesting trends. The lord chief justice, the inspector of prisons, and the director of the prison service have all recently delivered clinical and passionate critiques of prison. The electoral auctioneers dare not change the terms of the debate.  One reason for this is that spinners can only deal with the lowest denominator of opinion, however ignorant. But the spinner always, more or less, lies. A more fruitful approach is available. The beginning of wisdom in the politics of law and order would be to understand that, since nobody can sort out one spinner from another, someone might start the arduous business of addressing the truth."
1,"If the government is to persuade us, contrary to appearances, of its determination to end discrimination against older people, it really must ensure that its senior members avoid dismissing eminent legal figures who have said something controversial as ""muddled and confused old codgers"". Not only does the insult reinforce malicious stereotypes and dishearten all of us currently struggling with the concept of unending subjection, it signally misrepresents two men who are, it seems to me, trying to teach us something rather beautiful about the transience and essential unimportance of material possessions. When Lord Irvine says that ""most people"" would not be ""disturbed"" at first, or maybe second time burglars not going to prison, it can only be because he expects us, like him, to care more for the spiritual life than we do for inanimate   things. Notice how he does not dwell on the sentimental value of what might have been taken: a grandmother's wedding ring, say, rather than a mobile phone. No, to him it is all so much heavy baggage, dragging us down. Neighbours in Cheyne Walk, where there have been 40 burglaries in the past three years, have complained that Irvine is unsympathetic. Have they considered that Lord Irvine might have his mind on higher things than the acquisition, or loss of, as it might be, fine art, or hand-made wallpaper or second homes in Scotland?  Similarly, though I have no knowledge of the extent of his property and other assets, I feel sure that Lord Woolf has only the highest motives when he asks us to imprison burglars only if their crimes are aggravated by violence or undue frequency. Lying awake, heart racing, listening for robber-sounds recently (the neighbours on either side having both been burgled in the past week, at night, from the empty street), I try to benefit from Lord Woolf and Lord Irvine's teachings. All is illusion. You can't take it with you. What goes around comes around. It's probably just a gentle novice burglar, so it doesn't count anyway. Isn't it rather sweet of this keen young burglar to force the window while you sleep, thus avoiding unnecessary panic? If he - they? - came upstairs, would turning the other cheek help? Meditating on this, I can almost hear these two great sages chorusing ""Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can."" I can, actually. Once you realise there are no police to speak of, hardly any convictions, no significant deterrents for all but the most dedicated and violent offenders - it's the easiest thing in the world.","Since the American showman David Blaine believes himself to be the new Houdini, it follows that he should, like his more gifted predecessor, have decided to bring his tricks to London. It was, says Ruth Brandon in her biography of Houdini, the reception of his manacle escapes on the London stage that confirmed his ""uttermost hopes and expectations"". Houdini became so famous here, she adds, that Lord Northcliffe, the newspaper proprietor, visited his dressing room, asking advice on various topical events. And who knows? If Blaine's new stunt - ""his toughest endurance feat yet"" - comes off, maybe our own newspaper proprietors will soon be seeking enlightenment from this most sapient of nappy wearers. At the time of writing, however, it seems unlikely. So far from confirming his uttermost hopes and expectations, Blaine's encounter with the British public appears to have been his first ever encounter with sustained derision. After two days in which the magician came under assault from fish and chips, eggs, golf balls, laser pens, wake-up calls from bhangra drums and women displaying their breasts, a spokesman for Sky television, which has bought the rights to this stunt, regretted that not everyone had been ""respectful to the challenge... unfortunately you will always get one or two thugs"". But the antics of these one or two had been enough to frighten Blaine's organisers into surrounding his crane-and-dangling-box arrangement with some untidy wire fencing. Now, with its profusion of electrical wires, tents and heavies, his ""Above the Below"" encampment below Tower Bridge looks about as edifying as the back end of a funfair.  Still, should you be looking for an agreeable picnic spot, I can think of no better place, just now, than below the above: the area of dusty, trodden-down prairie over which Blaine now languishes for a living. Not because the magician himself is much to look at. In a few weeks time, when he begins, like all ill-nourished down-and-outs to resemble someone who could be Lord Lucan, it might be different. For now, the visiting daredevil simply looks greasily out of sorts, podgy enough to last several weeks, and seems to share Tony Blair's lack of inhibition about yawning and picking at himself in public. No, the place is worth a detour not in order to admire Blaine, but to participate in an exhilarating act of collective ridicule. If you can take some food with you, so much the better. If not, I have discovered, even a blob of oily ice cream from the van tastes exquisite when consumed in the suspended company of the preposterous, faux-starving Blaine.  Improved security had done little, when I visited, to bring about the desired reverence for Blaine's very public diet. And the previous night's adulatory C4 documentary, in which the visitor proclaimed, ""I'm an artist, nothing more, nothing less,"" probably hadn't helped, even if it had attracted more people. Anyone who remembered Blaine's parting speculation about his chances - ""Will the air supply suddenly get cut off and cause suffocation... even death?"" - had only to look up to realise that the simple answer to this question, was, no, it wouldn't. You'd think he would have known that. Not with those two little windows.  The disparities between the advertised, and real event were such that you wondered if there could have been some kind of mistake. Weren't Tower Bridge and the Thames meant to be somehow involved, instead of just picturesquely adjacent? And on telly, a wide-eyed Nicky Campbell had referred repeatedly to ""solitary confinement"". Blaine had also stressed a desire for ""no distractions... I think that's the purest state you could be in... "" In practice, he has made his lit-up box the pinnacle of a non-stop party. Passing riverboats and vans tootle jolly hellos at him. Women wave. Spectators guffaw more or less in his face, shout at him to ""put the kettle on"", mime flying with their arms, threaten to come back with signs reading: ""Are you mental or what?"" When, laboriously, Blaine wraps a sheet round himself and makes as if to wee into a hidden tube, there are uproarious shouts of, ""He's having a piss!""; then, ""He can't still be having a piss""; then, ""No - he's wanking!""; then - after the business is seemingly complete - hearty cheers and applause.  Next, in his solitary confinement, Blaine takes up what we know, from Campbell's breathless tribute, to be ""his journal"". ""Day one,"" says a man behind me, ""Sat in a glass box."" ""Day two, still sitting in a glass box. Day three... ""  Paid observers inform us that after a while Blaine's body will begin a metabolic process known as ""ketosis"", in which, if I understand correctly, it eats itself for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A   year or so ago, this might have sounded quite awful and impressive. Alas for Blaine, one in 10 Britons have now learned from Dr Atkins that ketosis is in fact a ""wonderful process"" - that beatific stage of the slimming regime when the dieter begins to burn his own fat reserves, and so starts to become a lovelier, more streamlined person. Lucky Blaine! For different reasons, people who have been unable to eat because of advanced illness, and their relatives, may also find themselves indifferent to Blaine's agonies. If agonies they are. Though, being notably well covered, he seems unlikely to be as indifferent to food as Kafka's hunger artist, who never found any food that he liked, as Blaine's task is presumably made easier by the £5m he will earn from this episode of professional fasting.  Aside from micturate and attend to his journal, Blaine also waves for the cameras, turns over to show his tattoo, moves his sheet around, scratches his head and, from time to time, fills a water bottle from another tube. These actions are duly texted, photographed, reported and filmed on mobile phones - mostly redundant devices which seem almost to have been waiting for this still more redundant event in order to prove that they may, after all, occasionally serve a purpose: ""No, he's just sitting there, no, he hasn't moved, no, it's really funny... ""  This was not, you gathered from the Blaine programme, the intended response to ostentatious fasting, an act repeatedly introduced as ""his toughest endurance feat yet"". The crowd are supposed, like the American multitudes before them, to faint with anxiety, empathise through the long nights, discern some noble purpose in his supposed travails in the ice, up pillars, inside glass containers. Instead they watch, eat and cackle. To anyone who has recently felt downcast by popular displays of credulity and celebrity worship, this massed derision should come as a reassuring, even an inspiring, sight.  In fact, the prospect of Blaine at the mercy of a good humoured, but predominantly satirical crowd, composed of visitors of all ages, classes and ethnicities, hints at some residual, collective good sense, which can tell the difference between a huckster and a hero, and thus differentiates us from Americans. If Blaine could be induced to stay, for all time, in his silly box, there could be many worse ways of acquiring British nationality by composing some appropriate insult in the English tongue, then throwing an egg at him."

Have they considered that Lord Irvine might have his mind on higher things than the acquisition, or loss of, as it might be, fine art, or hand-made wallpaper or second homes in Scotland?  Similarly, though I have no knowledge of the extent of his property and other assets, I feel sure that Lord Woolf has only the highest motives when he asks us to imprison burglars only if their crimes are aggravated by violence or undue frequency. Lying awake, heart racing, listening for robber-sounds recently (the neighbours on either side having both been burgled in the past week, at night, from the empty street), I try to benefit from Lord Woolf and Lord Irvine's teachings. All is illusion. You can't take it with you. What goes around comes around. It's probably just a gentle novice burglar, so it doesn't count anyway. Isn't it rather sweet of this keen young burglar to force the window while you sleep, thus avoiding unnecessary panic? If he - they? - came upstairs, would turning the other cheek help? Meditating on this, I can almost hear these two great sages chorusing ""Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can."" I can, actually. Once you realise there are no police to speak of, hardly any convictions, no significant deterrents for all but the most dedicated and violent offenders - it's the easiest thing in the world.","He could have been almost anything he wanted for at least two or three productive decades. He could have had a career, made a name in his own right as uncle Linley has done, used the education bought for him at high price and the intelligence that came to him naturally. But instead he did the boring, banal thing. He chose what his younger brother - the one with the overworked elbow and dodgy A-level in art - had done only a few months ago. He opted for Sandhurst and a man's half-life in an army uniform.Thus the 23-year-old who would, sooner or later, be king faces a well-trodden few weeks of publicity. No beer, much relentless exercise. No sex or even trysts with Kate. Much yomping and early rising of the kind his dad remembers from Gordonstoun. It's routine publicity as the student prince turns to warrior prince for compact headline purposes. But it is also a dreadful waste of talent, another bumpy ride down the same rutted royal track.William, remember, is monarchy's last best hope: young, handsome, dashing, romantic. Most young voters, duly polled, would like him to be the next in line, the one who leaves his father alone in Highgrove to enjoy a leftover life of waiting in vain. Give us our media star asap!It won't happen, of course. Hereditary monarchies that start skipping generations for marketing's sake are signing their own death warrant. The Queen will not retire. She must go on and on. So, when his moment comes, must King Charles. And then, eventually, there is William.He will be 40 going on 50, or more. The David Cameron aura will have faded away, just like his hairline. Romance will have had its definitive day. This is James Hewitt territory with a twist of Charles Ingram added for millionaire luck. Mum always fancied chaps in uniform, we'll be told a hundred times. The throne, in extremis, will be saved or sunk by some ageing ex-Guards officer who relinquished a proper public profile for years when the barrack doors had closed behind him.The entire scenario reeks of defeat and disillusion. It is a very bad idea. Captain Willie Windsor won't live a life where reality bites. He will not - whatever blustering ex-colonels currently claim - be sent to Iraq or anywhere remotely dangerous. (Leave Harry as the only heir in town? You'd be cashiered first.) No, William will lead an active life for the cameras a suitable distance from any action. He will get promotion, but not too much of it. He will fill a recruiting slot. And then, in his middle or late 30s, he will be obliged to do what his father and uncle both did: that is, not very much, retired early, parked in the waiting room of monarchy.William, in sum, will become a killer of time and occasional cutter of ribbons. He can't be promoted too far, a runner of regiments, a power in the Ministry of Defence - because one fine day he'll be notional commander in chief of the whole damned show. He can rise so far but no further. He will be a lofty Guards officer who knows why lowlier guardsmen must keep their place. And then, like the Duke of York or papa for far too long, it will be more waving-and-shaking on Commonwealth circuits. Wills will be shopsoiled goods when his moment finally comes.Of course, the army (or navy or air force) has certain regal benefits for uncertain royals. Its entry requirements are benevolently enforced. It offers the company of other, suitably discreet fellow officers - and the hope that privacy can be protected once the mess bar is open. It provides a blameless, patriotic way of filling in a gap decade. But none of this is enough, not remotely enough. The army in its upper reaches is cut off from society, not fully part of the nation that must be ruled.Class distinctions and class pursuits still fill the pages of the Tatler. There's no way William can be a people's prince covered in braid as he gallops from polo ground to polo ground. There is no way he can keep in touch - or draw fulfilment from a job where the real rewards of danger and heroism are denied to him.He could have been so many things: a cartographer, using his geography degree; a schoolteacher, helping to shape young lives that would blossom as a legacy long after he'd left; a charity organiser, an Outward Bounder, a businessman learning to manage the Duchy estates in ways his father has never mastered. Even a journalist. He could, in short, have been useful - and signalled that his reign, at last, would be the start of something new, fresh and relevant.But no: the lack of inspiration and imagination is total, perhaps terminal. By the left, now, shuffle slowly towards oblivion ..."
1,"Who started this ""them and us"" between town and country? The mis-named Countryside Alliance when they marched on London last year and later brayed outside the Labour party conference in Bournemouth.Yesterday the prime minister went to Devon and blew their cover. They are not ""the countryside"". They are a bunch of Tory hunters and farmers who no more represent most country dwellers than red-braced commodity brokers in City champagne bars represent townies.Blair has the facts on his side and he delivered a barrage of them yesterday: the countryside is doing pretty well. There is a farming crisis, there is real rural poverty (though proportionately less) but life for most people in the country is better than in towns. They are healthier, happier, safer, better educated and richer. Not surprisingly townies tell pollsters they wish they lived there too. The traditional left likes to stress the two nations of the north/south divide while the right tries to capitalise on a rural/urban split, both playing to their own electoral heartlands. William Hague was stoking up that old anti-townie sentiment in his speech to the NFU this week: ""The rural way of life is under threat from urban values, Islington pressure groups and a metropolitan elite who know nothing about the countryside.""Tony Blair is attempting to dismantle the banality of these national semi-myths: the north is also rich, the south also poor, town and country share most common concerns. In Devon yesterday he rightly sought to disentangle the tiny farming industry from most of rural life. Agriculture is only 1% of GDP and only employs 2% of the workforce in England. Even in rural areas it only employs 4% of the workforce. Like everyone else, most people work in services or in small businesses. There is no ""rural crisis"".  But yes, there is indeed a farming crisis and this is the worst agricultural recession since the 30s. What should be done? ""Income can go down as well as up and is not guaranteed,"" says the very small print at the bottom of all financial service ads. Most of us live with that possibility because it is part of the human condition to know that disaster can strike.But farmers seem to consider themselves outside the cut and thrust of the normal market processes they so heartily endorse when they go into the polling booths to vote Tory. In real terms farmers' incomes rose by 100% between 1990 and 1995. But now they have dropped by 60% since then.   There's every reason to feel especially sorry for the 20% who are tenant farmers with nothing to sell up, but most farmers own valuable land, the price of which has soared recently.Yet even farmers sitting on a fortune think they should be bailed out. Why? Walk into the bankruptcy court any day of the week and case after case will bring tears to your eyes at the sight of so many decent people wiped out by bad luck or bad judgment. Two out of three new business start-ups fail. Farmers are not the only hard-pressed businessmen to commit suicide. Should the state step in and bail them all out?  Images of the harsh treatment meted out to the miners colour all our current attitudes towards compensating lame-duck industries. Mrs Thatcher said we couldn't and shouldn't pay people to dig out coal no one wanted, so now it's hard to see why farmers should be paid to breed unsaleable cattle, pigs and lambs. Global markets change and in over-producing meat, farmers misjudged their markets. It happens. We can feel very sorry for them, though their political attitudes don't always make it easy. Letting the Countryside Alliance be their advocate is about as helpful to their cause as Arthur Scargill was to the miners'.  Cleverer leadership would have had the farmers' tractors rolling down Whitehall long ago to protest at the high pound which is the gravest single cause of their distress. Other industries get some benefit from cheaper imported raw materials, but for farmers who import nothing the high cost of exporting is pure calamity. The NFU has always been pro-euro, but they haven't rolled out their tanks to demand early entry.Where are the green Barbours on platforms up and down the land demanding we join and that everything is done to lower interest rates, bring down the value of the pound and make euro entry possible? (Now we have missed entry on day one, the only way to lower interest rates without inflation is to raise taxation instead. Are they for it?) Instead the NFU conference applauded William Hague's strange pleas for more EU subsidy and didn't query his admission that ""the strong pound has hit all livestock farming with unprecedented ferocity"".   The farming lobby is powerful and emotive because it taps an atavistic national fantasy that everyone's roots or their retirement destination is the countryside of Hovis dreams. It was brave of Blair to face the farmers down with some home truths: adapt or die is his hard message. Labour has handed out £435m extra in direct aid to farmers, but from now on there will only be more for those things that are socially useful. Ten million - not enough - is to subsidise the cost of converting to organic or semi-organic methods. (Absurdly we import 70% of our organic produce as we don't grow enough here: there are long waiting lists of farmers wanting to convert.)Other funds will help turn farmers into countryside   stewards: we may not need sheep to eat, but we need them as lawn mowers on barely profitable hill farms, to preserve those much loved patchwork landscapes with dry-stone walls. There are grants for developing new industrial crops to generate energy, make plastics and grow hemp for manufacturing. But all these are small funds for small schemes. In the end the market is let rip. Except, of course, for the continuing disgrace of the CAP, whose snail's pace reform still hands out a monstrous £3bn farming subsidy mainly to those who need it least: 80% goes to 20% of the farmers, many of them the richest.  The future, the government suggests, lies in tourism, to which some farmers reply arrogantly that they don't want to be park-keepers. But for some it's that or nothing: 90% of the people live in towns and they want access to the country. They are the market and farmers   had better learn to smile at them instead of blocking footpaths and setting dogs on them. They may be townie sentimentalists but they want fewer pesticides polluting the soil and more live birds. (The RSPB has more members than all the political parties put together - and they are, incidentally, outraged that Blair's one pointless sop to the farmers this week was an unexpected pledge not to introduce a proposed pesticide tax to make farmers cut down on their use.) The Countryside Alliance's opposition to the right to roam was just another example of their disastrous leadership on rural matters: if they want to survive they are going to have to learn to love ramblers, picnickers and even people from Islington. No more of this ""them and us"" romance.","In the early morning rush-hour yesterday not one other soul stepped off the train at Greenwich North: this architectural wonder of a new tube station was empty. Under a wide, windswept sky the dome's great peninsula on the Thames lies deserted. Richard Rogers's iridescent jellyfish hovers there as dazzling as ever with its jutting yellow masts, a famous London landmark now. Forget its hollow contents - at night with the lights playing on the roof, it was as romantic and magical a sight as any in the capital. From the air foreigners arriving lean over and point to it in delighted recognition. But there are now only two weeks left before the government sells it off at a knock down price to the first company willing to take it off its hands fast. The dome is synonymous with disaster. Misfortune, miscalculation, mediocrity and mistake marked its miserable life so far. What government wouldn't want to be rid of it before an election? Even now, further revelation of the Mandelson/Hinduja connection rips another hole in the dome's reputation: the raising of £1m for the abysmal faith zone returns to haunt the place. The National Audit Office looms, scrutinising everything that was done and not done as lottery millions poured in month after month last year.  Robert Bourne's Legacy bid itself is tainted by a fat donation given by him to Labour party funds and a big birthday party thrown for Peter Mandelson. The place is a haunted political graveyard. No wonder they are eager to privatise it quick. But that would be the last and worst mistake of all.  After Nomura pulled out of its plan to keep the dome as a public theme park, Robert Bourne and his Legacy consortium seemed to be all that was left. So they got ""preferred bidder"" status, allowing them to continue negotiating without competition. Their bid is for a ""hi-tech business park"", which means filling the dome with modern offices. Their spokesman speaks of ""major IT companies, professional services, lawyers, accountants and academic institutions"" who have expressed an interest in moving in. Some of them will have technology on display for members of the public interested in viewing their products. Otherwise it will be closed, a private space for ever.  Once sold off, there will never again be a chance to keep this beautiful building on the one of the most dramatic London sites as a public leisure, exhibition and entertainment centre. It has - at great cost - the best transport links, including the river. The leisure industry, say the economists, is the future. London has no other space like it, desperately short of good concert venues compared with every other European capital. The dismal dinge of Wembley Arena, Earls Court or Olympia can't begin to compete with either the glamour or ease of access of the dome. Pop and mega-classical concertgoers, along with sports fans, have always   had to suffer miserable journeys and horrible conditions. Here, already paid for by us, is a place with every comfort and facility. Don't let them sell it off.  PY Gerbeau, until last week the dome's ebullient chief executive, thinks it can be saved. He had to stay silent until his contract ended, but by then Legacy had its peculiar ""preferred bidder"" status: his case may never be put. He has a major financial institution backing him, he has done the sums - and he knows the costings well. The government is full of praise for the way he stemmed the haemorrhage of money from the dome in the final months.  But will they listen - or will they hasten to be rid of it to Legacy? PY plans to run it as a visitor attraction in the day with the present contents enhanced: in the evenings it will be a concert and sports venue. He will build a hotel and conference centre and use the land around the dome as a village of themed restaurants and attractions - no housing or offices. He claims he will get 3m visitors a year and make a profit after two years. He will even offer the government more money than Legacy's timid £50m up front and £100m later. But he needs the attractions inside - especially the dazzling body zone sculpture (one of the few things of beauty). However, along with other key zones, the body will be demolished in two weeks. Will the government stay its hand and consider the PY bid?  The government is now legally bound not to even speak with other bidders. It says it must consider whether Legacy is the best value. But how is that judged without considering alternatives, and above all the public interest? The public has punted up the cash and must have an interest in keeping this great national asset for their own pleasure: £150m is peanuts compared with the near £1bn already spent, when the dome could be secured as a public amenity for ever.  The key to all this is property value. Hotly though they deny it, there is a canny suspicion that the Legacy bid will end up as a property deal. The invaluable land around the dome will be developed, the ""hi-tech"" park within may never quite materialise, never quite find all these tenants it promises. Unused, the dome would dilapidate until someone someday makes a fortune out of the land it stands on. Like the non-development of Battersea power station up-river, glittering promises from developers are not always all they seem. But even if Legacy does all it says, it still shuts down a public place.  Gerbeau's scheme also buys the site, but at least he keeps it as a public space (sale conditions should insist on that in perpetuity). Better still, PY would be quite happy to rent the dome for a fixed number of years which keeps open the option of returning it to public ownership at some future date - if ever an Olympic or World Cup bid required it. The land around is so valuable some could be sold off to create a trust fund for the dome's future. There are much more imaginative ways of saving the dome than selling it off in a hurry to Legacy. By now that will also be the worst political option, the one most likely to dog the government at the election: added to the breath of sleaze will be a grotesque mishandling of a priceless public asset.  Politicians always lag behind the public mood, out of fashion, fighting old battles instead of facing future challenges. This government's 90s mindset still wrestles with clause 4 versus privatisation - dead ducks both. Money is poured into Railtrack in exchange for nothing at all, as if afraid that buying back shares in it is socialism incarnate. They are still trying to sell off the tube and air traffic control against passionate public opposition. Now they want to sell off one of the finest heritage sites in London, just as the Tories very nearly sold off half the National Gallery - saved only by Sainsburys. Mrs Thatcher left behind no monuments but despite its accursed first year, Tony Blair might live to be proud of this one yet."

No more of this ""them and us"" romance.","To be honest, I rarely believe the Queen when she addresses the nation; the Christmas number is too much of a duty call, and when she has anything to do with parliament, she always looks slightly sour - as we all would, I'm sure, were we required to endorse absolutely everything, while still pretending to be in charge just to save trouble.When she spoke at the second world war commemoration, though, everything was spot on. You can believe in the debt she feels to the veterans' generation, and the continuing resonance its sacrifices have for her. The only jarring note was this: sandwiched between references to their ""resilience"" and ""courage"" was mention of their ""sense of humour"".I don't think I'm being unfair to her majesty when I say this isn't a language I'd expect her to understand, still less namecheck as a national boon. There is certainly no public record of her ever having made a joke, unless her experiment with crossing the short-legged corgi with the shorter-legged dachshund was actually done in the name of humour. There is likewise no photographic record of her laughing or smiling, apart from when Motivator won the 2005 Derby, earning the monarch ... well, I have no idea what her bet was, but even it was a fairly modest sum, that still leaves a smile related to acquisition, rather than actual mirth.This isn't just blinkered republicanism - there are royals who manifestly have a laugh. Princess Margaret was one; I fancy that Prince Andrew sometimes enjoys a joke or two, albeit of a coarse and obvious nature. I am speculating wildly, but he has the big mouth of a man who likes to laugh.The point is, though, that if you were to find anyone with a solid and expressible sense of British identity, then definitely in their top five, and probably their top two, would be the royal family and A Highly Developed Sense of Humour. There are a number of contradictions here: for a start, our figurehead lacks the one quality that we think recommends us; and the minute you start pontificating on the quality of your humour, it almost certainly rules out the possibility that you have any. But modern nationhood is a complicated business, so you'd expect anomalies.The substance of our fabled wit, as we see it, is this: first, it is much more advanced than any other country's, especially Germany. When people discuss the Blitz spirit, it is very often in terms of the cockney sparrows who lose a leg and then make a hilarious pun about getting legless. We are happy to admit that our bombing of German cities was as devastating as theirs of ours, but we are absolutely determined that it go down in the annals: whoever bombed whom to pieces, we definitely had the most fun. Oh yes. Humour is bound up with pluck and stoicism, as if its prime function were to keep our mouths so occupied with drolleries that moaning and whining were literally impossible.This is something that came out immediately after last week's bombing, a swell of pride in the age-old grit of the Londoner, another bad thing happening without denting our character. It was different to the response in Madrid. The underlying feelings - shock, mourning, sympathy, defiance - were the same, but where they took to the streets to vent them, we have been rigidly business-as-usual.That's not to say that there was an instant cache of tube-bomb jokes circulating over the net - that may happen and it may not. My feeling is that we've all lost our stomachs for the hilarity of breaking the bereavement taboo, which is why disasters such as Beslan or the tsunami spawned nothing like the one-liners they used to.But whether we ever joke about the attack itself is irrelevant. The capital, even by Thursday evening, had its sense of humour back: grim, black and muted it may have been, but the pubs were full. In other cultures, resilience is manifested in dignity and vigil, but here we manifest it exactly as the Queen said: with a sense of humour. We must be OK, because we're ready with our poor wordplay once more.I think this explains why figures such as Ken Livingstone are more welcome in bad times than Tony Blair - not because Ken is incapable of gravitas, but because we know his base register is more skittish and mischievous, closer to the normality we seek instantly to resume.The funny thing is, disasters aren't that funny. Thursday wasn't, and I'm sure the Blitz wasn't exactly a laugh. To take pride in such a response is quirky - but if even the Queen has noticed, it must be true."

The public has punted up the cash and must have an interest in keeping this great national asset for their own pleasure: £150m is peanuts compared with the near £1bn already spent, when the dome could be secured as a public amenity for ever.  The key to all this is property value. Hotly though they deny it, there is a canny suspicion that the Legacy bid will end up as a property deal. The invaluable land around the dome will be developed, the ""hi-tech"" park within may never quite materialise, never quite find all these tenants it promises. Unused, the dome would dilapidate until someone someday makes a fortune out of the land it stands on. Like the non-development of Battersea power station up-river, glittering promises from developers are not always all they seem. But even if Legacy does all it says, it still shuts down a public place.  Gerbeau's scheme also buys the site, but at least he keeps it as a public space (sale conditions should insist on that in perpetuity). Better still, PY would be quite happy to rent the dome for a fixed number of years which keeps open the option of returning it to public ownership at some future date - if ever an Olympic or World Cup bid required it. The land around is so valuable some could be sold off to create a trust fund for the dome's future. There are much more imaginative ways of saving the dome than selling it off in a hurry to Legacy. By now that will also be the worst political option, the one most likely to dog the government at the election: added to the breath of sleaze will be a grotesque mishandling of a priceless public asset.  Politicians always lag behind the public mood, out of fashion, fighting old battles instead of facing future challenges. This government's 90s mindset still wrestles with clause 4 versus privatisation - dead ducks both. Money is poured into Railtrack in exchange for nothing at all, as if afraid that buying back shares in it is socialism incarnate. They are still trying to sell off the tube and air traffic control against passionate public opposition. Now they want to sell off one of the finest heritage sites in London, just as the Tories very nearly sold off half the National Gallery - saved only by Sainsburys. Mrs Thatcher left behind no monuments but despite its accursed first year, Tony Blair might live to be proud of this one yet.","Who started this ""them and us"" between town and country? The mis-named Countryside Alliance when they marched on London last year and later brayed outside the Labour party conference in Bournemouth.Yesterday the prime minister went to Devon and blew their cover. They are not ""the countryside"". They are a bunch of Tory hunters and farmers who no more represent most country dwellers than red-braced commodity brokers in City champagne bars represent townies.Blair has the facts on his side and he delivered a barrage of them yesterday: the countryside is doing pretty well. There is a farming crisis, there is real rural poverty (though proportionately less) but life for most people in the country is better than in towns. They are healthier, happier, safer, better educated and richer. Not surprisingly townies tell pollsters they wish they lived there too. The traditional left likes to stress the two nations of the north/south divide while the right tries to capitalise on a rural/urban split, both playing to their own electoral heartlands. William Hague was stoking up that old anti-townie sentiment in his speech to the NFU this week: ""The rural way of life is under threat from urban values, Islington pressure groups and a metropolitan elite who know nothing about the countryside.""Tony Blair is attempting to dismantle the banality of these national semi-myths: the north is also rich, the south also poor, town and country share most common concerns. In Devon yesterday he rightly sought to disentangle the tiny farming industry from most of rural life. Agriculture is only 1% of GDP and only employs 2% of the workforce in England. Even in rural areas it only employs 4% of the workforce. Like everyone else, most people work in services or in small businesses. There is no ""rural crisis"".  But yes, there is indeed a farming crisis and this is the worst agricultural recession since the 30s. What should be done? ""Income can go down as well as up and is not guaranteed,"" says the very small print at the bottom of all financial service ads. Most of us live with that possibility because it is part of the human condition to know that disaster can strike.But farmers seem to consider themselves outside the cut and thrust of the normal market processes they so heartily endorse when they go into the polling booths to vote Tory. In real terms farmers' incomes rose by 100% between 1990 and 1995. But now they have dropped by 60% since then.   There's every reason to feel especially sorry for the 20% who are tenant farmers with nothing to sell up, but most farmers own valuable land, the price of which has soared recently.Yet even farmers sitting on a fortune think they should be bailed out. Why? Walk into the bankruptcy court any day of the week and case after case will bring tears to your eyes at the sight of so many decent people wiped out by bad luck or bad judgment. Two out of three new business start-ups fail. Farmers are not the only hard-pressed businessmen to commit suicide. Should the state step in and bail them all out?  Images of the harsh treatment meted out to the miners colour all our current attitudes towards compensating lame-duck industries. Mrs Thatcher said we couldn't and shouldn't pay people to dig out coal no one wanted, so now it's hard to see why farmers should be paid to breed unsaleable cattle, pigs and lambs. Global markets change and in over-producing meat, farmers misjudged their markets. It happens. We can feel very sorry for them, though their political attitudes don't always make it easy. Letting the Countryside Alliance be their advocate is about as helpful to their cause as Arthur Scargill was to the miners'.  Cleverer leadership would have had the farmers' tractors rolling down Whitehall long ago to protest at the high pound which is the gravest single cause of their distress. Other industries get some benefit from cheaper imported raw materials, but for farmers who import nothing the high cost of exporting is pure calamity. The NFU has always been pro-euro, but they haven't rolled out their tanks to demand early entry.Where are the green Barbours on platforms up and down the land demanding we join and that everything is done to lower interest rates, bring down the value of the pound and make euro entry possible? (Now we have missed entry on day one, the only way to lower interest rates without inflation is to raise taxation instead. Are they for it?) Instead the NFU conference applauded William Hague's strange pleas for more EU subsidy and didn't query his admission that ""the strong pound has hit all livestock farming with unprecedented ferocity"".   The farming lobby is powerful and emotive because it taps an atavistic national fantasy that everyone's roots or their retirement destination is the countryside of Hovis dreams. It was brave of Blair to face the farmers down with some home truths: adapt or die is his hard message. Labour has handed out £435m extra in direct aid to farmers, but from now on there will only be more for those things that are socially useful. Ten million - not enough - is to subsidise the cost of converting to organic or semi-organic methods. (Absurdly we import 70% of our organic produce as we don't grow enough here: there are long waiting lists of farmers wanting to convert.)Other funds will help turn farmers into countryside   stewards: we may not need sheep to eat, but we need them as lawn mowers on barely profitable hill farms, to preserve those much loved patchwork landscapes with dry-stone walls. There are grants for developing new industrial crops to generate energy, make plastics and grow hemp for manufacturing. But all these are small funds for small schemes. In the end the market is let rip. Except, of course, for the continuing disgrace of the CAP, whose snail's pace reform still hands out a monstrous £3bn farming subsidy mainly to those who need it least: 80% goes to 20% of the farmers, many of them the richest.  The future, the government suggests, lies in tourism, to which some farmers reply arrogantly that they don't want to be park-keepers. But for some it's that or nothing: 90% of the people live in towns and they want access to the country. They are the market and farmers   had better learn to smile at them instead of blocking footpaths and setting dogs on them. They may be townie sentimentalists but they want fewer pesticides polluting the soil and more live birds. (The RSPB has more members than all the political parties put together - and they are, incidentally, outraged that Blair's one pointless sop to the farmers this week was an unexpected pledge not to introduce a proposed pesticide tax to make farmers cut down on their use.) The Countryside Alliance's opposition to the right to roam was just another example of their disastrous leadership on rural matters: if they want to survive they are going to have to learn to love ramblers, picnickers and even people from Islington. No more of this ""them and us"" romance."
0,"In the early morning rush-hour yesterday not one other soul stepped off the train at Greenwich North: this architectural wonder of a new tube station was empty. Under a wide, windswept sky the dome's great peninsula on the Thames lies deserted. Richard Rogers's iridescent jellyfish hovers there as dazzling as ever with its jutting yellow masts, a famous London landmark now. Forget its hollow contents - at night with the lights playing on the roof, it was as romantic and magical a sight as any in the capital. From the air foreigners arriving lean over and point to it in delighted recognition. But there are now only two weeks left before the government sells it off at a knock down price to the first company willing to take it off its hands fast. The dome is synonymous with disaster. Misfortune, miscalculation, mediocrity and mistake marked its miserable life so far. What government wouldn't want to be rid of it before an election? Even now, further revelation of the Mandelson/Hinduja connection rips another hole in the dome's reputation: the raising of £1m for the abysmal faith zone returns to haunt the place. The National Audit Office looms, scrutinising everything that was done and not done as lottery millions poured in month after month last year.  Robert Bourne's Legacy bid itself is tainted by a fat donation given by him to Labour party funds and a big birthday party thrown for Peter Mandelson. The place is a haunted political graveyard. No wonder they are eager to privatise it quick. But that would be the last and worst mistake of all.  After Nomura pulled out of its plan to keep the dome as a public theme park, Robert Bourne and his Legacy consortium seemed to be all that was left. So they got ""preferred bidder"" status, allowing them to continue negotiating without competition. Their bid is for a ""hi-tech business park"", which means filling the dome with modern offices. Their spokesman speaks of ""major IT companies, professional services, lawyers, accountants and academic institutions"" who have expressed an interest in moving in. Some of them will have technology on display for members of the public interested in viewing their products. Otherwise it will be closed, a private space for ever.  Once sold off, there will never again be a chance to keep this beautiful building on the one of the most dramatic London sites as a public leisure, exhibition and entertainment centre. It has - at great cost - the best transport links, including the river. The leisure industry, say the economists, is the future. London has no other space like it, desperately short of good concert venues compared with every other European capital. The dismal dinge of Wembley Arena, Earls Court or Olympia can't begin to compete with either the glamour or ease of access of the dome. Pop and mega-classical concertgoers, along with sports fans, have always   had to suffer miserable journeys and horrible conditions. Here, already paid for by us, is a place with every comfort and facility. Don't let them sell it off.  PY Gerbeau, until last week the dome's ebullient chief executive, thinks it can be saved. He had to stay silent until his contract ended, but by then Legacy had its peculiar ""preferred bidder"" status: his case may never be put. He has a major financial institution backing him, he has done the sums - and he knows the costings well. The government is full of praise for the way he stemmed the haemorrhage of money from the dome in the final months.  But will they listen - or will they hasten to be rid of it to Legacy? PY plans to run it as a visitor attraction in the day with the present contents enhanced: in the evenings it will be a concert and sports venue. He will build a hotel and conference centre and use the land around the dome as a village of themed restaurants and attractions - no housing or offices. He claims he will get 3m visitors a year and make a profit after two years. He will even offer the government more money than Legacy's timid £50m up front and £100m later. But he needs the attractions inside - especially the dazzling body zone sculpture (one of the few things of beauty). However, along with other key zones, the body will be demolished in two weeks. Will the government stay its hand and consider the PY bid?  The government is now legally bound not to even speak with other bidders. It says it must consider whether Legacy is the best value. But how is that judged without considering alternatives, and above all the public interest? The public has punted up the cash and must have an interest in keeping this great national asset for their own pleasure: £150m is peanuts compared with the near £1bn already spent, when the dome could be secured as a public amenity for ever.  The key to all this is property value. Hotly though they deny it, there is a canny suspicion that the Legacy bid will end up as a property deal. The invaluable land around the dome will be developed, the ""hi-tech"" park within may never quite materialise, never quite find all these tenants it promises. Unused, the dome would dilapidate until someone someday makes a fortune out of the land it stands on. Like the non-development of Battersea power station up-river, glittering promises from developers are not always all they seem. But even if Legacy does all it says, it still shuts down a public place.  Gerbeau's scheme also buys the site, but at least he keeps it as a public space (sale conditions should insist on that in perpetuity). Better still, PY would be quite happy to rent the dome for a fixed number of years which keeps open the option of returning it to public ownership at some future date - if ever an Olympic or World Cup bid required it. The land around is so valuable some could be sold off to create a trust fund for the dome's future. There are much more imaginative ways of saving the dome than selling it off in a hurry to Legacy. By now that will also be the worst political option, the one most likely to dog the government at the election: added to the breath of sleaze will be a grotesque mishandling of a priceless public asset.  Politicians always lag behind the public mood, out of fashion, fighting old battles instead of facing future challenges. This government's 90s mindset still wrestles with clause 4 versus privatisation - dead ducks both. Money is poured into Railtrack in exchange for nothing at all, as if afraid that buying back shares in it is socialism incarnate. They are still trying to sell off the tube and air traffic control against passionate public opposition. Now they want to sell off one of the finest heritage sites in London, just as the Tories very nearly sold off half the National Gallery - saved only by Sainsburys. Mrs Thatcher left behind no monuments but despite its accursed first year, Tony Blair might live to be proud of this one yet.","In one of their few decision which could be described as being made on the grounds of good taste, the organisers of the Millennium Dome rejected a plan to exhibit 'Piss Flowers' by Helen Chadwick, a series of bronze moulds taken from cavities left after she had risked hypothermia for her art by peeing in the snow during a tour of Canada.  It was felt to be more seemly to replace her holes with an enormous Perspex case filled with tens of thousands of leaf-cutter ants. The insects symbolised 'communal, instinctive minds, working together, carrying bright flecks of leaf along paths designed to resemble the tracks of a silicon chip'. The chips were powering the dotcom companies whose success was thrilling speculators the world over.  Whether the substitution of the ants was much of an improvement was difficult to judge. In their native South America, leaf-cutters are better known for their appetites than their symbolic representation of the internet. About a million march in unstoppable columns which strip trees in the rain forest and munch their way through the crops of destitute peasants with ruthless speed. They are parasitic and mindless agents of destruction.  Speaking of which, the case of Philip Anschutz, the founder and chairman of Qwest Communications, has resurfaced. His American telecoms company had been a wonder of the dotcom bubble. In 1999, Anschutz sold share options worth $1.5 billion (£960,000 million). He picked a good time to bail out of his company. By 2002, Qwest had lost 90 per cent of its value after it admitted inflating profits.  Last week he agreed to pay a $4.4m fine to settle allegations that he had accepted gifts of shares from investment banks which hoped he would send business their way. Despite his record, New Labour considers him a fit and proper person to take over the Dome, its own bubble by the Thames.  Every night I pray that the Dome story will never go away, and it looks as if my prayers are being answered."
1,"The most remarkable aspect of William Hague's ill-judged outburst against the Macpherson report was his complete obliteration of what happened to Stephen Lawrence, what happened to the Lawrence family in their struggle for justice and finally what happened to the police who failed so abysmally to prosecute the killers. (Nothing). Hague has wiped out all three shameful events and replaced them with the charge that the Labour-instigated Macpherson report is instead the chief culprit. Macpherson, claims Hague, undermined police morale and law and order on the streets: accused of institutional racism, police fled the service, new recruits were hard to attract. The government admits Macpherson dealt a severe shock to the police. The truth hurt, but it was necessary and accepted by senior police officers. Police numbers, they say, are no longer declining. However Macpherson has entered Tory demonology as another liberal cause of crime.  Undeterred, the government yesterday moved to implement one of Macpherson's most important recommendations. A new genuinely Independent Police Complaints Commission will be in place by 2003. As campaigned for vigorously by Liberty and Inquest (and the Guardian), over the last 20 years, the police will no longer investigate themselves in serious cases. This is what Macpherson said: ""Since PCA inquiries, certainly in major cases, are   conducted with or through other police forces, the perception is that such investigations of police by police may not be seen to result in independent and fair scrutiny and that justice is not seen to be done"". Now at last it will be. No doubt the Tories will see this as yet another unwarranted assault upon the good name of the police, so it is worth recording some of the most serious recent cases.  Since 1990 there have been 548 deaths in police custody. Liberty and Inquest know of no police officer who has ever been prosecuted let alone jailed in relation to any of these events. All of them were investigated by the police themselves. These cases have taken years of dilatory investigation, ending with no police officers in court. Often officers slip off to early retirement on full pensions, signing themselves out with ""stress"" or ""disability"" before disciplinary action can be taken. Macpherson reported that at least five officers would have faced disciplinary charges, ""but such charges could not be pursued because the officers had retired"". He recommended new terms of employment to allow disciplinary proceedings to be brought after retirement, something that still waits to be done.  The many shocking cases that prompted this reform include that of Shiji Lapite. He was stopped by police for ""acting suspiciously"" and subsequently died from asphyxia as a result of a neckhold. The inquest jury was told that while caught in a   fatal neckhold, one officer bit Lapite in the chest and another twice kicked him in the head as hard as he could. Lapite suffered 36 separate injuries, his voice box fractured during strangulation. Yet despite an inquest's verdict of ""unlawful killing"" there was no prosecution of any of the officers. The man's family took the case up to judicial review, where both the PCA and the crown prosecutor admitted their decision in the case had been ""flawed"". After that an inquiry into the CPS's handling of police cases ordered all serious police cases to be sent to a central unit - yet still no prosecutions have ever followed.  The files of Liberty and Inquest are packed with such cases: some become famous such as Harry Stanley - the man shot dead for carrying a table leg in a bag - others just add to the statistics of those dead in prison or in police cells, often restrained by six or eight officers, often killed by lethal neckholds - but no one ever to blame. The reason they become famous cases is because they drag on forever, with no just or satisfactory resolution, leaving families in a constant state of public protest.  Dealing day in and day out with the mad, bad and violent inevitably causes some police officers to fly out of control. All police forces will have some dangerous officers or just some very frightened ones. What matters most is how bad cases are handled - transparently, fairly and fast. It matters for the reputation of the police, as well as for the victims. The idea that letting daylight into the police, as Macpherson did, somehow undermines them, lowers their morale or lessens their authority is the exact opposite of the truth. The better they deal with their own miscreants, the more they will be trusted and the more support they will get back from the communities they police. Often complainants just want an explanation and an apology - too rarely given.   Dealing well with complaints (there is a huge disparity between best and worst police forces), will presumably be dismissed by Hague as more of that ""paper-work"" that keeps bobbies off the beat. But ""paper-work"" is often what keeps bobbies on the beat. Managerial efficiency includes keeping a stern eye on absenteeism. The Met have cut their sickness rates from an average of 14 days per officer a year in 1996-7 down to only nine days a year last year. That saving is equivalent to an extra 500 officers on the beat.  As the election approaches, Labour is worrying about how to get across the fact that crime has fallen, not risen as people always imagine. Polls show people think their own neighbourhood is safer than   it was, but they still think crime ""out there"" is rising. Hardly surprising since everything they see and read tells them it must be so, local and national press as ever full of crime horrors, Crime Watch pumping it out every week, crime drama making violence seem to lurk everywhere. So far Labour has tried to seize popular support with strings of new laws, more crackdowns, more quick fixes. Child curfews and the like have little measurable effect on crime, but it all helps inflame fear of crime, now rebounding on Labour.  Jack Straw and Tony Blair have used law and order as a cheap vote-getter every bit as cynically as the Tories. It is the issue, after all, that created and defined New Labour. That killer leaked prime ministerial memo said it all: ""The government needs something tough with immediate bite which sends a message through the system. Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders. But this should be done soon and I personally should be associated with it."" Those five short sharp law-and-order and fraud measures in the pre-election Queen's speech show Labour just as eager to use and abuse fear of crime for its own political ends. But at least yesterday, in introducing a genuinely independent police complaints procedure, here is Labour doing the right thing for the right reason, even if it does give William Hague another chance to accuse them of weakening police morale.","Who started this ""them and us"" between town and country? The mis-named Countryside Alliance when they marched on London last year and later brayed outside the Labour party conference in Bournemouth.Yesterday the prime minister went to Devon and blew their cover.

Dealing well with complaints (there is a huge disparity between best and worst police forces), will presumably be dismissed by Hague as more of that ""paper-work"" that keeps bobbies off the beat. But ""paper-work"" is often what keeps bobbies on the beat. Managerial efficiency includes keeping a stern eye on absenteeism. The Met have cut their sickness rates from an average of 14 days per officer a year in 1996-7 down to only nine days a year last year. That saving is equivalent to an extra 500 officers on the beat.  As the election approaches, Labour is worrying about how to get across the fact that crime has fallen, not risen as people always imagine. Polls show people think their own neighbourhood is safer than   it was, but they still think crime ""out there"" is rising. Hardly surprising since everything they see and read tells them it must be so, local and national press as ever full of crime horrors, Crime Watch pumping it out every week, crime drama making violence seem to lurk everywhere. So far Labour has tried to seize popular support with strings of new laws, more crackdowns, more quick fixes. Child curfews and the like have little measurable effect on crime, but it all helps inflame fear of crime, now rebounding on Labour.  Jack Straw and Tony Blair have used law and order as a cheap vote-getter every bit as cynically as the Tories. It is the issue, after all, that created and defined New Labour. That killer leaked prime ministerial memo said it all: ""The government needs something tough with immediate bite which sends a message through the system. Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders. But this should be done soon and I personally should be associated with it."" Those five short sharp law-and-order and fraud measures in the pre-election Queen's speech show Labour just as eager to use and abuse fear of crime for its own political ends. But at least yesterday, in introducing a genuinely independent police complaints procedure, here is Labour doing the right thing for the right reason, even if it does give William Hague another chance to accuse them of weakening police morale.","Sometimes an apology is easier to give than to receive. We all know it from our own lives. The one who says sorry can sit back, happy that the moral high ground is theirs, that they have done their bit. But the person who has been handed the apology, what can they do? They may not be ready to accept it; they may still feel too bitter to forgive. Yet if they reject it, they will be damned as obstinate and mean-spirited. As it is around the kitchen table, writ small, so it is in Northern Ireland this week, writ large and tragic. On Tuesday the IRA offered its ""sincere apologies and condolences"" to the families of those ""non-combatants"" it killed or injured during the 30 years of the Troubles. In a statement cast more in the language of psychotherapy than armed struggle, the IRA declared an end to ""denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt"". In nine short paragraphs, the IRA used the word hurt three times, pain and grief twice each. And, in a break from past form, it blamed the British government not once.  Still, like so many apologies, this one will not be enough to heal the divided Northern Irish family. You could tell that straightaway. Some unionists followed the lead of Tom Donnelly, whose sister was killed on Bloody Friday - the 1972 IRA atrocity the imminent anniversary of which prompted the latest statement. He confessed himself overwhelmed by the apology, which he said gave him great hope.  But others, perhaps most, were cynical. They dismiss the IRA's words as yet another ploy by the republican movement to further its own political ends.   Specifically, they note a looming deadline: next Wednesday the British government has to declare whether or not the IRA is sticking to its ceasefire. If the answer is no, then Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble - who set the deadline - will demand Sinn Fein be ejected from Northern Ireland's self-ruling executive. To sceptical unionist eyes this week's apology was ""pure PR"", an IRA attempt to get into Tony Blair's good books before judgment day.  Which says something about the mood on the unionist street. Support for the Good Friday agreement remains strong among the business community and the well-heeled. But among the rank and file, says one senior UUP official, deep disenchantment has set in. Plenty of unionists regarded the 1998 deal as a ""moral outrage"" from the beginning - they were only prepared to hold their tongue in the hope that republicans were serious about ""getting out of the violence business"".  But the past 12 months have eroded what little faith there was in republicanism's peaceful intentions, say unionists. Last August's arrest of three republican operatives in Colombia, later charged with collaboration with the FARC narco-terrorist movement, blew the first major hole in unionist confidence. The March break-in at the Castlereagh security building - when ultra-sensitive security files were stolen - and ongoing street violence in Belfast have done the rest of the damage.  Now, say unionists, disillusion is so deep that if elections for the Northern Ireland assembly - due next May - were held tomorrow, Ian Paisley's anti-agreement Democratic Unionists would sweep Trimble's party to oblivion. Blair, they say, has to reassure unionists fast.   One move they would like to see next week, and which they insist is possible, is an American return to the peace process, in the form of a US team flown in to judge ceasefire compliance. Any envoy appointed by George ""war on terror"" Bush would be trusted by unionists and, they say, would buy Trimble valuable time.  That's not how republicans see it. They dismiss the US notion as fanciful for the same, strict reason they apply to all new initiatives: such a mechanism is not mentioned in the Good Friday agreement, which republicans refer to with jesuitical rigour. The same goes for current talk of a possible plea by Blair next week for a ""widening"" of the IRA ceasefire: if it's not in the agreement, it's not going to happen.  Besides, they believe that Tony Blair will not hand down the damning verdict on the IRA that Trimble is looking for: it won't be a clean bill of health from the PM, but enough to keep Sinn Fein in government. Was the apology designed to nudge that along? Few would doubt it. The timing, at least, smacks of the choreographed sequence between the IRA, London and Dublin that has become so familiar.  But don't miss the big picture, say republicans. This apology was ""a big deal"" - a hard move to make for a self-styled national liberation movement, which believes its cause was always just. It was not that long ago that Sinn Fein leaders could barely express regret about bombings and killings. Now the IRA itself, in its own words, apologises for the grief, pain and hurt it has inflicted.  So which side is right: the unionists who dismiss this week's statement as a   self-serving trick or republicans who want respect for having acted honourably? Maybe a useful way to answer the question is with a thought experiment. The year is 2031, and it is early September. Suddenly the TV news hums with word of a statement from the ruling council of al-Qaida. It speaks of regret for the suffering it inflicted 30 years earlier, on September 11.  Would those words heal the families of those lost in New York and Washington? Probably not. But would it say something about al-Qaida's intent to kill again, especially if that organisation had been on a ceasefire for the previous six to eight years? Wouldn't the whole world feel relieved if al-Qaida ever said such a thing?  So maybe it would have been better if the IRA apology had extended to everyone, including the ""combatants"" of the RUC and army, still regarded as heroes by unionists. And maybe the IRA move was prompted by opportunism - but what Machiavellian purpose were republicans trying to pursue, exactly? Only to stay in government, as is their right under the agreement. Like it or not, all these alleged ""ploys"", whether the decommissioning of arms or this week's apology, have been to one end: to keep the peace process afloat, now that republicans have decided that the process is in its own strategic interest.  Republicanism is on a journey, slow and incomplete, away from its paramilitary past to a political future. It is not neat or perfect, but it looks more real with each passing month. Not to see it requires a closed heart, to be sure, but also a pair of closed eyes. In peace processes, as in life, sometimes you have to know how to say yes."

She's had a good innings - her three-score years and 10 and then another score and 10. No one wants her to die, but it is entirely human not to be disabled by grief at her passing when her survival would have brought only decline and suffering. If you have similar feelings after the death of the Queen Mother - a woman 99.9 per cent of the country cannot count as a relative or friend - I advise you to keep them to yourself. Her stay in hospital last week revealed to those who work in the 'newzak' business that professional mourners are primed to howl with anguish and to howl down anyone who can't counterfeit pain. A gruesome media underworld starts to rumble whenever there's a royal health scare. BBC executives check if the afflicted is on the 'A-list' consisting of the Queen Mother, Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, or the 'B-list' of Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Edward Wessex and an unfortunate Duke of Edinburgh, who was relegated by the corporation last year - presumably for scoring too many own goals. Death in the premier league guarantees that scheduled programmes are replaced with funereal music before days of commemorative documentaries and moist news reports begin. B-list royals get second-rate tributes.  All broadcasters and newspapers, meanwhile, receive holding obituaries, stories and even leading articles from the Press Association news agency. Last week's flood of anticipatory copy included a suggested editorial for dunderheaded journalists unable to compose one themselves. ('The nation will mourn with gratitude the life of and service of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, ""Queen Mum"" to millions throughout the world.')  We learned from a separate piece you may read one day in your morning or evening paper or hear parroted on Radio 4 that as her body lies in state at Westminster Hall, 'vast crowds are expected to queue to file past the coffin. It will be placed high on a purple-draped catafalque on the same spot where King George VI lay in state in February 1952, and will be guarded round-the-clock by a contingent of Gentleman at Arms and Yeomen of the Guard. The ancient hall is an incomparable setting for the public's tribute to the royal lady they have loved and respected_' and so on at a length which might make the most ardent monarchist tear off his culottes.  The assumption that the nation will mourn runs through all the mainstream media's pre-cooked packages. And if a handful of perverse dissenters don't wail, they will be after them just as they were after anyone who failed to exhibit the required trauma after the death of Diana Spencer.  The shape of things of come could be    glimpsed in the  News of the World last year when it shrieked at Camelot executives for 'hatching a tasteless plot to protect their Saturday draw if the Queen Mum should die that day'. Their decision to go ahead with the lottery draw and announce the results in the small hours when the grieving bulletins were over for the night was the 'the ultimate in bad taste'.  If the nation was grieving, everyone would be too distracted to buy a lottery ticket and Camelot could take the week off. Its emergency planning to please the punters shows that Camelot at least knows that national mourning is not what it was.  The great vulgarity of monarchy is its transformation of private life into propaganda. Births, weddings and funerals are used to build customer loyalty to 'The Firm'. Throughout the disasters of the 1990s, courtiers and royalist commentators consoled themselves with the thought that the death of the Queen Mother would pull indifferent or hostile subjects back into line behind her less than perfect family. Extravagant designs for her funeral have been knocking around Whitehall and the media for years in a classified document entitled 'Operation Lion'. Its authors envisage nine days of mourning culminating in the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. The monarchy would define the nation again and dominate its emotions.  Anthony Holden, the critical royal biographer, wonders whether Buckingham Palace still has the nerve to implement 'Operation Lion'. 'People will be making comparisons all the time with the numbers Diana's funeral attracted,' he told me. 'Suppose the majority paying their respect are elderly and there's scarcely a young face in sight. Suppose viewers revolt about television being disrupted for nine days. It could be embarrassing.'  Indeed it could. Politicians and advertisers are being forced to realise that millions of disillusioned consumers are blanking out their messages. The court and the courtier press should have learned by now that the old levers no longer work. The evidence for boredom with royal marketing has been accumulating for years.  The great exception everyone quotes is the death of the ex-Princess of Wales. I wouldn't deny it provoked mass inanity which compelled anyone who believed in the rationality of public life to grab   the nearest whisky bottle. But the scale of 'the grief' during those freaky days was exaggerated at the time and has been mythologised since.  The day before her funeral the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said he would need almost all his 27,000 officers to control an expected crowd of six million. Two million turned up. A year later on the anniversary of the Paris smash, tribute programmes got abysmal ratings and the failure of public hug fests to attract anything resembling a crowd, or even a huddle, forced the BBC to decide 'most seem to have decided to do their mourning in private'.  This was too lame, even for the BBC. Its managers drew a realistic conclusion. They decided not enough viewers wanted to see the pageant for the Queen Mother's one-hundredth birthday and became the object one of the  Daily    Mail 's hate campaigns. ITV took over, and the BBC grovelled and admitted it was wrong. The week's brutal viewing figures showed the error was on ITV's side. Its Queen Mother special was a lamentable twenty-fifth in the ratings, behind  Charlie's Garden Army and a repeat of  It'll Be Alright on the Night (VIII) .  We reported last week that senior courtiers feared that next year's Golden Jubilee celebrations for Elizabeth II may be met by 'a wave of apathy' which could damage the monarchy, so they know something is wrong. What they don't appear to understand is why they're being swamped.  A small part of the explanation lies in distaste for the airbrushing of monarchy. Everything I've heard about the television obituaries, and everything I've seen in the Press Association files, suggests that the old line will be recycled that Queen Mother is above politics; have the skill 'to be wholly non-political in the present reign', as the  Telegraph said last week.  They must know this is drivel and she has the standard prejudices of an aristocrat of her generation. Woodrow Wyatt recorded in his diary of March 1986 the Queen Mother telling him that when the royal family are alone together they 'often drink a toast at the end of dinner to Mrs Thatcher. She adores Mrs Thatcher.'  She also adored P.W. Botha when he was President of South Africa, and thought the media and black Commonwealth was being beastly about the apartheid regime he managed. She was opposed to women priests, had suspicions of the French, a paradoxical hatred of the Germans and 'reservations' about Jews.  When she was Queen, she and George VI broke every constitutional propriety in their eagerness to support Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and oppose Winston Churchill. So great was their complicity that the Public Records Office refuses to release the papers covering the royal fondness for appeasing the Right in the Thirties until after the Queen Mother's death. They would cause 'substantial distress', apparently.  Perhaps they would, but in the long term greater and deserved distress is caused to the Windsors' reputation by the sycophancy and evasions of their supporters and the bullying of the millions who see no reason to share their stage-managed pain."

You can believe in the debt she feels to the veterans' generation, and the continuing resonance its sacrifices have for her. The only jarring note was this: sandwiched between references to their ""resilience"" and ""courage"" was mention of their ""sense of humour"".I don't think I'm being unfair to her majesty when I say this isn't a language I'd expect her to understand, still less namecheck as a national boon. There is certainly no public record of her ever having made a joke, unless her experiment with crossing the short-legged corgi with the shorter-legged dachshund was actually done in the name of humour. There is likewise no photographic record of her laughing or smiling, apart from when Motivator won the 2005 Derby, earning the monarch ... well, I have no idea what her bet was, but even it was a fairly modest sum, that still leaves a smile related to acquisition, rather than actual mirth.This isn't just blinkered republicanism - there are royals who manifestly have a laugh. Princess Margaret was one; I fancy that Prince Andrew sometimes enjoys a joke or two, albeit of a coarse and obvious nature. I am speculating wildly, but he has the big mouth of a man who likes to laugh.The point is, though, that if you were to find anyone with a solid and expressible sense of British identity, then definitely in their top five, and probably their top two, would be the royal family and A Highly Developed Sense of Humour. There are a number of contradictions here: for a start, our figurehead lacks the one quality that we think recommends us; and the minute you start pontificating on the quality of your humour, it almost certainly rules out the possibility that you have any. But modern nationhood is a complicated business, so you'd expect anomalies.The substance of our fabled wit, as we see it, is this: first, it is much more advanced than any other country's, especially Germany. When people discuss the Blitz spirit, it is very often in terms of the cockney sparrows who lose a leg and then make a hilarious pun about getting legless. We are happy to admit that our bombing of German cities was as devastating as theirs of ours, but we are absolutely determined that it go down in the annals: whoever bombed whom to pieces, we definitely had the most fun. Oh yes. Humour is bound up with pluck and stoicism, as if its prime function were to keep our mouths so occupied with drolleries that moaning and whining were literally impossible.This is something that came out immediately after last week's bombing, a swell of pride in the age-old grit of the Londoner, another bad thing happening without denting our character. It was different to the response in Madrid. The underlying feelings - shock, mourning, sympathy, defiance - were the same, but where they took to the streets to vent them, we have been rigidly business-as-usual.That's not to say that there was an instant cache of tube-bomb jokes circulating over the net - that may happen and it may not. My feeling is that we've all lost our stomachs for the hilarity of breaking the bereavement taboo, which is why disasters such as Beslan or the tsunami spawned nothing like the one-liners they used to.But whether we ever joke about the attack itself is irrelevant. The capital, even by Thursday evening, had its sense of humour back: grim, black and muted it may have been, but the pubs were full. In other cultures, resilience is manifested in dignity and vigil, but here we manifest it exactly as the Queen said: with a sense of humour. We must be OK, because we're ready with our poor wordplay once more.I think this explains why figures such as Ken Livingstone are more welcome in bad times than Tony Blair - not because Ken is incapable of gravitas, but because we know his base register is more skittish and mischievous, closer to the normality we seek instantly to resume.The funny thing is, disasters aren't that funny. Thursday wasn't, and I'm sure the Blitz wasn't exactly a laugh. To take pride in such a response is quirky - but if even the Queen has noticed, it must be true."

BBC executives check if the afflicted is on the 'A-list' consisting of the Queen Mother, Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, or the 'B-list' of Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Edward Wessex and an unfortunate Duke of Edinburgh, who was relegated by the corporation last year - presumably for scoring too many own goals. Death in the premier league guarantees that scheduled programmes are replaced with funereal music before days of commemorative documentaries and moist news reports begin. B-list royals get second-rate tributes.  All broadcasters and newspapers, meanwhile, receive holding obituaries, stories and even leading articles from the Press Association news agency. Last week's flood of anticipatory copy included a suggested editorial for dunderheaded journalists unable to compose one themselves. ('The nation will mourn with gratitude the life of and service of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, ""Queen Mum"" to millions throughout the world.')  We learned from a separate piece you may read one day in your morning or evening paper or hear parroted on Radio 4 that as her body lies in state at Westminster Hall, 'vast crowds are expected to queue to file past the coffin. It will be placed high on a purple-draped catafalque on the same spot where King George VI lay in state in February 1952, and will be guarded round-the-clock by a contingent of Gentleman at Arms and Yeomen of the Guard. The ancient hall is an incomparable setting for the public's tribute to the royal lady they have loved and respected_' and so on at a length which might make the most ardent monarchist tear off his culottes.  The assumption that the nation will mourn runs through all the mainstream media's pre-cooked packages. And if a handful of perverse dissenters don't wail, they will be after them just as they were after anyone who failed to exhibit the required trauma after the death of Diana Spencer.  The shape of things of come could be    glimpsed in the  News of the World last year when it shrieked at Camelot executives for 'hatching a tasteless plot to protect their Saturday draw if the Queen Mum should die that day'. Their decision to go ahead with the lottery draw and announce the results in the small hours when the grieving bulletins were over for the night was the 'the ultimate in bad taste'.  If the nation was grieving, everyone would be too distracted to buy a lottery ticket and Camelot could take the week off. Its emergency planning to please the punters shows that Camelot at least knows that national mourning is not what it was.  The great vulgarity of monarchy is its transformation of private life into propaganda. Births, weddings and funerals are used to build customer loyalty to 'The Firm'. Throughout the disasters of the 1990s, courtiers and royalist commentators consoled themselves with the thought that the death of the Queen Mother would pull indifferent or hostile subjects back into line behind her less than perfect family. Extravagant designs for her funeral have been knocking around Whitehall and the media for years in a classified document entitled 'Operation Lion'. Its authors envisage nine days of mourning culminating in the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. The monarchy would define the nation again and dominate its emotions.  Anthony Holden, the critical royal biographer, wonders whether Buckingham Palace still has the nerve to implement 'Operation Lion'. 'People will be making comparisons all the time with the numbers Diana's funeral attracted,' he told me. 'Suppose the majority paying their respect are elderly and there's scarcely a young face in sight. Suppose viewers revolt about television being disrupted for nine days. It could be embarrassing.'  Indeed it could. Politicians and advertisers are being forced to realise that millions of disillusioned consumers are blanking out their messages. The court and the courtier press should have learned by now that the old levers no longer work. The evidence for boredom with royal marketing has been accumulating for years.  The great exception everyone quotes is the death of the ex-Princess of Wales. I wouldn't deny it provoked mass inanity which compelled anyone who believed in the rationality of public life to grab   the nearest whisky bottle. But the scale of 'the grief' during those freaky days was exaggerated at the time and has been mythologised since.  The day before her funeral the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said he would need almost all his 27,000 officers to control an expected crowd of six million. Two million turned up. A year later on the anniversary of the Paris smash, tribute programmes got abysmal ratings and the failure of public hug fests to attract anything resembling a crowd, or even a huddle, forced the BBC to decide 'most seem to have decided to do their mourning in private'.  This was too lame, even for the BBC. Its managers drew a realistic conclusion. They decided not enough viewers wanted to see the pageant for the Queen Mother's one-hundredth birthday and became the object one of the  Daily    Mail 's hate campaigns. ITV took over, and the BBC grovelled and admitted it was wrong. The week's brutal viewing figures showed the error was on ITV's side. Its Queen Mother special was a lamentable twenty-fifth in the ratings, behind  Charlie's Garden Army and a repeat of  It'll Be Alright on the Night (VIII) .  We reported last week that senior courtiers feared that next year's Golden Jubilee celebrations for Elizabeth II may be met by 'a wave of apathy' which could damage the monarchy, so they know something is wrong. What they don't appear to understand is why they're being swamped.  A small part of the explanation lies in distaste for the airbrushing of monarchy. Everything I've heard about the television obituaries, and everything I've seen in the Press Association files, suggests that the old line will be recycled that Queen Mother is above politics; have the skill 'to be wholly non-political in the present reign', as the  Telegraph said last week.  They must know this is drivel and she has the standard prejudices of an aristocrat of her generation. Woodrow Wyatt recorded in his diary of March 1986 the Queen Mother telling him that when the royal family are alone together they 'often drink a toast at the end of dinner to Mrs Thatcher. She adores Mrs Thatcher.'  She also adored P.W. Botha when he was President of South Africa, and thought the media and black Commonwealth was being beastly about the apartheid regime he managed. She was opposed to women priests, had suspicions of the French, a paradoxical hatred of the Germans and 'reservations' about Jews.  When she was Queen, she and George VI broke every constitutional propriety in their eagerness to support Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and oppose Winston Churchill. So great was their complicity that the Public Records Office refuses to release the papers covering the royal fondness for appeasing the Right in the Thirties until after the Queen Mother's death. They would cause 'substantial distress', apparently.  Perhaps they would, but in the long term greater and deserved distress is caused to the Windsors' reputation by the sycophancy and evasions of their supporters and the bullying of the millions who see no reason to share their stage-managed pain.","The politics of law and order are entirely about spin. Not just partly. Entirely. There is no field of political conflict where impression more fully eclipses reality. The two may not always be at odds. Some impressions are correct. Crime has doubled over the last 20 years, for example. That is a fact. Politicians' belief that the public wants only heavier sentencing is another truth that's not entirely fanciful. But the raw material Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe are handling when they promote this as an election issue is not fact but propaganda, otherwise known as spin. Consider the opening bids made yesterday. Mr Straw, introducing Labour's 10-year plan, said that his record on crime was ""the best of any incoming government for 50 years"". Sounds impressive. Ms Widdecombe countered that the Tory record from 1993-97 was the best four-year performance any outgoing government could show. Also, relatively, true. But what voter can begin to absorb, let alone believe, either statement, when every party is busy culling statistics to show that things have never been better, or, alternatively, worse in an area of policy where, depending when you start and what you cover and how you exclude and where you shade the figures, both claims are defensible?  Is crime going up? It depends what you're talking about. My colleagues Polly Toynbee and David Walker, in their valuable audit of the government, Did Things Get Better? (Penguin £6.99) take a   shot at it. Burglary? Down 21% in 2000. Car thefts? Down 15%, along with a 16% fall in thefts from cars. Crimes of violence fell by 4%. But street robbery? Up 14%. Clear-up rates? ""Haven't improved since 1997"", according to a worried memo from Straw's political adviser leaked this weekend. Ah, but what about convictions? ""Up by 13%,"" according to Straw on the Today programme yesterday.  Such statistics will fly about in the coming weeks. For the Tories are determined to make crime one of the biggest issues. It's one of the few they've got, perhaps the only one where the glass of governance will always reliably be seen as half empty not half full. For every stat, there may be an explanation that qualifies its meaning, as the Home Office's own research department often shows. What, why, when, where, how? You could write a book on each question applied to every crime, and people do. But in the politics of law and order, sophistication, however true, will always be outgunned by simplicity, however false.  This is made easier by public ignorance. In 1998 the British Crime Survey reported that the public thought judges' sentencing was too lenient. Four out of five people believed they were out of touch with what ""ordinary people think"". Questioned further, these ordinary people proved startlingly uninformed. Over half underestimated by at least 30% the sentences that were actually handed out. They believed half of male rapists were sent to prison, whereas the actual figure was 97%. House burglars and muggers   were similarly thought to be let off, when well over half in each category went to jail. Such are the sometimes grotesque misperceptions on which the reputation of the judiciary as a soft touch is based. Yet that's the image brainlessly cultivated by the tabloid press, which then finds its inescapable way into the critique and policies of ministers.  These policies are not always foolish. Serious experts are always trying to get to grips with the aberrations of social and human behaviour. The Thatcher-Major government passed a criminal justice act every year for so long that the later statutes began to undo what the earlier ones had done. The Blair government has a mixed record with its own creative initiatives. Both curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders, much brooded on and ostensibly reasonable, have failed to convince the people in the courts and on the ground, and have come to almost nothing. The latest proposed reforms also have something to be said for them. Explicitly permitting judges to take account of previous convictions when settling a sentence is a rational idea. It addresses the prime problem thrown up by the latest fashionable analysis, the familiar theme that much   crime is committed by no more than 100,000 people. The package looks like serious action. It's intended to be so. It should spin well, though the Tories will, as easily and bewilderingly, spin against it.  But through the murk and counter-murk three conclusions stare out, which confront ministers and their opponents with challenges that spinning doesn't adequately address. First, the best things the government wants to try will cost money. Yesterday's package is priced at £700m. Can this be enough to create the new custodial and semi-custodial regimes ministers talk of, pay courts to work twice as hard to accelerate hearings, and seriously increase police manpower all over the country? Of all remedies for deterrence and detection, common across all these confusing stats and counter-stats, a bigger police force is by far the most persuasive. Quite why Straw has so conspicuously failed to keep promises about police recruitment is a complicated mystery. It may not be entirely about money. But money will help. Is the Treasury committed to providing it for this vastly ambitious programme? Or are we watching mere propaganda sufficient unto May 3?  Second, though Straw, to show his all-round vision, stressed the causes of crime as much as crime itself, and commended the government's education and employment programmes, there's a hole at the heart of the picture. While offering drugs as an explanation for such crime problems   as he will admit to, he won't address the drug laws as a focus for reform, despite pressure and expert argument from those who are just as concerned and responsible as politicians. Decriminalising cannabis would wipe out a certain amount of crime at a stroke, freeing up police and courts for other priorities. The spinners dare not look at it.  Third, they dictate that prisons must go on blithely multiplying. Two of the less disputable current statistics are a) that Britain has the highest proportion of its population in prison of any country in Europe, and b) that, in a league table of crime as experienced by victims, England and Wales, with 58 crimes per 100 inhabitants, came out joint first in the industrialised world. No accountable politician is willing to make a connection between these profoundly interesting trends. The lord chief justice, the inspector of prisons, and the director of the prison service have all recently delivered clinical and passionate critiques of prison. The electoral auctioneers dare not change the terms of the debate.  One reason for this is that spinners can only deal with the lowest denominator of opinion, however ignorant. But the spinner always, more or less, lies. A more fruitful approach is available. The beginning of wisdom in the politics of law and order would be to understand that, since nobody can sort out one spinner from another, someone might start the arduous business of addressing the truth."
1,"The healthy reaction to the death of a great-grandmother of 100 or so from her family is one of resignation, even quiet relief.

Everything I've heard about the television obituaries, and everything I've seen in the Press Association files, suggests that the old line will be recycled that Queen Mother is above politics; have the skill 'to be wholly non-political in the present reign', as the Telegraph said last week.They must know this is drivel and she has the standard prejudices of an aristocrat of her generation. Woodrow Wyatt recorded in his diary of March 1986 the Queen Mother telling him that when the royal family are alone together they 'often drink a toast at the end of dinner to Mrs Thatcher. She adores Mrs Thatcher'.She also adored P.W. Botha when he was President of South Africa and thought the media and black Commonwealth was being beastly about the apartheid regime he managed. She was opposed to women priests, had suspicions of the French, a paradoxical hatred of the Germans and 'reservations' about Jews.When she was Queen, she and George VI broke every constitutional propriety in their eagerness to support Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and oppose Winston Churchill. So great was their complicity that the Public Records Office refuses to release the papers covering the royal fondness for appeasing the Right in the 1930s until after the Queen Mother's death. They would cause 'substantial distress', apparently.Perhaps they would, but in the long term greater and deserved distress is caused to the Windsors' reputation by the sycophancy and evasions of their supporters and the bullying of the millions who see no reason to share their stage-managed pain.","It's a tough call for the policemen in charge of royal protection on the occasion of the family's big shindig. On the one hand, if the amiable hippies in charge of Glastonbury can get their heads around a ticket-only entry system, law enforcement officers of far more advanced jobsworth tendencies should have been able to prevent the gatecrash coup of a comedian dressed as a well-known terrorist. And yet, on the other hand, imagine the conversation - ""I have a man here, sarge, dressed as Osama bin Laden."" ""That's no good. Where's the fun in that?"" ""Well, given that the right-thinking individual doesn't find terrorism in any way amusing, I imagine the joke is that Johnny Foreigner is a funny fellow."" ""Oh, I see, well you'd better let him in, then. That's the theme of the   party."" ""Is that what Out of Africa means?"" ""Yup. Pretty much."" In a craven attempt to get some goods on William's sex life, certain newspapers have decided that his fancy dress idea derives from the hots he harbours for Jessica Craig. According to the Sunday Times, she is a 21-year-old member of ""Kenya's white elite"", though whether you can ascend into this white elite just by being white, or whether you have to be loaded as well, remains unclear (lest there be any doubt, however, she is also loaded).  The historian Andrew Roberts considers the theme as part of the wider family's relationship with the African continent. ""There is an inverse proportion between the amount of time the Windsors spend in Africa and the amount of power they have   there. After decolonisation, they went more and more."" I suppose the message there is that this is a very nice family which just gets along much better with people it is not actively oppressing. The party theme is therefore a loud hello to celebrate the end of a pernicious empire. But really, to interpret this as either a romantic or a political gesture is to back away from the glaring truth that this is party theming as devised by a complete arse.  First, although no reports have been exhaustive on the subject of Will's guest list, all the people who have been mentioned seem to have names that start with Second Earl of ... I wouldn't want to embarrass the palace by checking, but I am prepared to bet that the only black people at the party   were members of the band. While nobody can force a young Botswana-travelled royal to have African acquaintances who are not members of its ""white elite"", the act of making his whitey friends dress up in feathers rather tastelessly underlines the fact. After all, you probably wouldn't have an American-themed party if you had Americans you wanted to invite. They would turn up in their regular clothes, for one thing, and besides, might experience feelings of miffedness.  Imagine if someone in Africa had an English-themed party. There would be a lot of top hats and fans; some Jane Austen wear for people prepared to make the effort; a few wags might arrive with fake 12-bores and try to subjugate the rest of the party (with hilarious results); a costume of an   animal commonly associated with our island (in all probability, a pig) might make an appearance. The japes would be many and varied, but from our point of view, pretty insulting, having fallen back on the keystone cliches of Englishness - that we are starchy, uptight, brutal and we like bacon sandwiches.  Any attempt to represent a nation with its dress is bound to be reductive and therefore dehumanising. It stresses the otherness of foreigners, and rejects the global truth that most people, the world over,   dress more or less the same, apart from the ones who can't afford a telly.  Furthermore, if you look at the individual costumes chosen, you get an even stronger tang of - well, not wishing to bandy the ""racism"" word around too freely, let's call it ""look at the funny natives-ism"". There was a lot of leopard print and snakeskin which (on the basis of only one visit to Africa, granted), I'd say was a closer approximation of a Streatham singles night than an African style statement.  Many of the older gentlemen dressed up in safari suits, which is like going to a Spanish-themed party with a beer, a burger and some vivid red sunburn (sure, there are English people in every country, and they tend to look funny, but you wouldn't say they defined that country's aesthetic). Fergie   wore a long silver wig and whatever the message behind that, I'm sure, even if I knew, I would find it very offensive.  And finally, there is something unsettling about the ongoing (I believe unrequited) love that the posh have for Africa. It does not focus on the realities of its countries in their modern form, but rather is shot through with a plangent nostalgia. And honestly, the subtext of any nostalgia about this continent has to be that it was better when we still owned it.  All told, these are some very murky messages for a 21-year-old to be encouraging. It must be hard to get things right, living perpetually in the public eye. But he could afford to be a lot more dudelike, without getting any less regal."
1,"Up early to go to Belfast for the historic first meeting of the new Northern Ireland executive. Peter Mandelson is on the radio, sounding historic. He asks us to reflect on the ""enormity"" of what has happened this week. I check it in the OED: ""enormity - a monstrous wickedness, a crime or monstrous offence."" Another word lost to the language.  Belfast is as I remember it - permanently wet. The taxi roars up to Stormont, past the triumphalist Carson statue - how long can that survive? - to the massive parliament building, an edifice of a size and grandeur which would be appropriate if its denizens governed the Hapsburg empire, but which in this small, outlying province looks merely ridiculous.  It was here 30 years ago that I heard Brian Faulkner, the last Unionist prime minister, offer places in government to nationalist politicians - a deal not unlike the one which has just been agreed. But that was in the earliest days of the troubles; they would get much worse, 3,000 dead worse, and Faulkner's offer was as pointless as sticking a traffic cone in front of a tank.  You can tell how historic an event is deemed to be by the number of satellite TV trucks parked outside. Today I can see 13 - good news for history fans since that implies the story could make the Associated Press top twenty of the year's historic news events, somewhere between the Indian elections and the fall of Jeffrey Archer.  Inside the building we wait for the new executive to turn up. William Hague came in the morning, but no one seems to have noticed. Finally a Sinn Fein party walked down the great staircase, past the statue of Lord Carnarvon, and addressed us, looking as they generally do, sour but historic.  Gerry Adams spoke in Irish, then in English, but it didn't make any difference,   since his words were lost, bouncing off the vast marble walls, the carved stone, the lavish brasswork, the painted ceiling and the massive chandeliers.  Lord Carnarvon would have considered this lot Fenian bogtrotters. The sight of them standing in the midst of that splendour - ""a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people"" as it was called - might have made his statue crumble, but it was still upright when the party went back up, affording us the chance to notice that Gerry Adams climbs stairs rather like Groucho Marx, which is something you don't see on TV.  The executive met for the first time at 3pm. I followed up the stairs to hear the   Rev Ian Paisley, whose DUP is refusing to sit in the executive along with Sinn Fein, but whose ministers will take part in government and committees.  Paisley is an unchanging constant, and you could measure the progress of the troubles by the whitening of his hair. ""I have been told this is a daybreak - but there is no daybreak for the children of Northern Ireland!""  He claimed - Paisley always has a scoop - that Bairbre de Brun, the Sinn Fein health minister, was demanding to know the religious affiliation of civil servants, so that she could sack the Protestants. Paisley's enduring appeal to his electorate is that he treats the Unionists as if they were   the oppressed minority. On and on he roared.  ""You, the press, have told wicked lies! This is no new daybreak. It is a new night, and we do not know what midnight will bring!"" I would have written more, but my Pentel which writes letters of fire had run out.  As he ploughed on, the DUP assemblymen around him looked first embarrassed and then bored. Their evident ennui near their leader may be a hopeful sign.  Messrs Trimble and Mallon emerged from the historic first meeting to report historically good progress. They were heckled. ""What about those who were   murdered?"" shouted someone, who could have come from either side. In the crush I found myself jammed up against Martin McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff who is now education minister. He is a big man, and was wearing a well-cut suit, with neatly trimmed hair and highly polished shoes.  He looked like a minister, not a terrorist. Why was I just faintly reminded of the last chapter of Animal Farm?","John Prescott paid a welcome visit to the House of Commons yesterday to launch his department's new white paper, Our Towns And Cities: The Future.

Why was I just faintly reminded of the last chapter of Animal Farm?","Driving north with an indomitable determination to allow neither floods nor Railtrack to cut me off from civilisation, I listened to a radio programme in which Michael Wills MP admitted that the prime minister had given him a special task. He is to encourage other members of the government to pay special respect to our national identity - always in their speeches and whenever possible in their policy decisions. People who know Mr Wills tell me that he is among the brightest and best of the new political generation. He will need all his talents if he is to discharge his new responsibilities successfully. For he has to begin by deciding which nation he is going to identify. Then - having chosen between Great Britain, the United Kingdom and the countries which make up the still heterogeneous union - provide a working definition of what the appropriate national identity is. All the easy answers to his questions have more to do with fascism than philosophy.  Let me, in order to avoid the accusation of loving every country better than my own, describe my attitude towards England. It is the only place in which I want to live. Indeed, with the exception of Scotland - in which I spend a couple of happy weeks each summer - it is the only place in which I want to be for any length of time. English is the only language I speak and the only literature I know well. I enjoy England's unpredictable weather and its ever changing landscape. I still hope that the New Jerusalem can be builded here.  So I can answer the question about which national identity matters to me easily enough. I am British only by the legal definition of my citizenship. But I am English by instinct and emotion. However, Mr Wills cannot base his work on any such dichotomy. The national identity which our Scottish prime minister wishes to promote must at least embrace Great Britain. John Major's notion of a people bound together by village cricket, warm beer and old ladies cycling to church will not do for Tony Blair. It will not do for me either. Despite my sentimental attraction to the reigns of Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria (when the idea of England was established) the country in which I want to live is multiracial and more concerned with facing the hard challenges of the future than dwelling on the glories of the past.  There is a ready definition of British nationality which Mr Wills could use as the basis of his work. Quite rightly he has rejected it. It is usually illustrated by a description of territorial acquisitions and claims of military success. Both illustrations lead to the conclusion that there is something superior about this sceptred isle. We can argue about whether of not Rudyard Kipling's reference to ""lesser breeds without the law"" was a statement of his true opinion or an ironic criticism of a chauvinism which he had come to hate. Either way, it an eloquent illustration of what British identity meant at the end of the 19th century.  I fear that Mr Wills's definition, when he hits upon it, will have many of the same shortcomings. If what he said on radio is to be believed, he means to encourage a view of our national identity which is based on characteristic values - love of fair play, belief in justice, devotion to liberty. We can only define Britain by those admirable qualities if we assert or imply that they are absent, or less pronounced, in other nationalities. Are the French less compassionate and the Swedes more intolerant than we are? I am too insular to know the answer. But to suggest that we are superior to them in these respects is not   very different from regarding them as lesser breeds without the law.  In truth Mr Wills's task is no more about encouraging respect for our national identity than it is about deciding whether Shakespeare belongs to England or to the world. His job is to make sure that ministers sound as if they are ""standing up for Britain"". That is an attitude which I wholeheartedly support on those occasions when Britain is right. But that is quite different from defending every element of ""Britishness"" - from outdated monarchy to antiquated independent nuclear deterrent - that the Tory party claim tests the government's love of country.  I feared that before I finished this there would be a reference to ""love of country"" - a phrase which, being properly English, I find embarrassing. So I cover my shame by describing how mine came about. Chickens are irrevocably attached to the first hen they see after they burst from the egg. For all of my formative years all I knew was England. Irrational affection has its advantages. Even when the old bird begins to moult, it remains an object of irrational devotion. But the irrationality should only go so far. Claims to superiority are both demeaning and dangerous."

The commissioning editor wrote back to say that was a relief; the publishers had feared I might demand &pound;10,000 per word.But I suspect something like that must have happened when Jonathan Ross's agent contacted the BBC. ""Tell you, what, Jonno, we'll have a laugh, we'll ask for six mill a year, and settle for what? &pound;500k? Twice what you're worth, mate, but no harm in trying, right?"" Then the word comes back from Broadcasting House: ""Yes, of course, six million is eminently reasonable. We'll send the contract over ..."" Mr Ross's salary has now become the great symbol of BBC profligacy and financial incontinence, and there was much talk of it at the bash to celebrate 50 years of the Today programme this week. John Humphrys said in his speech he was sorry Jonathan Ross couldn't be with us: ""He's at Buckingham Palace giving the king of Saudi Arabia advice about what to do with his money."" It's the kind of thing that creates a boiling and roiling resentment in every other person who works for the BBC, especially in radio, where the fees are famously limp.The fact is that the BBC has such range, such clout, and so many outlets that it can create its own stars. It doesn't need to pay vast sums to bring in established people from outside (Graham Norton) and it doesn't need to beggar itself by holding on to those who are offered ridiculous sums elsewhere. You only need to look at Hancock and Morecambe and Wise to see what can happen to those who follow the cash.<b>·</b> There was much talk of great Today programme fiascos, such as the time Jack de Manio couldn't conduct an interview because he was locked in the toilet. Or the occasion at the start of the Iraq war when Tony Benn appeared to pronounce anathemas on all concerned. But instead of him, they accidentally played a tape of Mongolian throat music. ""So, Mr Benn, what's your view?"" ""Wurghhh, urggh ..."" I'd have enjoyed that. Ming Campbell was there looking happy and relaxed. We got on to the subject of lawyers who are also politicians, and he told a story about the late John Smith. He'd been defending a man accused of attempted murder with a knife. The fellow was convicted, so Smith paid the customary visit to the cells to commiserate and apologise. ""Not to worry, Mr Smith,"" he said cheerfully, ""you were so good I was believing you myself!""<b>·</b> It is my habit, when I pass near the ancient wine merchants of Berry Bros and Rudd in St James, London, to pop in and gaze at their fine wine room. Last time I looked the second most expensive wine on sale was a Chateau Petrus 1990 at &pound;3,600 - per bottle. The priciest of the lot was the 1990 Chateau Le Pin, which now retails at &pound;3,800. The grapes are not trodden by horny-footed peasants.People sometimes ask if it's worth it, and the answer is obviously no, except to folk who use such wine to demonstrate their enormous wealth. Absurd to imagine that it is a hundred times better than a fine claret from a less famous name, or even a thousand times better than Sainsbury's rouge.But wine pricing is a weird business. This week I went to the launch of the 1998 vintage of Pol Roger's prestige line, Cuv&eacute;e Sir Winston Churchill. It is, as you would imagine, very delicious. And it costs &pound;100 a bottle. But a tiny amount is made, and they are desperately anxious not to get the bling, rock stars and Russian millionaires image. So they refuse to provide it to people who they fear might sell it on to certain West End nightclubs or restaurants. Their long-term image is more important than the immediate profits.They told me darkly that there is a new breed of PR person whose job it is to reduce sales. Companies like Burberry have been horrified to see yobs wearing their design, and some champagne houses are similarly afflicted. So they employ people to discourage the wrong sort of customer. I wonder how they work? ""Nah, mate, you don't want this stuff. Now, Woolworth's fiver-a-bottle bubbly, you'll love that ...""Next day I went to a tasting of vintage Hine cognacs (these events tend to come in clusters). We were taken through nine brandies, including the 1944, which was fabulous, by Bernard Hine. He is an outgoing, elderly chap with faultless English and a majestic white moustache. Among the terms bandied about to describe the brandies were ""figs, crystallised fruit, gingerbread, honey, apricots, flowers, quince, toast, vanilla, cloves, mushrooms, orange peel, truffles and jasmine"" - one of those corporate Christmas hampers in a bottle.At one point a guest said he thought he detected fuel. M Hine looked like a Bateman colonel. His eyes bulged and his nostrils dilated. ""Fee-you-ell?"" he shouted. ""Fee-you-ell? I do not like that word!"" I thought he was a little unfair - the greatest Rieslings, for example, often have a touch of kerosene, and believe me, it all adds to the flavour.<b>·</b> To a literary lunch in Cambridge, to plug my book of sketches, The Hands Of History, and the two round-robin books, now collected in paperback as The Christmas Letters. (Incidentally I'll be doing the annual round-up in January next year; all contributions very gratefully received.) I was slightly alarmed to see that I had been placed next to Princess Michael of Kent, whose image in the press has not always been entirely favourable. To my surprise, she turned out to be extremely friendly, unpretentious, and very chatty about all sorts of topics. For example, she does a lot of work with wildlife preservation, and she told me that baby elephants have ears as thin as the skin on a crispy duck. If they're orphaned they lack the shade of a parent. This means that sun cream has to be applied to their ears. Not many people know that.<b>·</b> Last week I said that Sir Geoffrey Bindman had, at the knighthood ceremony, stepped on to the kneeling stool and walked up next to the Queen. His son, Dan, tells me that this is untrue - instead he hopped straight on to the dais. I am glad to correct the record, and apologise for any inconvenience caused."

He is considering an Urban Policy Board, and a Cabinet Committee is to hold an Urban Summit in the year 2002. Let's not forget the Integrated Transport   White Paper, the New Deal for Communities and the Social Exclusion Unit. Capital letters were all over the shop, each in charge of a resonant abstraction.  We hacks were abjured yesterday by Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press secretary to mark the difference between scepticism and cynicism. My attitude to Mr Prescott's statement was a balanced mixture of both.  At one point, for example, he reminded us that Lord Rogers had said, ""people make cities, but cities make citizens"". Tories giggled at this, crying ""wozzat mean?""  ""Think about it!"" he bellowed back, though I'm afraid I was none the wiser. You could say, ""people make   cars, but cars make drivers"", or ""people make alcohol, but alcohol makes alcoholics"".  This kind of talk spreads among the very people who use it. Mr Prescott got confused about the technical terms for a city. ""The city of York already is a city, as is my own city of Hull is a city, and that I think is the definition of city and town.""  Faced with these massive piles of abstract thought, there was little the Tory spokesman, Archie Norman could say or do. ""The only time we ever see the deputy prime minister,"" he grumped, ""is when he has a glossy brochure or a disaster to announce.""  Or, I reflected yesterday, possibly both at the same time.","Prince Philip has done something unprecedented. He has denied, in the strongest possible terms, that he ever called Princess Di a trollop or a harlot in any of his letters to her. This is not very regal behaviour, entering into a media mudfight, but apparently his hands were tied - Prince William had given him an ultimatum, and we can all imagine how shattering that was (""Deny these words, or I'll never look at you shyly from beneath my bambi hair ever again!"" he probably said). Clearly, this kind of nonsense shouldn't detain us for a second, whether true or not. The facts of the matter are in no doubt - the people's princess was doing the nasty with someone other than her husband for some time before their separation. Therefore, to anyone capable of using words like ""trollop"" and ""harlot"" without laughing, that makes her a trollop. It may never be known whether Prince Philip said as much to her face, but since he gets such timeless joy from saying things like ""Gosh, you're very black, aren't you? How hilarious!"" to the faces of black people, it seems unlikely that he curbed himself in the face of the harlot. Anyway, in a case where one person's dead and the other one's cuckoo, it doesn't matter terribly who said what; it only matters that the extant one is behaving rather unusually.  Devout royal watchers will have noticed that Philip made the news twice at the weekend - the other time, it was a brief mention of the fact that he was spotted ostentatiously leashing his Labrador while out walking, in tacit reference to Princess Anne's recent fine under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Obviously, he was making some kind of humorous statement, here: Labradors are charmless hulks of goodwill, they'd never maul anyone.  Perhaps he was saying, ""You crazy members of the public, I suppose you'll want me to leash my Labrador next!"", or perhaps he was saying something else altogether. But the juxtaposition of the two stories does remind us that Princess Anne's case was also unprecedented.  She isn't the first royal to own a dangerous dog, and she isn't the first to cause needless harm to her subjects by failing to do something that anyone with half a brain would have done, but she's certainly the first to be successfully prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act. The Queen, normally a stickler for boring old precedent, also behaved somewhat innovatively during the trial of Paul Burrell. There's certainly no precedent in living memory for a queen to give evidence against herself in a case she really needn't have brought to court, if she'd known she was going to do that (I wonder if she can now prosecute herself for wasting her own time).  All families have to break with tradition at some point, but there is a problem when the royals do it. Not because we set higher standards for them than we do for each other, since we're all perfectly aware how only-human they are. No, it's because precedent is all they've got. Precedent is all that's standing between them and the rest of busted-flush aristocracy; more importantly, from their point of view, it's all that's standing between them and proper income tax.  It is an undisputed fact that nobody accords the royals any constitutional importance whatsoever. Of 101 Labour MPs questioned by BBC1's On the Record, 80% said the Queen should be stripped of all constitutional powers. These people are supposed to be in charge! Why don't they just put their votes where their views are? Because of convention. Why does Tony Blair waste all that time chatting to the Queen, when he has no intention of doing what she says, and she's not going to say anything anyway? Because that's how it's done. Why do we submit to being subjects rather than citizens? Because that's the way it's always been.  If you spend one minute examining their role in the context of logic, rather than tradition, you cannot see the point of them. Even the staunchest monarchists, pressed on this family's purpose, can only come up with one of two things. Either, it's a tourist attraction (which I'd contest - or, better still, offset by building another London Eye). Or, they ask, ""What do we put in their place?"" - well, what indeed? A freely elected president? A toothless but benign head of state? Some kittens?  It doesn't matter, so long as it's been given serious thought; so long as the final decision is reached in accordance with the principles of modern democracy; basically, so long as there is some idea behind it other than ""Let's do what we did last year.""  Now, I'm not necessarily advocating the overthrow of the royal family, since on this issue, more than any other, I feel profoundly indifferent. I merely suggest that they should be a lot more careful, the next time they're tempted to wade imperiously into an issue, thinking to halt our tabloid chattering with one absolute assertion or denial.  Every time they do something they've never done before, however tedious it is, they're clawing through their own safety nets. There may not be much dignity in silence, but there's always a chance we'll forget they're there."

Peter Mandelson is on the radio, sounding historic. He asks us to reflect on the ""enormity"" of what has happened this week. I check it in the OED: ""enormity - a monstrous wickedness, a crime or monstrous offence."" Another word lost to the language.  Belfast is as I remember it - permanently wet. The taxi roars up to Stormont, past the triumphalist Carson statue - how long can that survive? - to the massive parliament building, an edifice of a size and grandeur which would be appropriate if its denizens governed the Hapsburg empire, but which in this small, outlying province looks merely ridiculous.  It was here 30 years ago that I heard Brian Faulkner, the last Unionist prime minister, offer places in government to nationalist politicians - a deal not unlike the one which has just been agreed. But that was in the earliest days of the troubles; they would get much worse, 3,000 dead worse, and Faulkner's offer was as pointless as sticking a traffic cone in front of a tank.  You can tell how historic an event is deemed to be by the number of satellite TV trucks parked outside. Today I can see 13 - good news for history fans since that implies the story could make the Associated Press top twenty of the year's historic news events, somewhere between the Indian elections and the fall of Jeffrey Archer.  Inside the building we wait for the new executive to turn up. William Hague came in the morning, but no one seems to have noticed. Finally a Sinn Fein party walked down the great staircase, past the statue of Lord Carnarvon, and addressed us, looking as they generally do, sour but historic.  Gerry Adams spoke in Irish, then in English, but it didn't make any difference,   since his words were lost, bouncing off the vast marble walls, the carved stone, the lavish brasswork, the painted ceiling and the massive chandeliers.  Lord Carnarvon would have considered this lot Fenian bogtrotters. The sight of them standing in the midst of that splendour - ""a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people"" as it was called - might have made his statue crumble, but it was still upright when the party went back up, affording us the chance to notice that Gerry Adams climbs stairs rather like Groucho Marx, which is something you don't see on TV.  The executive met for the first time at 3pm. I followed up the stairs to hear the   Rev Ian Paisley, whose DUP is refusing to sit in the executive along with Sinn Fein, but whose ministers will take part in government and committees.  Paisley is an unchanging constant, and you could measure the progress of the troubles by the whitening of his hair. ""I have been told this is a daybreak - but there is no daybreak for the children of Northern Ireland!""  He claimed - Paisley always has a scoop - that Bairbre de Brun, the Sinn Fein health minister, was demanding to know the religious affiliation of civil servants, so that she could sack the Protestants. Paisley's enduring appeal to his electorate is that he treats the Unionists as if they were   the oppressed minority. On and on he roared.  ""You, the press, have told wicked lies! This is no new daybreak. It is a new night, and we do not know what midnight will bring!"" I would have written more, but my Pentel which writes letters of fire had run out.  As he ploughed on, the DUP assemblymen around him looked first embarrassed and then bored. Their evident ennui near their leader may be a hopeful sign.  Messrs Trimble and Mallon emerged from the historic first meeting to report historically good progress. They were heckled. ""What about those who were   murdered?"" shouted someone, who could have come from either side. In the crush I found myself jammed up against Martin McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff who is now education minister. He is a big man, and was wearing a well-cut suit, with neatly trimmed hair and highly polished shoes.  He looked like a minister, not a terrorist. Why was I just faintly reminded of the last chapter of Animal Farm?"

It's been a catalogue of familiar terrace and semi-detached houses intermingled with housing estate flats that seem indistinguishable, whether in London, Birmingham or Yorkshire; a snapshot of Britain's not-so-glorious underbelly but a vivid visual reminder that the men who have murdered us, or tried to, were either born and bred in Britain or made their homes here.The ties that bind and the minimal shared assumptions that might fend off savage hatred have not operated; these are men so disaffected with Britishness that they have sought identity and meaning in the doctrines of jihad, martyrdom and the casting of their fellow citizens as valueless infidel who can be murdered without conscience. Nor are they alone. They represent a vital sub-culture that may be a minority but is growing and casts long shadows among the generality of British Muslims. In New Southgate we watched a young British Muslim outside the ninth floor flat of a suspected bomber express his sympathy with the ideas of martyrdom.It's a disconnect that is more general; when the reportedly rational leader of Birmingham's Central Mosque says that he does not trust the word of the police and government about the Islamic identity of the bombers, it is symbolic of what has happened. Britain, the writ of Britishness and what seems obvious to the rest of us leaves a critical mass of British Muslims cold; they refuse to believe what is palpably true. Whatever mix of responses you think are needed to lift the threat of the bombs - changing British foreign policy or sharper intelligence - part of the story will have to be persuading young British Muslims that Britishness is an idea worth a minimal degree of loyalty that inhibits mass murder. The question is whether it's up to such a task. Do the British even have a shared conception of what our identity is?This is a debate where the markers are already being put down by the ascendant right, and the undertones are ugly. Britain is in this vulnerable position, runs the argument, because it has been too liberal across the board - from allowing asylum seekers from Somalia and Eritrea to carelessness about non-English speaking imams spreading jihad in British mosques. On that bridgehead of shared concern, it's not hard to take the conservative argument further; Britain is too polyglot, access to its generous welfare state is too easy and there's been too much concern for tolerance, observance of human rights and concern for the underdog. And this speaks to a so far unspoken but just below the surface sentiment; Enoch Powell's warning that the streets would one day run with blood has been proved right. Britishness must be recast around conservative values and the same mistake not made again.This is all too combustible tinder, but one of the paradoxical saving graces of Britishness is that it is too vague an idea to be deployed in such a way. Whether Norman Davies documenting how Britain has been constructed from successive waves of immigration in The Isles, or historian Linda Colley describing how Britain was essentially an eighteenth century political artefact as the result of the union of England, Wales and Scotland in Britons, both unite to show how the idea of Britain is not a faith like the idea of, say, France, or America - or nationalistic like the idea of China or Russia.It's a political jurisdiction that has common practical mores while allowing our emotional identity to be rooted in one of the tribes from which the country has been constituted over time - English, Welsh, Scottish, Jews - and for immigrants, India, Nigeria or Barbados.Even if we want to make Britishness more assertive and conservative or even to harden it into a citizenship test, it won't wash. One of the reasons Euroscepticism is so difficult to counter in Britain is that beyond the shared political symbols of British sovereignty there's not much more that's common to the story - which is why sovereignty counts so much.You can tell a story of Britain that is about Gray's Elegy, the James I Bible, D-Day and Elgar; or you can tell a story of Britain about the Levellers, Methodists, Monty Python and Willam Wallace. The idea encompasses multiple traditions, stories, tribes and eccentricities; belonging means little more than speaking the language, recognising the complexities and achievements while acknowledging the minimal rules that flow from the political arrangements. The tolerance is in the DNA.The problem for Pakistanis, Eritreans and Somalians is that the tribe to which they emotionally belong within the British accommodation does not command anything like the same loyalty as being British English, British Indian or even British Jamaican. Being British and English, or British and Indian works; being British Pakistani or Eritrean does not. They come from broken-backed countries that have no proud history, culture or identity - Pakistan, for example, is only 58 years old: the identity that makes more proud sense is Islam. And in one jump young British Muslim Somalians, Eritreans and Pakistanis are suddenly in the vortex of a culture and religion profoundly wounded by globalisation, Western foreign policy and its own failure to match the rise of Christendom - with all its capacity to transmute a doctrine of peace into a doctrine of sexism, murder and anti-semitism.Nobody can be sure how it will end, but trying to concoct a new urgent conservative British faith as part of a concerted effort to persuade young British Muslims of the value of their adopted country will not be part of any solution - however much some may wish it. Britishness does not admit of such manipulation, which is why millions of British are so loyal to the idea even while not being overtly loud about it. What will happen, I suspect, is that the British will carry on with their understated Britishness while keeping the invitation open - even to jihadist-inclined British Muslims whose parents came from Eritrea, Somalia and Pakistan - to join the club because in the end, however sorely tempted we are, the invitation can't be withdrawn.It's not how British identity is emotionally constituted. And enough British Muslims will find the same value in the co-existing identities to resist the temptations of jihad, and to marginalize the wannabe murderers in their midst. Indeed, it may be in Britain that radical Islam meets its match; and where Islam starts to convert to modernity. Long odds, maybe - but not impossible."
1,"He could have been almost anything he wanted for at least two or three productive decades. He could have had a career, made a name in his own right as uncle Linley has done, used the education bought for him at high price and the intelligence that came to him naturally. But instead he did the boring, banal thing. He chose what his younger brother - the one with the overworked elbow and dodgy A-level in art - had done only a few months ago. He opted for Sandhurst and a man's half-life in an army uniform.Thus the 23-year-old who would, sooner or later, be king faces a well-trodden few weeks of publicity. No beer, much relentless exercise. No sex or even trysts with Kate. Much yomping and early rising of the kind his dad remembers from Gordonstoun. It's routine publicity as the student prince turns to warrior prince for compact headline purposes. But it is also a dreadful waste of talent, another bumpy ride down the same rutted royal track.William, remember, is monarchy's last best hope: young, handsome, dashing, romantic. Most young voters, duly polled, would like him to be the next in line, the one who leaves his father alone in Highgrove to enjoy a leftover life of waiting in vain. Give us our media star asap!It won't happen, of course. Hereditary monarchies that start skipping generations for marketing's sake are signing their own death warrant. The Queen will not retire. She must go on and on. So, when his moment comes, must King Charles. And then, eventually, there is William.He will be 40 going on 50, or more. The David Cameron aura will have faded away, just like his hairline. Romance will have had its definitive day. This is James Hewitt territory with a twist of Charles Ingram added for millionaire luck. Mum always fancied chaps in uniform, we'll be told a hundred times. The throne, in extremis, will be saved or sunk by some ageing ex-Guards officer who relinquished a proper public profile for years when the barrack doors had closed behind him.The entire scenario reeks of defeat and disillusion. It is a very bad idea. Captain Willie Windsor won't live a life where reality bites. He will not - whatever blustering ex-colonels currently claim - be sent to Iraq or anywhere remotely dangerous. (Leave Harry as the only heir in town? You'd be cashiered first.) No, William will lead an active life for the cameras a suitable distance from any action. He will get promotion, but not too much of it. He will fill a recruiting slot. And then, in his middle or late 30s, he will be obliged to do what his father and uncle both did: that is, not very much, retired early, parked in the waiting room of monarchy.William, in sum, will become a killer of time and occasional cutter of ribbons. He can't be promoted too far, a runner of regiments, a power in the Ministry of Defence - because one fine day he'll be notional commander in chief of the whole damned show. He can rise so far but no further. He will be a lofty Guards officer who knows why lowlier guardsmen must keep their place. And then, like the Duke of York or papa for far too long, it will be more waving-and-shaking on Commonwealth circuits. Wills will be shopsoiled goods when his moment finally comes.Of course, the army (or navy or air force) has certain regal benefits for uncertain royals. Its entry requirements are benevolently enforced. It offers the company of other, suitably discreet fellow officers - and the hope that privacy can be protected once the mess bar is open. It provides a blameless, patriotic way of filling in a gap decade. But none of this is enough, not remotely enough. The army in its upper reaches is cut off from society, not fully part of the nation that must be ruled.Class distinctions and class pursuits still fill the pages of the Tatler. There's no way William can be a people's prince covered in braid as he gallops from polo ground to polo ground. There is no way he can keep in touch - or draw fulfilment from a job where the real rewards of danger and heroism are denied to him.He could have been so many things: a cartographer, using his geography degree; a schoolteacher, helping to shape young lives that would blossom as a legacy long after he'd left; a charity organiser, an Outward Bounder, a businessman learning to manage the Duchy estates in ways his father has never mastered. Even a journalist. He could, in short, have been useful - and signalled that his reign, at last, would be the start of something new, fresh and relevant.But no: the lack of inspiration and imagination is total, perhaps terminal.

Yet any civilised nation, anywhere in the world, would cringe over the punishment we are inflicting on Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Take one dreadful tragedy, stir relentlessly over a decade; then await tragedy renewed.  Some day soon - on an internet website, in a magazine bought at Milan or Madrid airport, after a punch in a pub or a stroke of vile luck - these two 18-year-olds will be ""exposed"". The law is an ass if it thinks that it can guarantee lifelong anonymity to the pair for much over five minutes. What else are ""communities"" but neighbourhoods that watch and talk together?  We may lament such exposure, a continuance of our shame. But big secrets can't be kept forever in a small country. This, more balefully yet, is the old Spycatcher syndrome: judges and politicians don't decide - they have to persuade. And where, pray, is that persuasion?   David Blunkett - at least in the beginning - doesn't even try. He issues one of those the-parole-board-has-informed-me statements which, barely between the lines, says: my hands are tied. The home secretary apparently thinks that holders of his great office, like Michael Howard, avid readers of the tabloids and public-opinion polls are better custodians of juvenile murderers than the judges who heard their cases or the psychologists who have worked to redeem them. European human rights? Forget it. Let's see if we can turn back the clock.  What could his statement - or yesterday's slightly more responsive call for calm - have said?  That here were two kids from fractured, disrupted homes which society - our society - left to fend for themselves. Already victims. They were 10 years old, falling out of the system. They killed a toddler; and the revulsion there is palpable. But what was supposed to happen next? A dose of the junior McVeighs? Obscenely ridiculous. A lifetime behind bars, without hope of release? Barely less obscene. These boys hadn't even had the chance to fail their 11-plus.  Nowhere in mainland Europe is the age of criminal responsibility as low as it is here. Thirteen in Holland, 15 in Denmark, 16 in Spain, 18 in Luxembourg. Anywhere on the continent, Thompson and Venables would not have found themselves in some panoplied crown court listening to men in wigs deciding their fate in language they could not comprehend. They would have been taken away and tended in obscurity - because they were children.  That, in a way, happened here, too. Our secure units are one of the better bits of the system. Robert and Jon have had the care they needed. They have grown up, found themselves and education and remorse. They have come to terms with their malign past. We call it rehabilitation.  Everybody in a position to assess them thinks that they should be released to try to build lives which can never be normal but can, perhaps, be useful and fulfilling. Nobody who knows them today thinks that they should be spun over into adult prisonhood where all the work (and money) invested would surely go to malign waste.  But - David Blunkett could have added - all this patient toil and love stands in pawn today: not from the efforts of those securely inside the unit, but from those outside in the society which first created Thompson and Venables. We dragged them through those adult courts that Europe would despise. We politicians joined the cry for retribution. We judges - like Mr Justice Morland in the case - stripped Child A and Child B of their anonymity so that the flames were fed. We journalists wove the boys of 18 and the kids of 10 into a seamless robe of supposed responsibility. All that was wrong and foolish. We saw the public wrath, the parental grief, and we trembled before it - or rode it out for our own ends. Shame on us.  From that, in turn, inevitably flows the vital factor missing in this equation. Again, ourselves. The courts, which still look inward, clutching their majesty, have ordered lifelong anonymity for these new personalities released into the world.  Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss fears vigilantes hunting two ""uniquely notorious"" lads - ""a real possibility of serious physical harm and possible death from members of the public or from the Bulger family"". Thus the cloaks are cut to cover them while they live. Her injunctions - which may well be doomed because they strain at reality - are only half the story, though.  Lay it out in the clearest terms. This is also our test. So-called ""vigilantes"" are deluded thugs. The pain of the Bulger family is felt but, prolonged indefinitely, it merely builds further tragedy on tragedy. Denise Fergus has other children now: they deserve their normality, too. The memory of Jamie Bulger is best honoured not by vows of eternal revenge, but by closing that door on the past.  The direst test comes not when Thompson and Venables are slipped into the outside world. It comes when, and if, they are discovered. Another media feeding frenzy? More photo-ops for placard wavers? More interviews with outraged neighbours? More politicians hopping up and down and judges eating their dignity?  No: the test is whether, even uncovered, they can be brought to live in peace, to be known but not threatened or ostracised, to be treated for what they have become not what - in childhood - they were. It is a test of our civilisation and our maturity. And leaders who are elected to lead, like home secretaries - should set in directly.  All we have, for the moment, is a dawning of concern (with Ann Widdecombe, to her credit, rather more forthright rather earlier than David Blunkett). But this release is not some neutral act by yet another panel of experts who can be duly excoriated if it goes wrong. It is a decision taken on our behalf because that is the way we have chosen to order our affairs and define our self-image. No ifs, no buts, no facile cop-outs about how five or 10 years more behind bars would have made everyone happier.  Be honest: the time would never have been right. The edge of adulthood is the only point to choose. Heart-searching begins here: and if the home secretary isn't searching hard enough, then the prime minister should be. What's the point of a committed Christian who bites his tongue?"
0,"He could have been almost anything he wanted for at least two or three productive decades. He could have had a career, made a name in his own right as uncle Linley has done, used the education bought for him at high price and the intelligence that came to him naturally. But instead he did the boring, banal thing. He chose what his younger brother - the one with the overworked elbow and dodgy A-level in art - had done only a few months ago. He opted for Sandhurst and a man's half-life in an army uniform.Thus the 23-year-old who would, sooner or later, be king faces a well-trodden few weeks of publicity. No beer, much relentless exercise. No sex or even trysts with Kate. Much yomping and early rising of the kind his dad remembers from Gordonstoun. It's routine publicity as the student prince turns to warrior prince for compact headline purposes. But it is also a dreadful waste of talent, another bumpy ride down the same rutted royal track.William, remember, is monarchy's last best hope: young, handsome, dashing, romantic. Most young voters, duly polled, would like him to be the next in line, the one who leaves his father alone in Highgrove to enjoy a leftover life of waiting in vain. Give us our media star asap!It won't happen, of course. Hereditary monarchies that start skipping generations for marketing's sake are signing their own death warrant. The Queen will not retire. She must go on and on. So, when his moment comes, must King Charles. And then, eventually, there is William.He will be 40 going on 50, or more. The David Cameron aura will have faded away, just like his hairline. Romance will have had its definitive day. This is James Hewitt territory with a twist of Charles Ingram added for millionaire luck. Mum always fancied chaps in uniform, we'll be told a hundred times. The throne, in extremis, will be saved or sunk by some ageing ex-Guards officer who relinquished a proper public profile for years when the barrack doors had closed behind him.The entire scenario reeks of defeat and disillusion. It is a very bad idea. Captain Willie Windsor won't live a life where reality bites. He will not - whatever blustering ex-colonels currently claim - be sent to Iraq or anywhere remotely dangerous. (Leave Harry as the only heir in town? You'd be cashiered first.) No, William will lead an active life for the cameras a suitable distance from any action. He will get promotion, but not too much of it. He will fill a recruiting slot. And then, in his middle or late 30s, he will be obliged to do what his father and uncle both did: that is, not very much, retired early, parked in the waiting room of monarchy.William, in sum, will become a killer of time and occasional cutter of ribbons. He can't be promoted too far, a runner of regiments, a power in the Ministry of Defence - because one fine day he'll be notional commander in chief of the whole damned show. He can rise so far but no further. He will be a lofty Guards officer who knows why lowlier guardsmen must keep their place. And then, like the Duke of York or papa for far too long, it will be more waving-and-shaking on Commonwealth circuits. Wills will be shopsoiled goods when his moment finally comes.Of course, the army (or navy or air force) has certain regal benefits for uncertain royals. Its entry requirements are benevolently enforced. It offers the company of other, suitably discreet fellow officers - and the hope that privacy can be protected once the mess bar is open. It provides a blameless, patriotic way of filling in a gap decade. But none of this is enough, not remotely enough. The army in its upper reaches is cut off from society, not fully part of the nation that must be ruled.Class distinctions and class pursuits still fill the pages of the Tatler. There's no way William can be a people's prince covered in braid as he gallops from polo ground to polo ground. There is no way he can keep in touch - or draw fulfilment from a job where the real rewards of danger and heroism are denied to him.He could have been so many things: a cartographer, using his geography degree; a schoolteacher, helping to shape young lives that would blossom as a legacy long after he'd left; a charity organiser, an Outward Bounder, a businessman learning to manage the Duchy estates in ways his father has never mastered. Even a journalist. He could, in short, have been useful - and signalled that his reign, at last, would be the start of something new, fresh and relevant.But no: the lack of inspiration and imagination is total, perhaps terminal. By the left, now, shuffle slowly towards oblivion ...","The issue is no longer foxhunting. From now on the argument is about the rule of law. I make no secret of my belief that a civilised society should not allow an amusement which has as its object - or at least its known consequence - the death of an animal. If the right to hunt foxes is a question of civil liberties, so is the right to organise bear-baiting and cockfights. But the debate on that subject is about to be concluded - at least in parliament. No doubt, it will go on in the country. That is the way that free societies behave. Foxhunters will, entirely legitimately, attempt to persuade the House of Commons to change its mind. Today's question concerns how they react to the decision when and while it has the force of law.  There are several precedents to guide their conduct. I spent years of my life telling trade unions that there were no such things as ""Tory laws"". Most of the foxhunting fraternity took the same view. Those of us who told Arthur Scargill to respect the will of a democratically elected parliament are entitled to say the same to the masters of assorted hunts. Indeed, we are entitled to ask what so many people asked us when we were part of what was laughingly called the Labour party leadership. Are persons of influence and authority going to set an example by condemning their lawless associates? That is a question the Prince of Wales now needs to answer. Rumours that he will go on hunting, even when it is illegal, are clearly absurd. A prince who knowingly defied the law could not become king. But last week's events still cause him a problem. The upper-class hooligans who invaded the House of Commons are associated with him in the public mind. The newspapers published photographs of them grinning together, and he is a well-known supporter of the cause which prompted their ""invasion"" of the Commons.  While it was still a legal activity, no one could reasonably feel more than distaste for his hunting enthusiasm. Now that it is about to become illegal, he has a duty to tell the more excitable devotees of the chase that they are no more above the law than the miners were. He ought already to have condemned the Hooray Henrys who disrupted the Commons. The Act of Settlement requires him to protect parliament. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt and put his silence down to slow reaction time. If he remains silent when the promised lawlessness begins, it will be generally assumed that he supports the motorway blockades and the trashing of MPs' constituency offices.   No doubt, apologists for the monarchy will say that he should not be dragged into politics. Right, but too late. Thanks to his hooligan associates, he is already part of the political debate. To preserve his constitutional integrity he needs to say that, emotional huntsman though he remains, he accepts the will of parliament and expects all of his putative subjects to do the same. If Charles III makes the same mistake as Charles I, his defiance of parliament will have less spectacular consequences. But its long-term effect on the future of the monarchy might be more damaging.  People who pay parking fines and get caught on speed cameras are likely to be impatient with the notion that foxhunters are a special legal case. That is the cry of every petty criminal who is caught. The Prince of Wales will not increase his popularity by tacitly subscribing to the view that their cause justifies a privileged position which would be denied to the men and women protesting against   an unjust war and was denied to men at Cortonwood colliery who demonstrated against the decision to destroy their livelihoods.  All the emotive arguments in favour of foxhunting could have been applied to mining 20 years ago, with 10 times more force. Jobs were lost. A way of life was sacrificed. A noble part of our history died. The newspapers which are treating the Commons invaders like heroes need to show a little consistency. And the heir to the throne ought to create a few headlines by speaking up for the law.  Neither the Prince of Wales nor the Countryside Alliance can hide behind the demeaning excuse that the hooligans are an unwanted addition the peaceful protests. Grown-ups have to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. We know, as a result of last week's events, that a lawless fringe - blocking roads and throwing flash bombs at police horses - will always hang round the pro-hunt demonstrations, initially peaceful or not. Someone the hunters will listen to has to demand that the law be respected. The Prince of Wales is the ideal candidate for the job - unless he is a secret sympathiser with the people who hold democracy in contempt."
1,"The inquiry evidence is clear enough. There was totally unacceptable violence: ""whipping on the soles of the feet, burning with lighted cigarettes"". Victims had ""leather thongs tied round their necks and were dragged along the ground"". Perhaps 170 more prisoners were involved: at least 32 emerged badly injured. Another case for concern of the kind that besets the MoD in increasing and worrying numbers if weekend reports speak true? No: actually this is the detritus of Northern Tanganyika 1953, when young district officer Brian Hayward and 21 men were dispatched to ""screen"" any wandering Kikuyu who might have crossed colonial borders and brought the infection of Mau Mau with them.  Faded stuff, creeping into irrelevance? Who, you might well ask, cares any longer about the East Africa of half a century ago - or remembers what happened before Nyasaland turned into Malawi? Who, for that matter, gives a moment's thought to the shade of Sir Gerald Templer and the ruthless ways of his Malayan ""emergency""? Mr Gordon Brown, stepping out boldly where only Tony Blair usually goes, tells us to stop apologising for our colonial past. Britain's legacy - of law, freedom and honour - is something to be proud of, even before he opens his chequebook. And that is true, in a way, if truth is a basket of apples. More Metropolitan commissioners of police than I care to contemplate have lectured me over the years about the inevitability of the occasional bad apple. A few cops on the take or a prisoner bruised and battered in his cell? Sorry, but in a force of so many thousand, there are always going to be a few bad Coxes, old boy. It appals us, just like you: but keep it in perspective, please. Don't let isolated horrors taint the dedicated work of the great majority of officers.  That's an utterly reasonable pitch - as obviously valid as the editor of the New York Times claiming one Jayson Blair doesn't make a barrel of rancid cider in his newsroom. But you can't stop there and turn away, for sometimes the tale of the odd rotten apple is also a rotten defence of a rotten regime.  There's the point, for some of us, in repeatedly raising the lessons of Caroline Elkins' new book Britain's Gulag, about the Kenya of the 1950's where tens - maybe hundreds - of thousands of Kikuyu died, where well over a thousand were summarily hanged, where 300,000 or more were thrown in and out of 50 detention camps without trial, sentence or foreseeable end to their ordeal. We don't want to spoil Gordon's breakfast (or stop him becoming foreign secretary, if the travel bug bites again). We simply think that he should eat the whole apple pie.  Nobody, looking back at the final throes of colonial withdrawal, can escape seeing a pattern of events endlessly repeated: too many deaths out of reach of justice, too many cover-ups and self-serving ""reports"" into manifest atrocities, too many ministers back in London washing their hands.  And all because, as Professor Elkins says, the perceived ""bestiality, filth and evil"" of the victims rendered them ""subhuman, and therefore without rights"". These were enemies in war and enemies of civilisation. Anything went for them, just as seemingly, for instance, anything goes in Abu Ghraib.  Putrefying pippins on a bough far out of reach? That is the convenient answer over decades - convenient not just for politicians in a muck sweat, but also for we ordinary Joes who like our squaddies cheery and our coppers honest. We want to believe the best of them. We're horrified when we feel ourselves let down. We bow meekly enough before the word of the Met or Hoon or Rumsfeld. Other countries, to be sure, have their problems.  Remember the French in Algiers or the legions of the lost in Argentina. Remember Auschwitz, Harry. Thank heaven that we, in our civilisation and tolerance, can never slide so far. Thank heaven that all our difficulties, however distressing, are merely apple dumplings.  But it's not good enough any longer: simply not good enough. The reality of the matter, the reality we need to face, is both more complex and more banal. Have awful, and continuingly awful, things gone on at Guantnamo Bay? Of course: the inmates are subhuman makers of terrorist war wallowing in their own filth. And Abu Ghraib? Make that a dismal ditto. And Basra? Well, we'll see what the court martial decides, but every picture tells a story - and didn't an order called Frago152 from Army Legal Services warn commanders that ""detained people should not be assaulted""?  In short, on the British army's own evidence, there was alarm that things might   go disastrously astray once the Iraq war itself was over: the first days of peace were edgy, going on ominous. But where, pray, did this message ""to commanders"" go next? Not, apparently, to some crumbs at the bottom of the basket. Not, in Abu Ghraib, to corporals and privates filling their photo album.  So there we go back once more to the colonies of long ago. Young Hayward served ""three months hard labour"", keeping accounts in a hotel. Guys higher up the chain who'd beaten prisoners into submission got OBE's or Whitehall jobs in intelligence. Nobody important could take the rap because that would suggest the violence was sanctioned.  Now history, eerily, repeats itself (for the little corporal of Abu Ghraib, amongst others). And we have one more chance to learn: not that this or that war was evil, or this or that back deserved to be flogged; not that our boys are better or worse - or that the war itself was right, wrong or indifferent. The lesson says there is no superiority here, nor any bland assumptions of civilisation. The lesson says we can all be subhuman, too.","There's nothing like five weeks in court - as I spent with the Hamiltons - for making you feel utterly puny. Up in the witness box or down with the groundlings, the litany seems the same. ""I can't remember."" ""I have no memory of that."" ""I have no such recollection."" ""I definitely have no such recollection."" What happened five or 10 or 15 years ago? The fogs of forgetfulness fall constantly over witnesses on every side. Dunno. Search me, guv. There's a dreadful truth about human inadequacy lurking here. We're supposed to be men and women of intelligence, summoned to testify with extreme precision. The judge says he lays great store by consistency in detail. But how is such a miraculous state of grace to be produced?  Mr Desmond Browne QC (for the plaintiff) keeps calling Miss Bozak, Miss Bond and vice versa. Two key witnesses; one tongue lock. My wife in the gallery persists in her belief that he's really Dennis Browne. (Some confusion with Dirty Den?) My lord on the bench introduces me solemnly as ""editor of the Guardian for 20 days,"" which would be swift going, even on the old Daily Express.  Memory as the millennium ends seems a suitable subject: intractable in its furthest scientific reaches. The definitive learned journal, Learning and Memory, constantly promises enlightenment. Try the essay on ""the effect of varying the intensity and train frequency of forelimb and cerebelar crossing fiber conditioning stimuli on the latency of conditioned eye-block responses in decerebrate ferrets"". You may be suitably instructed about ""interneurons and food averse conditioning in the slug brain"" but you will find very little that relates to Court 13.  Only, perhaps, Hamann, Cahill, McGough and Squire on ""intact enhancement of declarative memory for emotional material in amnesia,"" which means that, when the team told their forgetful subjects ""emotionally arousing stories"" with video slides attached, the images lingered longer. That is not a shattering conclusion. We assume that it's the high drama of our lives (professional and personal) which defines the scenes we do remember. The death of Kennedy, the moment 10 Christmases ago when Romania was suddenly free: or, closer to home, the births and crises of sickness.  And yet, for me, the most vivid memories are often oddly tangential. I don't remember what my mother said 50 years ago when she told us our father had died. I do remember sitting in the bay window overlooking the lawn a few hours later and seeing his Biro pen and asking whether it could be mine now. ""Yes, of course."" And then feeling selfish and petty and suddenly overcome with grief.  I remember my father in only one moment, when he'd bought another second-hand car (as he did every six months) and was showing me the gears. It was an Opel with a gear shift on the steering wheel. Slam the car door and he is gone. Why is memory so full of shifting sands? I have a good one, but stocked with useless facts. The assorted filmo-graphy of Rhonda Fleming; the real names of Tony Curtis and Walter Matthau. (Bernie Schwarz: Wally Matuschanskayasky).  But it is a particular kind of memory. Faces? I could never have been a politician (or, if so, only David Steel, who once told me he was hopeless at putting names to faces). Those with that gift are kings. I once, after an absence of years, wandered into the Ledra Palace hotel in Nicosia, and there at reception was Pan, the chief concierge. ""Ah, Mr Preston. Nice to see you again."" One face among thousands passing through. He should have been president.  Nor is there the consistency of a whole vision on call. Does such a thing exist? Dennis Potter's Blue Remembered Hills, an evocation of a rural life so complete in its detail, so passionate in its re-creation, that you wondered where memory ended and fiction began. Does any child have the capacity to deliver back intact a world that is decades gone?  I remember the first piece from Bosnia that Maggie O'Kane filed for the Guardian, but when I look through the yellowed cuttings of editorials, I can read a piece and not know that I wrote it. I can remember shaking Richard Nixon's cold, limp hand, but not a sentence that he said. I can remember ripping the agency tape of Harold Wilson's resignation from the wire service, but nothing of the paper that followed.  And family memories are a compilation of all these things, as shared patchwork. My wife remembers with uncanny accuracy what we ate or wore 20 years ago. She remembers where I was when our first son was born (at the office, working) and where when the second son followed (downstairs, boiling water). Things I choose to forget; just, alas, as I choose to let slip the time when she walked down the hill to the hospital, carrying a suitcase, to have our twins induced (I was in the office, working).  Are such omissions an acknowledgement of frailty? Naturally so. The taunting thing about memory is the essential frailty that dogs its every lurch into the past. Sometimes you can recall pivotal scenes which other players have totally forgotten. (I summoned back one in the Hamilton saga). But sometimes the screen mists and fades without explanation. What do I remember of my longest day in war, twice strafed by Indian jets in a Pakistani ditch? I remember cracking my teeth on a metal screw in the ravioli at Flashman's, Rawalpindi.  Goodbye to the old century. We remember it after a fashion. But the most terrifying blight is not to remember it at all. I once had lunch with one of my heroes, Kenneth Millar, the writer Ross MacDonald, whose best-selling pitch was the haunting return of buried evils. Within a couple of years, Alzheimer's destroyed him. It was, and is, the purest tragedy, the annihilation of being. A witness no more: not even a slug or a ferret. A mind full of punctilious richness shut down like a broken computer. Memory full, memory wiped."

In the past week alone, several of the ambitious, thrusting men competing to be Alan Sugar's apprentice on BBC2 cracked under the stress and started welling up. Meanwhile, minor celebrities, worn down by the strain of singing pop duets for Just the Two of Us, similarly shooed away the camera, lest it discover them weeping.Yet the men on another BBC programme remained steadfastly free of tears. In Facing the Truth, victims and perpetrators of violence in Northern Ireland met each other under the gentle gaze of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. They told and heard stories to break the heart, and sometimes their eyes grew moist, but these men did not cry.These remarkable films, shown over three successive nights, prompted a whole range of thoughts. First, they were a reminder of the sheer strangeness of the Troubles. Citizens of this country recalled their campaigns to kill each other; how they saw themselves and their targets as ""soldiers"", how they studied files, drawn up by self-styled ""intelligence officers"", telling them how to track down and murder their quarry. How they did this while pretending to live ordinary lives. Michael Stone, notorious for his 1988 killing spree at Milltown cemetery, used to rub dirt and sand into his clothes so that his wife would think he was a builder. One of his targets drove a Mother's Pride delivery van. Few described it this way at the time, but these programmes left little doubt: on the streets of the United Kingdom, there was a civil war.Facing the Truth prompted a question: why has Northern Ireland not had its own truth and reconciliation commission, analogous to the one Archbishop Tutu chaired in South Africa? Why had it been left to television, to the BBC, to organise one? Watching, it became clear the province needs such a process: there is no shortage of pain or people yearning to bear witness.But the programmes asked a larger question. For what was noticeable in several of the filmed encounters was a subtle, unstated pressure - not on the culprits to show contrition, but on the victims. Those who had lost limbs or loved ones were under pressure - to forgive.Carefully and sensitively, the grieving relatives were led to a climax: how would they close the meeting? Would they be able to reach out and shake the hand of those who had wrought such havoc? There was something uncomfortable about this, for it is part of a larger pressure, not confined to this TV series, which demands that those who have suffered most must also be the most generous.Which is why I feel for the Rev Julie Nicholson, the vicar who has quit her Bristol pulpit because she can no longer preach forgiveness - not after her daughter, Jenny, was killed in the July 7 bombings last year. As a Christian, Nicholson clearly felt under enormous pressure to say she could forgive Mohammed Sidique Khan, who had blown up himself and six others at Edgware Road station. But she could not do it.And now I wonder why we ask such a thing of those who have been bereaved so cruelly. Of course, there are people who are able, somehow, to meet this challenge. The mother of Anthony Walker, the Liverpool teenager murdered by racist thugs wielding an ice axe, somehow emerged from the trial of her son's killers to declare: ""I have got to forgive them. I still forgive them."" Last year the mother of Abigail Witchells, stabbed in front of her toddler child, spoke of her ""enormous sadness"" on hearing of the suicide of her daughter's presumed attacker. She said his death was the ""real tragedy of the story"" - and that she had forgiven him.I confess to being both in awe of and baffled by the compassion of such people. Of course, none of us can know how we would respond to so desperate a plight, but I struggle to understand how you could forgive the killer, or attempted killer, of your own child. I do not know how it would be possible to hold anything in your heart but rage and pain.There are philosophical objections one could muster too. Surely the only person who can forgive a crime is its direct victim: Anthony Walker has the authority to forgive his killers - but he is not here. For believers, I have sympathy with those who say that if forgiveness is in the hands of anybody it is, like judgment, in the hands of God alone.But these are not the prevailing or even popular assumptions. Instead, we exalt those who can forgive and regard those who cannot as guilty of a kind of moral weakness. We demand that those who have been brought low reach highest.There might be a way through this - and it would begin with an attempt to define our terms. Forgiveness has entered casual parlance as a psychological term, shorthand for ""moving on"", for no longer holding a grudge, even for feelings of equanimity or empathy towards the person who hurt you.""If it is that, it can't be done,"" says Giles Fraser, vicar of Putney and author of Christianity and Violence. He dismisses the idea of ""loving"" the man who has harmed you or your family as ""morally perverse, even if I understood what it meant. How could feelings of anger and loss coexist with that love?"" That definition of forgiveness, the one we seem to demand from those who have suffered most, is little more than ""cheap Christian rhetoric"".No, forgiveness should be a much more realistic, pragmatic business. In Fraser's eyes, to forgive someone is merely to vow that you will not respond to their crime in kind. If they have killed, you will not kill back: you will choose instead to end the cycle of violence. On this definition, forgiveness is the literal opposite of revenge.This is a move that is much easier to imagine. Sylvia Hackett, whose husband Dermot was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, has clearly moved beyond wanting to do to Michael Stone what he and his comrades did to her. But on Monday night's programme she seemed to feel that was not enough; she forced herself to walk over to Stone and shake his hand. When he placed a second hand on hers, she recoiled and fled from the room. It was too much. She may not have wanted to kill Stone, but nor did she want to be his friend. Yet our present day notions of forgiveness confuse the two.Not that the eschewing of revenge should be considered something small: it is not forgiveness lite. In most circumstances, we can give up our right to seek direct vengeance in favour of justice: we may not kill the killers, but at least we will see them behind bars. But in some places - Northern Ireland and South Africa among them - there is not even that comfort. Justice has been sacrificed in the pursuit of peace. That is why Michael Stone, originally sentenced to 684 years in jail, is now a free man, released under the Good Friday agreement.So we should alter what we mean by forgiveness. It is not a syrupy inscription in a greetings card; it is a painful, practical step taken by those who want to end the killing. It is not some impossible ideal: it is, properly defined, achievable - and no less admirable for that."
1,"She invited a few of them in for supper the other day - the five surviving prime ministers from her 50 occasionally glorious years. Polite chitchat and photocalls. But what does she really think of them, and their five dead predecessors? How do they and their policies look from her seat in the royal circle? And ""circle"" is the word. The big contortions, of course, are the most obvious. She began with a Conservative PM making statesmanlike speeches about the need for European union (with Britain, as usual, somewhere adjacent to its ventricle regions) and a Labour party viscerally opposed. She winds up five decades later with a Labour PM piping Euro-rhetoric from every available artery and a Conservative would-be prime minister whose hair would stand on end at Churchill's visions, if he had any. (Hair that is, not visions.)  But great upheavals are a natural part of politics: it's the detail of the years from Butler to Byers which is more dismaying. Why, Iain Duncan Smith inquired recently, ""are we still running our public services in the same ways we did after the second world war?"" This is the 21st century, he said. ""We've lived through the cold war, the development of nuclear weapons, the fall of the Berlin wall and the rise of the internet."" But health and education and the rest were still ""Clem Attlee"" stuff, frozen in time and immobility. Or so he seemed to think. In reality the record is far worse than that. It is a long and costly amble round the houses, a potter of constant change in order to get back to where we (and Her Majesty) started.  IDS - because he's Winston's current heir and thinking aloud for his living these days - is the obvious marker for half a century; but, to be honest, new Blairism would serve almost equally well. Just consider...  British education used to be local and wholly devolved, run by school boards in your home town, not ministries in London. The minister of education and his Sir Humphreys could jawbone but not prescribe; they worked - wait for that word again - through ""circulars"" bearing advice from on high. They were rarely taken much notice of.  Who changed all that? A bit of Butler in 1944; a pinch of Crosland through the 60s. But I remember the 80s best, and sitting with Kenneth Baker in his shiny ministerial limo while he explained the wonders of a national curriculum. A pox on sloppy schools and sloppy teachers turning out kids who couldn't read because they and their unions defended failure: a chance, at last, for the centre to demand something better - true equality of opportunity - with means to deliver.  It sounded good. And now? Mr Duncan Smith wants (somewhat mystically) to guarantee equal opportunity another way: by trusting heads and teachers, by getting centralised government and politics out of the act. ""Trusting people is the modern way,"" he says - as opposed to the old way, when we absolutely knew that the people who mattered couldn't be trusted. ""It is organisations operating on a human scale that succeed.""  So, in IDS-speak as well as Milburn-speak, the doctors and nurses become not merely the front men and women of health, but its front line of decision-making again. Just as they were before Elizabeth married Philip, and Nye Bevan, after the most draining of fights with Consultants Incorporated, founded the NHS. Once the NHS answer was centrally set targets delivered by an efficient management (mostly nurses seeking a better salary and career). Then we had trusts and more management. Now we may be going back to men in white coats running everyone's lives   out of their own back pockets. Once we put our faith in waiting lists. Now these are suddenly tawdry devices.  Crime? Bobbies on the beat or in their pandas? Dixon of Dock Green or Z-Cars? We've oscillated back and forth over the years.  Devolution? ""Switzerland is a very small country,"" reveals IDS, ""yet it retains a vibrant and vital local tradition through its cantons."" Does that mean that today's Conservatives want stronger, more independent local administration - Thatcherism in reverse? Er... yes and no. Not ""regional assemblies which don't drive power down from Whitehall but strip it from local communities"". They, apparently, mean ""more centralisation, not less"". Stronger local councils, then, with drastically increased revenue-raising capabilities? Er... no and yes. City mayors like Rudy Giuliani, ""who turned crime around because he had the authority to do so""? Don't begin to explain that.  The difficulty for the Tories is that there's virtually no social policy where they haven't turned turtle (often many times) through the past 50 years. Which secretary of state for education saw the greatest ever number of comprehensive schools created on her watch? Yip, Mrs T, the same lady who put her name to the Single European Act. A life of ever-increasing circularity. And the difficulty for Labour is turning out to be much the same.  Here come the new super-ministries like transport and local government. There, barely a year later, they go again, dragging the remnants of their super-minister with them. Watch our latest patent variant on NHS internal markets come and go and come again. Here's what Roy Jenkins used to believe about penal (and asylum) policy - and here's the Blunkett version.   There is, to be sure, some progress. Once in the 50s, Harold Macmillan made his reputation because he ""built more houses""; now ministers don't ""build"" houses any longer because it's their changed job to make the trains run on time. Once upon a more baleful time, the Ministry of Labour provided the most gruelling test in town; now it is called employment and nobody quite remembers whose wing shelters the remnants.  But on the main events, Your Majesty, on the big intractables like the hegemony of the Treasury that Harold Wilson tried to destroy with his Department of Economic Affairs and a deputy prime minister in charge? Ah! deputy prime ministers. They come and they go, too. The promise is always of progress. The delivery is always best suited to those with short memories and smaller expectations.  Only one thing, it seems, remains constant: occasional republican chuntering about tax holidays for happy monarchs, about duties which pay nothing at death. Willie Hamilton of beloved memory used to sing that song; other paler shadows have taken up his refrain. But nothing happens, Your Majesty, nothing at all. One circle that's never squared.","The inquiry evidence is clear enough. There was totally unacceptable violence: ""whipping on the soles of the feet, burning with lighted cigarettes"". Victims had ""leather thongs tied round their necks and were dragged along the ground"". Perhaps 170 more prisoners were involved: at least 32 emerged badly injured. Another case for concern of the kind that besets the MoD in increasing and worrying numbers if weekend reports speak true? No: actually this is the detritus of Northern Tanganyika 1953, when young district officer Brian Hayward and 21 men were dispatched to ""screen"" any wandering Kikuyu who might have crossed colonial borders and brought the infection of Mau Mau with them.  Faded stuff, creeping into irrelevance? Who, you might well ask, cares any longer about the East Africa of half a century ago - or remembers what happened before Nyasaland turned into Malawi? Who, for that matter, gives a moment's thought to the shade of Sir Gerald Templer and the ruthless ways of his Malayan ""emergency""? Mr Gordon Brown, stepping out boldly where only Tony Blair usually goes, tells us to stop apologising for our colonial past. Britain's legacy - of law, freedom and honour - is something to be proud of, even before he opens his chequebook. And that is true, in a way, if truth is a basket of apples. More Metropolitan commissioners of police than I care to contemplate have lectured me over the years about the inevitability of the occasional bad apple. A few cops on the take or a prisoner bruised and battered in his cell? Sorry, but in a force of so many thousand, there are always going to be a few bad Coxes, old boy. It appals us, just like you: but keep it in perspective, please. Don't let isolated horrors taint the dedicated work of the great majority of officers.  That's an utterly reasonable pitch - as obviously valid as the editor of the New York Times claiming one Jayson Blair doesn't make a barrel of rancid cider in his newsroom. But you can't stop there and turn away, for sometimes the tale of the odd rotten apple is also a rotten defence of a rotten regime.  There's the point, for some of us, in repeatedly raising the lessons of Caroline Elkins' new book Britain's Gulag, about the Kenya of the 1950's where tens - maybe hundreds - of thousands of Kikuyu died, where well over a thousand were summarily hanged, where 300,000 or more were thrown in and out of 50 detention camps without trial, sentence or foreseeable end to their ordeal. We don't want to spoil Gordon's breakfast (or stop him becoming foreign secretary, if the travel bug bites again). We simply think that he should eat the whole apple pie.  Nobody, looking back at the final throes of colonial withdrawal, can escape seeing a pattern of events endlessly repeated: too many deaths out of reach of justice, too many cover-ups and self-serving ""reports"" into manifest atrocities, too many ministers back in London washing their hands.  And all because, as Professor Elkins says, the perceived ""bestiality, filth and evil"" of the victims rendered them ""subhuman, and therefore without rights"". These were enemies in war and enemies of civilisation. Anything went for them, just as seemingly, for instance, anything goes in Abu Ghraib.  Putrefying pippins on a bough far out of reach? That is the convenient answer over decades - convenient not just for politicians in a muck sweat, but also for we ordinary Joes who like our squaddies cheery and our coppers honest. We want to believe the best of them. We're horrified when we feel ourselves let down. We bow meekly enough before the word of the Met or Hoon or Rumsfeld. Other countries, to be sure, have their problems.  Remember the French in Algiers or the legions of the lost in Argentina. Remember Auschwitz, Harry. Thank heaven that we, in our civilisation and tolerance, can never slide so far. Thank heaven that all our difficulties, however distressing, are merely apple dumplings.  But it's not good enough any longer: simply not good enough. The reality of the matter, the reality we need to face, is both more complex and more banal. Have awful, and continuingly awful, things gone on at Guantnamo Bay? Of course: the inmates are subhuman makers of terrorist war wallowing in their own filth. And Abu Ghraib? Make that a dismal ditto. And Basra? Well, we'll see what the court martial decides, but every picture tells a story - and didn't an order called Frago152 from Army Legal Services warn commanders that ""detained people should not be assaulted""?  In short, on the British army's own evidence, there was alarm that things might   go disastrously astray once the Iraq war itself was over: the first days of peace were edgy, going on ominous. But where, pray, did this message ""to commanders"" go next? Not, apparently, to some crumbs at the bottom of the basket. Not, in Abu Ghraib, to corporals and privates filling their photo album.  So there we go back once more to the colonies of long ago. Young Hayward served ""three months hard labour"", keeping accounts in a hotel. Guys higher up the chain who'd beaten prisoners into submission got OBE's or Whitehall jobs in intelligence. Nobody important could take the rap because that would suggest the violence was sanctioned.  Now history, eerily, repeats itself (for the little corporal of Abu Ghraib, amongst others). And we have one more chance to learn: not that this or that war was evil, or this or that back deserved to be flogged; not that our boys are better or worse - or that the war itself was right, wrong or indifferent. The lesson says there is no superiority here, nor any bland assumptions of civilisation. The lesson says we can all be subhuman, too."

One circle that's never squared.","To be honest, I rarely believe the Queen when she addresses the nation; the Christmas number is too much of a duty call, and when she has anything to do with parliament, she always looks slightly sour - as we all would, I'm sure, were we required to endorse absolutely everything, while still pretending to be in charge just to save trouble.When she spoke at the second world war commemoration, though, everything was spot on. You can believe in the debt she feels to the veterans' generation, and the continuing resonance its sacrifices have for her. The only jarring note was this: sandwiched between references to their ""resilience"" and ""courage"" was mention of their ""sense of humour"".I don't think I'm being unfair to her majesty when I say this isn't a language I'd expect her to understand, still less namecheck as a national boon. There is certainly no public record of her ever having made a joke, unless her experiment with crossing the short-legged corgi with the shorter-legged dachshund was actually done in the name of humour. There is likewise no photographic record of her laughing or smiling, apart from when Motivator won the 2005 Derby, earning the monarch ... well, I have no idea what her bet was, but even it was a fairly modest sum, that still leaves a smile related to acquisition, rather than actual mirth.This isn't just blinkered republicanism - there are royals who manifestly have a laugh. Princess Margaret was one; I fancy that Prince Andrew sometimes enjoys a joke or two, albeit of a coarse and obvious nature. I am speculating wildly, but he has the big mouth of a man who likes to laugh.The point is, though, that if you were to find anyone with a solid and expressible sense of British identity, then definitely in their top five, and probably their top two, would be the royal family and A Highly Developed Sense of Humour. There are a number of contradictions here: for a start, our figurehead lacks the one quality that we think recommends us; and the minute you start pontificating on the quality of your humour, it almost certainly rules out the possibility that you have any. But modern nationhood is a complicated business, so you'd expect anomalies.The substance of our fabled wit, as we see it, is this: first, it is much more advanced than any other country's, especially Germany. When people discuss the Blitz spirit, it is very often in terms of the cockney sparrows who lose a leg and then make a hilarious pun about getting legless. We are happy to admit that our bombing of German cities was as devastating as theirs of ours, but we are absolutely determined that it go down in the annals: whoever bombed whom to pieces, we definitely had the most fun. Oh yes. Humour is bound up with pluck and stoicism, as if its prime function were to keep our mouths so occupied with drolleries that moaning and whining were literally impossible.This is something that came out immediately after last week's bombing, a swell of pride in the age-old grit of the Londoner, another bad thing happening without denting our character. It was different to the response in Madrid. The underlying feelings - shock, mourning, sympathy, defiance - were the same, but where they took to the streets to vent them, we have been rigidly business-as-usual.That's not to say that there was an instant cache of tube-bomb jokes circulating over the net - that may happen and it may not. My feeling is that we've all lost our stomachs for the hilarity of breaking the bereavement taboo, which is why disasters such as Beslan or the tsunami spawned nothing like the one-liners they used to.But whether we ever joke about the attack itself is irrelevant. The capital, even by Thursday evening, had its sense of humour back: grim, black and muted it may have been, but the pubs were full. In other cultures, resilience is manifested in dignity and vigil, but here we manifest it exactly as the Queen said: with a sense of humour. We must be OK, because we're ready with our poor wordplay once more.I think this explains why figures such as Ken Livingstone are more welcome in bad times than Tony Blair - not because Ken is incapable of gravitas, but because we know his base register is more skittish and mischievous, closer to the normality we seek instantly to resume.The funny thing is, disasters aren't that funny. Thursday wasn't, and I'm sure the Blitz wasn't exactly a laugh. To take pride in such a response is quirky - but if even the Queen has noticed, it must be true."
1,"There's nothing like five weeks in court - as I spent with the Hamiltons - for making you feel utterly puny. Up in the witness box or down with the groundlings, the litany seems the same. ""I can't remember."" ""I have no memory of that."" ""I have no such recollection."" ""I definitely have no such recollection."" What happened five or 10 or 15 years ago? The fogs of forgetfulness fall constantly over witnesses on every side. Dunno. Search me, guv. There's a dreadful truth about human inadequacy lurking here. We're supposed to be men and women of intelligence, summoned to testify with extreme precision. The judge says he lays great store by consistency in detail. But how is such a miraculous state of grace to be produced?  Mr Desmond Browne QC (for the plaintiff) keeps calling Miss Bozak, Miss Bond and vice versa. Two key witnesses; one tongue lock. My wife in the gallery persists in her belief that he's really Dennis Browne. (Some confusion with Dirty Den?) My lord on the bench introduces me solemnly as ""editor of the Guardian for 20 days,"" which would be swift going, even on the old Daily Express.  Memory as the millennium ends seems a suitable subject: intractable in its furthest scientific reaches. The definitive learned journal, Learning and Memory, constantly promises enlightenment. Try the essay on ""the effect of varying the intensity and train frequency of forelimb and cerebelar crossing fiber conditioning stimuli on the latency of conditioned eye-block responses in decerebrate ferrets"". You may be suitably instructed about ""interneurons and food averse conditioning in the slug brain"" but you will find very little that relates to Court 13.  Only, perhaps, Hamann, Cahill, McGough and Squire on ""intact enhancement of declarative memory for emotional material in amnesia,"" which means that, when the team told their forgetful subjects ""emotionally arousing stories"" with video slides attached, the images lingered longer. That is not a shattering conclusion. We assume that it's the high drama of our lives (professional and personal) which defines the scenes we do remember. The death of Kennedy, the moment 10 Christmases ago when Romania was suddenly free: or, closer to home, the births and crises of sickness.  And yet, for me, the most vivid memories are often oddly tangential. I don't remember what my mother said 50 years ago when she told us our father had died. I do remember sitting in the bay window overlooking the lawn a few hours later and seeing his Biro pen and asking whether it could be mine now. ""Yes, of course."" And then feeling selfish and petty and suddenly overcome with grief.  I remember my father in only one moment, when he'd bought another second-hand car (as he did every six months) and was showing me the gears. It was an Opel with a gear shift on the steering wheel. Slam the car door and he is gone. Why is memory so full of shifting sands? I have a good one, but stocked with useless facts. The assorted filmo-graphy of Rhonda Fleming; the real names of Tony Curtis and Walter Matthau. (Bernie Schwarz: Wally Matuschanskayasky).  But it is a particular kind of memory. Faces? I could never have been a politician (or, if so, only David Steel, who once told me he was hopeless at putting names to faces). Those with that gift are kings. I once, after an absence of years, wandered into the Ledra Palace hotel in Nicosia, and there at reception was Pan, the chief concierge. ""Ah, Mr Preston. Nice to see you again."" One face among thousands passing through. He should have been president.  Nor is there the consistency of a whole vision on call. Does such a thing exist? Dennis Potter's Blue Remembered Hills, an evocation of a rural life so complete in its detail, so passionate in its re-creation, that you wondered where memory ended and fiction began. Does any child have the capacity to deliver back intact a world that is decades gone?  I remember the first piece from Bosnia that Maggie O'Kane filed for the Guardian, but when I look through the yellowed cuttings of editorials, I can read a piece and not know that I wrote it. I can remember shaking Richard Nixon's cold, limp hand, but not a sentence that he said. I can remember ripping the agency tape of Harold Wilson's resignation from the wire service, but nothing of the paper that followed.  And family memories are a compilation of all these things, as shared patchwork. My wife remembers with uncanny accuracy what we ate or wore 20 years ago. She remembers where I was when our first son was born (at the office, working) and where when the second son followed (downstairs, boiling water). Things I choose to forget; just, alas, as I choose to let slip the time when she walked down the hill to the hospital, carrying a suitcase, to have our twins induced (I was in the office, working).  Are such omissions an acknowledgement of frailty? Naturally so. The taunting thing about memory is the essential frailty that dogs its every lurch into the past. Sometimes you can recall pivotal scenes which other players have totally forgotten. (I summoned back one in the Hamilton saga). But sometimes the screen mists and fades without explanation. What do I remember of my longest day in war, twice strafed by Indian jets in a Pakistani ditch? I remember cracking my teeth on a metal screw in the ravioli at Flashman's, Rawalpindi.  Goodbye to the old century. We remember it after a fashion. But the most terrifying blight is not to remember it at all. I once had lunch with one of my heroes, Kenneth Millar, the writer Ross MacDonald, whose best-selling pitch was the haunting return of buried evils. Within a couple of years, Alzheimer's destroyed him. It was, and is, the purest tragedy, the annihilation of being. A witness no more: not even a slug or a ferret. A mind full of punctilious richness shut down like a broken computer. Memory full, memory wiped.","The inquiry evidence is clear enough. There was totally unacceptable violence: ""whipping on the soles of the feet, burning with lighted cigarettes"".

It appals us, just like you: but keep it in perspective, please. Don't let isolated horrors taint the dedicated work of the great majority of officers.  That's an utterly reasonable pitch - as obviously valid as the editor of the New York Times claiming one Jayson Blair doesn't make a barrel of rancid cider in his newsroom. But you can't stop there and turn away, for sometimes the tale of the odd rotten apple is also a rotten defence of a rotten regime.  There's the point, for some of us, in repeatedly raising the lessons of Caroline Elkins' new book Britain's Gulag, about the Kenya of the 1950's where tens - maybe hundreds - of thousands of Kikuyu died, where well over a thousand were summarily hanged, where 300,000 or more were thrown in and out of 50 detention camps without trial, sentence or foreseeable end to their ordeal. We don't want to spoil Gordon's breakfast (or stop him becoming foreign secretary, if the travel bug bites again). We simply think that he should eat the whole apple pie.  Nobody, looking back at the final throes of colonial withdrawal, can escape seeing a pattern of events endlessly repeated: too many deaths out of reach of justice, too many cover-ups and self-serving ""reports"" into manifest atrocities, too many ministers back in London washing their hands.  And all because, as Professor Elkins says, the perceived ""bestiality, filth and evil"" of the victims rendered them ""subhuman, and therefore without rights"". These were enemies in war and enemies of civilisation. Anything went for them, just as seemingly, for instance, anything goes in Abu Ghraib.  Putrefying pippins on a bough far out of reach? That is the convenient answer over decades - convenient not just for politicians in a muck sweat, but also for we ordinary Joes who like our squaddies cheery and our coppers honest. We want to believe the best of them. We're horrified when we feel ourselves let down. We bow meekly enough before the word of the Met or Hoon or Rumsfeld. Other countries, to be sure, have their problems.  Remember the French in Algiers or the legions of the lost in Argentina. Remember Auschwitz, Harry. Thank heaven that we, in our civilisation and tolerance, can never slide so far. Thank heaven that all our difficulties, however distressing, are merely apple dumplings.  But it's not good enough any longer: simply not good enough. The reality of the matter, the reality we need to face, is both more complex and more banal. Have awful, and continuingly awful, things gone on at Guantnamo Bay? Of course: the inmates are subhuman makers of terrorist war wallowing in their own filth. And Abu Ghraib? Make that a dismal ditto. And Basra? Well, we'll see what the court martial decides, but every picture tells a story - and didn't an order called Frago152 from Army Legal Services warn commanders that ""detained people should not be assaulted""?  In short, on the British army's own evidence, there was alarm that things might   go disastrously astray once the Iraq war itself was over: the first days of peace were edgy, going on ominous. But where, pray, did this message ""to commanders"" go next? Not, apparently, to some crumbs at the bottom of the basket. Not, in Abu Ghraib, to corporals and privates filling their photo album.  So there we go back once more to the colonies of long ago. Young Hayward served ""three months hard labour"", keeping accounts in a hotel. Guys higher up the chain who'd beaten prisoners into submission got OBE's or Whitehall jobs in intelligence. Nobody important could take the rap because that would suggest the violence was sanctioned.  Now history, eerily, repeats itself (for the little corporal of Abu Ghraib, amongst others). And we have one more chance to learn: not that this or that war was evil, or this or that back deserved to be flogged; not that our boys are better or worse - or that the war itself was right, wrong or indifferent. The lesson says there is no superiority here, nor any bland assumptions of civilisation. The lesson says we can all be subhuman, too."
0,"There's nothing like five weeks in court - as I spent with the Hamiltons - for making you feel utterly puny. Up in the witness box or down with the groundlings, the litany seems the same. ""I can't remember."" ""I have no memory of that."" ""I have no such recollection."" ""I definitely have no such recollection."" What happened five or 10 or 15 years ago? The fogs of forgetfulness fall constantly over witnesses on every side. Dunno. Search me, guv. There's a dreadful truth about human inadequacy lurking here. We're supposed to be men and women of intelligence, summoned to testify with extreme precision. The judge says he lays great store by consistency in detail. But how is such a miraculous state of grace to be produced?  Mr Desmond Browne QC (for the plaintiff) keeps calling Miss Bozak, Miss Bond and vice versa. Two key witnesses; one tongue lock. My wife in the gallery persists in her belief that he's really Dennis Browne. (Some confusion with Dirty Den?) My lord on the bench introduces me solemnly as ""editor of the Guardian for 20 days,"" which would be swift going, even on the old Daily Express.  Memory as the millennium ends seems a suitable subject: intractable in its furthest scientific reaches. The definitive learned journal, Learning and Memory, constantly promises enlightenment. Try the essay on ""the effect of varying the intensity and train frequency of forelimb and cerebelar crossing fiber conditioning stimuli on the latency of conditioned eye-block responses in decerebrate ferrets"". You may be suitably instructed about ""interneurons and food averse conditioning in the slug brain"" but you will find very little that relates to Court 13.  Only, perhaps, Hamann, Cahill, McGough and Squire on ""intact enhancement of declarative memory for emotional material in amnesia,"" which means that, when the team told their forgetful subjects ""emotionally arousing stories"" with video slides attached, the images lingered longer. That is not a shattering conclusion. We assume that it's the high drama of our lives (professional and personal) which defines the scenes we do remember. The death of Kennedy, the moment 10 Christmases ago when Romania was suddenly free: or, closer to home, the births and crises of sickness.  And yet, for me, the most vivid memories are often oddly tangential. I don't remember what my mother said 50 years ago when she told us our father had died. I do remember sitting in the bay window overlooking the lawn a few hours later and seeing his Biro pen and asking whether it could be mine now. ""Yes, of course."" And then feeling selfish and petty and suddenly overcome with grief.  I remember my father in only one moment, when he'd bought another second-hand car (as he did every six months) and was showing me the gears. It was an Opel with a gear shift on the steering wheel. Slam the car door and he is gone. Why is memory so full of shifting sands? I have a good one, but stocked with useless facts. The assorted filmo-graphy of Rhonda Fleming; the real names of Tony Curtis and Walter Matthau. (Bernie Schwarz: Wally Matuschanskayasky).  But it is a particular kind of memory. Faces? I could never have been a politician (or, if so, only David Steel, who once told me he was hopeless at putting names to faces). Those with that gift are kings. I once, after an absence of years, wandered into the Ledra Palace hotel in Nicosia, and there at reception was Pan, the chief concierge. ""Ah, Mr Preston. Nice to see you again."" One face among thousands passing through. He should have been president.  Nor is there the consistency of a whole vision on call. Does such a thing exist? Dennis Potter's Blue Remembered Hills, an evocation of a rural life so complete in its detail, so passionate in its re-creation, that you wondered where memory ended and fiction began. Does any child have the capacity to deliver back intact a world that is decades gone?  I remember the first piece from Bosnia that Maggie O'Kane filed for the Guardian, but when I look through the yellowed cuttings of editorials, I can read a piece and not know that I wrote it. I can remember shaking Richard Nixon's cold, limp hand, but not a sentence that he said. I can remember ripping the agency tape of Harold Wilson's resignation from the wire service, but nothing of the paper that followed.  And family memories are a compilation of all these things, as shared patchwork. My wife remembers with uncanny accuracy what we ate or wore 20 years ago. She remembers where I was when our first son was born (at the office, working) and where when the second son followed (downstairs, boiling water). Things I choose to forget; just, alas, as I choose to let slip the time when she walked down the hill to the hospital, carrying a suitcase, to have our twins induced (I was in the office, working).  Are such omissions an acknowledgement of frailty? Naturally so. The taunting thing about memory is the essential frailty that dogs its every lurch into the past. Sometimes you can recall pivotal scenes which other players have totally forgotten. (I summoned back one in the Hamilton saga). But sometimes the screen mists and fades without explanation. What do I remember of my longest day in war, twice strafed by Indian jets in a Pakistani ditch? I remember cracking my teeth on a metal screw in the ravioli at Flashman's, Rawalpindi.  Goodbye to the old century. We remember it after a fashion. But the most terrifying blight is not to remember it at all. I once had lunch with one of my heroes, Kenneth Millar, the writer Ross MacDonald, whose best-selling pitch was the haunting return of buried evils. Within a couple of years, Alzheimer's destroyed him. It was, and is, the purest tragedy, the annihilation of being. A witness no more: not even a slug or a ferret. A mind full of punctilious richness shut down like a broken computer. Memory full, memory wiped.","A few days ago, after a furious argument, I was thrown out of a wood where I have walked for more than 20 years. I must admit that I did not behave very well. As I walked away I did something I haven't done for a long time: I gave the gamekeeper a one-fingered salute. In my defence, I would plead that I was overcome with unhappiness and anger.The time I have spent in that wood must amount to months. Every autumn I would spend days there, watching the turning colours or grubbing for mushrooms and beechmast and knapped flints. In the summer I would look for warblers and redstarts. I saw a nightjar there once. It is one of the few peaceful and beautiful places in my part of the world that's within a couple of miles of a station: I could escape from the traffic without the help of a car. Part of me, I feel, belongs there. Or it did.It is not that I wasn't trespassing before. Nor has the status of the land changed: it is still owned, as far as I know, by the same private estate. No one tried to stop me in those 20-odd years because no one was there. But now there is a blue plastic barrel every 50 metres, and the surrounding fields are planted with millet and maize. The wood has been turned into a pheasant run. Having scarcely figured in the landowner's books, it must now be making him a fortune. And I am perceived as a threat.The words that rang in my ears as I stomped away were these: ""You've got your bloody right to roam now - why do you need to come here?"" It struck me that this could be a perverse outcome of the legislation for which I spent years campaigning: that the right to walk in certain places is seen by landowners as consolidating their relations with the public. All that is not permitted will become forbidden.But this, I expect, is a secondary problem. The more important one is surely the surge of money foaming through the south-east of England. A thousand woods can be filled with pheasants and still there are not enough to serve the people who have the money required - the many hundreds of pounds a day - to shoot them. We were told that the rising tide would lift all boats. But I feel I am drowning in it.Two weeks ago, writing in the Financial Times, the economist Andrew Oswald observed that ""the hippies, the greens, the road protesters, the downshifters, the slow-food movement - all are having their quiet revenge. Routinely derided, the ideas of these down-to-earth philosophers are being confirmed by new statistical work by psychologists and economists."" As I qualify on most counts, I will regard this as a vindication.Oswald's point is that the industrialised countries have not become happier as they've become richer. Rates of depression and stress have risen, and people report no greater degree of satisfaction with their lives than their poorer ancestors did. In the US, the sense of wellbeing has actually declined. One of the problems is that ""humans are creatures of comparison ... it is relative income that matters: when everyone in a society gets wealthier, average wellbeing stays the same.""The same point has been made recently by the New Economics Foundation and by Professor Richard Layard in his book Happiness. New developments in psychological testing and neurobiology allow happiness to be measured with greater confidence than before. Layard cites research that suggests that it peaked in the UK in 1975. Beyond a certain degree of wealth - an average GDP of around $20,000 per head - ""additional income is not associated with extra happiness"". Once a society's basic needs and comforts have been met, there is no point in becoming richer.I am astonished by the astonishment with which their findings have been received. Compare, for example, these two statements:""So one secret of happiness is to ignore comparisons with people who are more successful than you are: always compare downwards, not upwards."" Richard Layard, 2005.""It put me to reflecting, how little repining there would be among mankind, at any condition of life, if people would rather compare their condition with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings."" Daniel Defoe, 1719.We have been led, by the thinking of people such as the psychologist John Watson and the economist Lionel Robbins, to forget what everyone once knew: that wealth and happiness are not the same thing.Comparison is not the only reason the professors of happiness cite for our failure to feel better as we become richer. They point to the fact that we become habituated to wealth: Layard calls this ""the hedonic treadmill"". They blame the longer hours we work and our deteriorating relationships. But there is something I think they have missed: that wealth itself can become a source of deprivation.Having money enhances your freedom. You can travel further and you can do more when you get there. But other people's money restricts your freedom. Where you once felt free, now you find fences. In fact, you must travel further to find somewhere in which you can be free.As people become richer, and as they can extract more wealth from their property, other people become more threatening to them. We know that the fear of crime is a cause of unhappiness, but so is the sense of being seen as a potential criminal. The spikes and lights and cameras proclaim that society is not to be trusted, that we live in a world of Hobbesian relations. The story they tell becomes true, as property paranoia makes us hate each other. The harmless wanderer in the woods becomes a mortal enemy.It is hard to see how that plague of pheasants could be deemed to have caused a net increase in happiness. A group of very wealthy people, who already have an endless choice of activities, have one more wood in which to shoot. The rest of us have one less wood in which to walk. The landowners tell us that by putting down birds they have an incentive to preserve the woods - this was one of the arguments the gamekeeper used as he was throwing me off. But what good does that do us if we are not allowed to walk there?The Countryside and Rights of Way Act of 2000, which granted us the right to roam on mountains, moors, heath, downland and commons, has surely increased the sum of human happiness. But in those parts of the country that retain very little habitat of that kind (because it has been destroyed or enclosed by the land- owners), the gains we made then might already have been cancelled out by the losses, as the landlords' new opportunities for making money reduce our opportunities for leaving money behind.We need the full set of rights we were once promised, and which, in Scotland, have already been granted: access to the woods, the rivers and the coast as well as the open country. But as these places are turned into money-making monocultures, the question changes. Will we still want to visit them?"
1,"The News of the World heaves with self-righteous anger. Mr Richard Desmond's fine Daily Star bathes in fury. The words of James Bulger's mother Denise are spread large across every sheet and TV station in the land: ""I know that no matter where they go, someone out there is waiting."" It is difficult not to feel ashamed of this country. We tut-tut, pruriently horrified, over the public execution of Timothy McVeigh. Our landslide prime minister joins with other EU luminaries to wag a consolidated finger at George Bush's punishing beliefs. Yet any civilised nation, anywhere in the world, would cringe over the punishment we are inflicting on Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Take one dreadful tragedy, stir relentlessly over a decade; then await tragedy renewed.  Some day soon - on an internet website, in a magazine bought at Milan or Madrid airport, after a punch in a pub or a stroke of vile luck - these two 18-year-olds will be ""exposed"". The law is an ass if it thinks that it can guarantee lifelong anonymity to the pair for much over five minutes. What else are ""communities"" but neighbourhoods that watch and talk together?  We may lament such exposure, a continuance of our shame. But big secrets can't be kept forever in a small country. This, more balefully yet, is the old Spycatcher syndrome: judges and politicians don't decide - they have to persuade. And where, pray, is that persuasion?   David Blunkett - at least in the beginning - doesn't even try. He issues one of those the-parole-board-has-informed-me statements which, barely between the lines, says: my hands are tied. The home secretary apparently thinks that holders of his great office, like Michael Howard, avid readers of the tabloids and public-opinion polls are better custodians of juvenile murderers than the judges who heard their cases or the psychologists who have worked to redeem them. European human rights? Forget it. Let's see if we can turn back the clock.  What could his statement - or yesterday's slightly more responsive call for calm - have said?  That here were two kids from fractured, disrupted homes which society - our society - left to fend for themselves. Already victims. They were 10 years old, falling out of the system. They killed a toddler; and the revulsion there is palpable. But what was supposed to happen next? A dose of the junior McVeighs? Obscenely ridiculous. A lifetime behind bars, without hope of release? Barely less obscene. These boys hadn't even had the chance to fail their 11-plus.  Nowhere in mainland Europe is the age of criminal responsibility as low as it is here. Thirteen in Holland, 15 in Denmark, 16 in Spain, 18 in Luxembourg. Anywhere on the continent, Thompson and Venables would not have found themselves in some panoplied crown court listening to men in wigs deciding their fate in language they could not comprehend. They would have been taken away and tended in obscurity - because they were children.  That, in a way, happened here, too. Our secure units are one of the better bits of the system. Robert and Jon have had the care they needed. They have grown up, found themselves and education and remorse. They have come to terms with their malign past. We call it rehabilitation.  Everybody in a position to assess them thinks that they should be released to try to build lives which can never be normal but can, perhaps, be useful and fulfilling. Nobody who knows them today thinks that they should be spun over into adult prisonhood where all the work (and money) invested would surely go to malign waste.  But - David Blunkett could have added - all this patient toil and love stands in pawn today: not from the efforts of those securely inside the unit, but from those outside in the society which first created Thompson and Venables. We dragged them through those adult courts that Europe would despise. We politicians joined the cry for retribution. We judges - like Mr Justice Morland in the case - stripped Child A and Child B of their anonymity so that the flames were fed. We journalists wove the boys of 18 and the kids of 10 into a seamless robe of supposed responsibility. All that was wrong and foolish. We saw the public wrath, the parental grief, and we trembled before it - or rode it out for our own ends. Shame on us.  From that, in turn, inevitably flows the vital factor missing in this equation. Again, ourselves. The courts, which still look inward, clutching their majesty, have ordered lifelong anonymity for these new personalities released into the world.  Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss fears vigilantes hunting two ""uniquely notorious"" lads - ""a real possibility of serious physical harm and possible death from members of the public or from the Bulger family"". Thus the cloaks are cut to cover them while they live. Her injunctions - which may well be doomed because they strain at reality - are only half the story, though.  Lay it out in the clearest terms. This is also our test. So-called ""vigilantes"" are deluded thugs. The pain of the Bulger family is felt but, prolonged indefinitely, it merely builds further tragedy on tragedy. Denise Fergus has other children now: they deserve their normality, too. The memory of Jamie Bulger is best honoured not by vows of eternal revenge, but by closing that door on the past.  The direst test comes not when Thompson and Venables are slipped into the outside world. It comes when, and if, they are discovered. Another media feeding frenzy? More photo-ops for placard wavers? More interviews with outraged neighbours? More politicians hopping up and down and judges eating their dignity?  No: the test is whether, even uncovered, they can be brought to live in peace, to be known but not threatened or ostracised, to be treated for what they have become not what - in childhood - they were. It is a test of our civilisation and our maturity. And leaders who are elected to lead, like home secretaries - should set in directly.  All we have, for the moment, is a dawning of concern (with Ann Widdecombe, to her credit, rather more forthright rather earlier than David Blunkett). But this release is not some neutral act by yet another panel of experts who can be duly excoriated if it goes wrong. It is a decision taken on our behalf because that is the way we have chosen to order our affairs and define our self-image. No ifs, no buts, no facile cop-outs about how five or 10 years more behind bars would have made everyone happier.  Be honest: the time would never have been right. The edge of adulthood is the only point to choose. Heart-searching begins here: and if the home secretary isn't searching hard enough, then the prime minister should be. What's the point of a committed Christian who bites his tongue?","She invited a few of them in for supper the other day - the five surviving prime ministers from her 50 occasionally glorious years. Polite chitchat and photocalls. But what does she really think of them, and their five dead predecessors? How do they and their policies look from her seat in the royal circle? And ""circle"" is the word. The big contortions, of course, are the most obvious. She began with a Conservative PM making statesmanlike speeches about the need for European union (with Britain, as usual, somewhere adjacent to its ventricle regions) and a Labour party viscerally opposed. She winds up five decades later with a Labour PM piping Euro-rhetoric from every available artery and a Conservative would-be prime minister whose hair would stand on end at Churchill's visions, if he had any. (Hair that is, not visions.)  But great upheavals are a natural part of politics: it's the detail of the years from Butler to Byers which is more dismaying. Why, Iain Duncan Smith inquired recently, ""are we still running our public services in the same ways we did after the second world war?"" This is the 21st century, he said. ""We've lived through the cold war, the development of nuclear weapons, the fall of the Berlin wall and the rise of the internet."" But health and education and the rest were still ""Clem Attlee"" stuff, frozen in time and immobility. Or so he seemed to think. In reality the record is far worse than that. It is a long and costly amble round the houses, a potter of constant change in order to get back to where we (and Her Majesty) started.  IDS - because he's Winston's current heir and thinking aloud for his living these days - is the obvious marker for half a century; but, to be honest, new Blairism would serve almost equally well. Just consider...  British education used to be local and wholly devolved, run by school boards in your home town, not ministries in London. The minister of education and his Sir Humphreys could jawbone but not prescribe; they worked - wait for that word again - through ""circulars"" bearing advice from on high. They were rarely taken much notice of.  Who changed all that? A bit of Butler in 1944; a pinch of Crosland through the 60s. But I remember the 80s best, and sitting with Kenneth Baker in his shiny ministerial limo while he explained the wonders of a national curriculum. A pox on sloppy schools and sloppy teachers turning out kids who couldn't read because they and their unions defended failure: a chance, at last, for the centre to demand something better - true equality of opportunity - with means to deliver.  It sounded good. And now? Mr Duncan Smith wants (somewhat mystically) to guarantee equal opportunity another way: by trusting heads and teachers, by getting centralised government and politics out of the act. ""Trusting people is the modern way,"" he says - as opposed to the old way, when we absolutely knew that the people who mattered couldn't be trusted. ""It is organisations operating on a human scale that succeed.""  So, in IDS-speak as well as Milburn-speak, the doctors and nurses become not merely the front men and women of health, but its front line of decision-making again. Just as they were before Elizabeth married Philip, and Nye Bevan, after the most draining of fights with Consultants Incorporated, founded the NHS. Once the NHS answer was centrally set targets delivered by an efficient management (mostly nurses seeking a better salary and career). Then we had trusts and more management. Now we may be going back to men in white coats running everyone's lives   out of their own back pockets. Once we put our faith in waiting lists. Now these are suddenly tawdry devices.  Crime? Bobbies on the beat or in their pandas? Dixon of Dock Green or Z-Cars? We've oscillated back and forth over the years.  Devolution? ""Switzerland is a very small country,"" reveals IDS, ""yet it retains a vibrant and vital local tradition through its cantons."" Does that mean that today's Conservatives want stronger, more independent local administration - Thatcherism in reverse? Er... yes and no. Not ""regional assemblies which don't drive power down from Whitehall but strip it from local communities"". They, apparently, mean ""more centralisation, not less"". Stronger local councils, then, with drastically increased revenue-raising capabilities? Er... no and yes. City mayors like Rudy Giuliani, ""who turned crime around because he had the authority to do so""? Don't begin to explain that.  The difficulty for the Tories is that there's virtually no social policy where they haven't turned turtle (often many times) through the past 50 years. Which secretary of state for education saw the greatest ever number of comprehensive schools created on her watch? Yip, Mrs T, the same lady who put her name to the Single European Act. A life of ever-increasing circularity. And the difficulty for Labour is turning out to be much the same.  Here come the new super-ministries like transport and local government. There, barely a year later, they go again, dragging the remnants of their super-minister with them. Watch our latest patent variant on NHS internal markets come and go and come again. Here's what Roy Jenkins used to believe about penal (and asylum) policy - and here's the Blunkett version.   There is, to be sure, some progress. Once in the 50s, Harold Macmillan made his reputation because he ""built more houses""; now ministers don't ""build"" houses any longer because it's their changed job to make the trains run on time. Once upon a more baleful time, the Ministry of Labour provided the most gruelling test in town; now it is called employment and nobody quite remembers whose wing shelters the remnants.  But on the main events, Your Majesty, on the big intractables like the hegemony of the Treasury that Harold Wilson tried to destroy with his Department of Economic Affairs and a deputy prime minister in charge? Ah! deputy prime ministers. They come and they go, too. The promise is always of progress. The delivery is always best suited to those with short memories and smaller expectations.  Only one thing, it seems, remains constant: occasional republican chuntering about tax holidays for happy monarchs, about duties which pay nothing at death. Willie Hamilton of beloved memory used to sing that song; other paler shadows have taken up his refrain. But nothing happens, Your Majesty, nothing at all. One circle that's never squared."

Denise Fergus has other children now: they deserve their normality, too. The memory of Jamie Bulger is best honoured not by vows of eternal revenge, but by closing that door on the past.  The direst test comes not when Thompson and Venables are slipped into the outside world. It comes when, and if, they are discovered. Another media feeding frenzy? More photo-ops for placard wavers? More interviews with outraged neighbours? More politicians hopping up and down and judges eating their dignity?  No: the test is whether, even uncovered, they can be brought to live in peace, to be known but not threatened or ostracised, to be treated for what they have become not what - in childhood - they were. It is a test of our civilisation and our maturity. And leaders who are elected to lead, like home secretaries - should set in directly.  All we have, for the moment, is a dawning of concern (with Ann Widdecombe, to her credit, rather more forthright rather earlier than David Blunkett). But this release is not some neutral act by yet another panel of experts who can be duly excoriated if it goes wrong. It is a decision taken on our behalf because that is the way we have chosen to order our affairs and define our self-image. No ifs, no buts, no facile cop-outs about how five or 10 years more behind bars would have made everyone happier.  Be honest: the time would never have been right. The edge of adulthood is the only point to choose. Heart-searching begins here: and if the home secretary isn't searching hard enough, then the prime minister should be. What's the point of a committed Christian who bites his tongue?","It's a tough call for the policemen in charge of royal protection on the occasion of the family's big shindig. On the one hand, if the amiable hippies in charge of Glastonbury can get their heads around a ticket-only entry system, law enforcement officers of far more advanced jobsworth tendencies should have been able to prevent the gatecrash coup of a comedian dressed as a well-known terrorist. And yet, on the other hand, imagine the conversation - ""I have a man here, sarge, dressed as Osama bin Laden."" ""That's no good. Where's the fun in that?"" ""Well, given that the right-thinking individual doesn't find terrorism in any way amusing, I imagine the joke is that Johnny Foreigner is a funny fellow."" ""Oh, I see, well you'd better let him in, then. That's the theme of the   party."" ""Is that what Out of Africa means?"" ""Yup. Pretty much."" In a craven attempt to get some goods on William's sex life, certain newspapers have decided that his fancy dress idea derives from the hots he harbours for Jessica Craig. According to the Sunday Times, she is a 21-year-old member of ""Kenya's white elite"", though whether you can ascend into this white elite just by being white, or whether you have to be loaded as well, remains unclear (lest there be any doubt, however, she is also loaded).  The historian Andrew Roberts considers the theme as part of the wider family's relationship with the African continent. ""There is an inverse proportion between the amount of time the Windsors spend in Africa and the amount of power they have   there. After decolonisation, they went more and more."" I suppose the message there is that this is a very nice family which just gets along much better with people it is not actively oppressing. The party theme is therefore a loud hello to celebrate the end of a pernicious empire. But really, to interpret this as either a romantic or a political gesture is to back away from the glaring truth that this is party theming as devised by a complete arse.  First, although no reports have been exhaustive on the subject of Will's guest list, all the people who have been mentioned seem to have names that start with Second Earl of ... I wouldn't want to embarrass the palace by checking, but I am prepared to bet that the only black people at the party   were members of the band. While nobody can force a young Botswana-travelled royal to have African acquaintances who are not members of its ""white elite"", the act of making his whitey friends dress up in feathers rather tastelessly underlines the fact. After all, you probably wouldn't have an American-themed party if you had Americans you wanted to invite. They would turn up in their regular clothes, for one thing, and besides, might experience feelings of miffedness.  Imagine if someone in Africa had an English-themed party. There would be a lot of top hats and fans; some Jane Austen wear for people prepared to make the effort; a few wags might arrive with fake 12-bores and try to subjugate the rest of the party (with hilarious results); a costume of an   animal commonly associated with our island (in all probability, a pig) might make an appearance. The japes would be many and varied, but from our point of view, pretty insulting, having fallen back on the keystone cliches of Englishness - that we are starchy, uptight, brutal and we like bacon sandwiches.  Any attempt to represent a nation with its dress is bound to be reductive and therefore dehumanising. It stresses the otherness of foreigners, and rejects the global truth that most people, the world over,   dress more or less the same, apart from the ones who can't afford a telly.  Furthermore, if you look at the individual costumes chosen, you get an even stronger tang of - well, not wishing to bandy the ""racism"" word around too freely, let's call it ""look at the funny natives-ism"". There was a lot of leopard print and snakeskin which (on the basis of only one visit to Africa, granted), I'd say was a closer approximation of a Streatham singles night than an African style statement.  Many of the older gentlemen dressed up in safari suits, which is like going to a Spanish-themed party with a beer, a burger and some vivid red sunburn (sure, there are English people in every country, and they tend to look funny, but you wouldn't say they defined that country's aesthetic). Fergie   wore a long silver wig and whatever the message behind that, I'm sure, even if I knew, I would find it very offensive.  And finally, there is something unsettling about the ongoing (I believe unrequited) love that the posh have for Africa. It does not focus on the realities of its countries in their modern form, but rather is shot through with a plangent nostalgia. And honestly, the subtext of any nostalgia about this continent has to be that it was better when we still owned it.  All told, these are some very murky messages for a 21-year-old to be encouraging. It must be hard to get things right, living perpetually in the public eye. But he could afford to be a lot more dudelike, without getting any less regal."
