1,"Just before the second term launches, consider one thing the first has done. Catch it before it departs into the maw of another mandate where all is forgiven and much forgotten. See what power did in one particular zone, which I'm still prepared to call the moral sensibility of ministers. Not only have their arteries hardened and their consciences grown dull. That's to be expected under the weight of office. More startling is how easily the gates of perception, their sense of what they are doing, have been closed and locked.  When they came to power, one principle they seemed unbreakably attached to was a detestation of racial prejudice. Equality of racial justice and hostility to ethnic discrimination were ideals that united old and new Labour. To men like Tony Blair and Jack Straw they were articles of faith, which lay behind both the swift abolition of the Tories' primary-purpose rule challenging migrant spouses to prove they had any right to join their partners, and the later setting up of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. To Blair and Straw it is unimaginable that they could be party to anything but the most impeccable correctness in all matters that touch on race.   Yet they have been. Two weeks ago, I wrote about the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which outlawed ethnic discrimination by public authorities but made an exception for the immigration service. I unearthed a ministerial order which authorised immigration officers   to treat people of certain nationalities - unspecified, but to be identified at the future decision of ministers and officials - worse than other people. Replying to the critique, Straw pleaded a mere drafting technicality and termed my attack ""bizarre"".   But this order was only a beginning. There has now been a second one, dated April 23, which extends the reach from nationalities to what it describes, in its own headline, as ""discrimination on ground of ethnic or national origin"". This time the ethnics in question are listed: ""a) Kurd, b) Roma, c) Albanian, d) Tamil, e) Pontic Greek, f) Somali, g) Afghan"". All persons of these origins are now to be subject ""to a more rigorous examination than other persons in the same circumstances"". They can be detained, questioned and rejected, as a class, more freely than other people because they are now deemed prima facie more likely to be illegal immigrants or bogus asylum-seekers.   They have something else in common, however. There is no Kurdish passport, there is no Roma passport. Identifying these people can be attempted through little more than their personal appearance, plus some inference from the flight or possibly boat they arrive on. So, not only is the bar on collective discrimination being ditched, but a peculiarly vicious form of sorting is written into statute, whereby immigration officers herd together anyone who looks like a Kurd or a Tamil or a Pontic Greek - regardless of whether these   come, as Tamils do, from Sri Lanka, Canada, India or even the UK - and impose special oppression on them.   Ministers' handling of this law went through two phases. The first, during passage, was to pretend it was benign. The only purpose they cited was to make it easier to discriminate in favour of, say, Kosovan refugees. When pressed by Liberal Democrats such as Lord Lester, that was the scenario they repeatedly mentioned. They were lying. It is quite apparent from the April 23 order that what they wanted all along was the power to authorise state-sponsored mass exclusion of certain ethnic groups, without regard for individual justice, on a scale never before seen in this country.    Phase two came last week. The new law, said Barbara Roche, Straw's minion in charge of immigration, was merely giving formal shape to a practice that had been going on a long time. She was almost flippant in her incredulity that anyone should complain about a long-established pattern of ethnic selection. She talked about the need for ""objective evidence"" against each migrant. But no one has explained how a Roma is meant to overcome the ethnic evidence against him, especially in view of the further sub-clause in the order which states, almost incredibly: ""If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.""   Three conclusions can be drawn from this. First, whether or not ethnic selection went on before, it has now been systematised. If an apparent Kurd, or potential Roma, or notional Pontic Greek has by some oversight not been discriminated against, ministers may want to know the reason why. Immigration controllers are now on formal notice as to which ethnic and national origins are especially unwelcome in Britain. Their conduct will be policed by someone called a ""race monitor"", but only retrospectively and without attention to individual cases. The monitor is plainly a PR stooge in the making.   Second, as the government's contribution to present discontents over asylum, this is political cowardice on a grand scale. No one disputes the need for immigration control. But faced by the mighty force of Ann Widdecombe, Blair and Straw are evidently terrified of electoral punishment if they can't match her rhetoric of national alarm with measures of ethnic hostility. Though all these politicians avow their respect for genuine cases, it's the tritest lip service. Straw collaborates with Widdecombe in a discourse from which only the Lib Dems stand aside, that stigmatises asylum itself as presumptively a bogus concept, eating away at the resources of the fifth largest economy in the world.   Third, something unpleasant has happened to Labour in power. For all sorts of reasons, they need to win the election. I hope they do. They're the only plausible choice on offer and defend several important policies that will probably, given time, make this country a better place. But their immigration regime shows not only that they've become, in a vital area, as bad as the Tories, but that they have lost their intellectual as well as moral faculties. They appear not to know what they're doing. They sincerely believe they do not favour ethnic discrimination. Straw, the posturing anti-racist, thinks any challenge to his law can only be ""bizarre"". He is surrounded by a party that seems to believe the same - barely a squeak came out of it when the law went through.   Such, it seems, is today's corruption of power: not so much a conspiracy of self-interest as the building of a wall of righteous self-belief. A power-driven certainty that, because one is who one is, one can by definition do no wrong. This law of ethnic punishment is a disgrace. Perhaps only a party infused by belief in its own anti-racism would have the nerve to smuggle it past the frontier that separates a decent country from a shameful one.","Between September 11 and July 4, this Independence Day in America, I find I've written 22 Guardian columns devoted one way or another to what grew out of that infamous September moment. Perhaps it was too many. For sure, these pieces contained their share of mis-spoken words and fragile judgments. But here was the big subject. It raised so many issues of global concern, from Euro-American relations, through all the Blair-Bush encounters, into the Middle East process, on to civil liberties. How to forestall and suppress global terrorism is the greatest of all contemporary challenges, subsuming many others about economic and territorial justice on a grand scale. I've tried to address them as a reporter and analyst, as much as an opinionated columnist. Independence Day, however, is the moment to note an unhappy trend. Discourse and relationships have narrowed not broadened in 10 months. There's a hardening of tone between Europe and America. I sense trenches being dug. In particular, it becomes ever more difficult to discuss these colossal problems, rife with potential for prudent scepticism, in words that don't call forth instant labelling as to their categoric loyalty or treason. At the beginning, President Bush stared at the world and said you are either with us or against us. Time hasn't worked any refinement of his message, rather the reverse. We are all anti-Americans now, unless we happen to be pro.  Each side has made its contribution to this starkness. The Europeans began it, with the voices that refused to address what had happened. A seam of vindictiveness exposed itself. Anti-American paranoia enjoyed its finest hour, in some quarters, at the hands of Mohammed Atta, the leader of the plane-bombers.  This lack of empathy, though no longer so pitiless, is still apparent in Europe. Despite the best efforts of some reporters, the European mind - which includes the British mind - recoils from what America has embraced. It does not understand the enormity of what happened not only to New York and Washington but to the psyche of a once invulnerable nation. Most of Europe still tends to take its own experience of terrorism as a reason to disdain Americans' over-reaction to their own taste of it, and I'm speaking of the citizens at least as much as the political leaders. Ultimately, there's a difference of caring and a want of rage.  This has led Europeans into some amnesiac generalisations. They speak about Americans without remembering history, or distinguishing between the people and the Bush regime. They overlook American generosity both as a world power - which nation was it that saved the world from German and Soviet tyranny? - and as a nation of open doors and open hearts. Though the government, even one with a mandate as doubtful as George Bush's, can be said to be acting for the people, it seems important to be as careful in vaporising about Americans as about, say, Jewish or black people. Ethnic monoliths are a curse at every level of humanity.  But some Americans are moving down the same slope. Europeans too are generalised into infamy by the east-coast zeitgeist. Europe has been smeared as generally anti-semitic, on the basis of a microscopic number of voters in two or three countries. Europe is stigmatised as wimpish if not cowardly, because it does not place the same faith as America in the military response to terrorism.  To some extent, each continent is reacting according to the facts of geo-politics. Lesser powers have always sparred with great ones, as jealousies collide. No formerly lesser power knows this better than America. In 1795, John Adams, on the brink of the presidency of a new country still suffering under the transatlantic yoke, wrote to his wife Abigail: ""I wish that misfortune and adversity could soften the temper and humiliate the insolence of John Bull. But he is not yet sufficiently humble. If I mistake not, it is the destiny of America one day to beat down his pride.""  Now that the beating is long done, Europeans have a problem that's acutely visible at this time. They may never be sufficiently humble, but they should at least be clear. Neither the most pro- nor the most anti-American European governments, including this one, are unambiguous about what they want America to do or be. Sometimes, as in the Middle East and Afghanistan, they want intervention of a certain kind. Other times, they rail against American interventionism as if it were an ideological disease. There is justice in the Pentagon's scorn for a continent that wants America to do the heavy lifting against terror, while it dithers on the side.  Americans also need to consider some unlearned lessons. In power politics, the present period cannot be characterised as one of their magnanimous phases. Donald Rumsfeld is as insolent as John Bull used to be. At the grass roots, the soil is even more acidulous than it was a little while ago. I judge from the email responses I've had, often in massive quantities, to some of those 22 columns, almost entirely from the US, where the Guardian website seems to be a must-read. While it's true that more anti-Bush voices are starting to surface, the vocal majority have become more inflexible, more righteous and more harshly scathing of European critics than they were at the turn of the year.  And now we hear their British echoes, from people drawn towards the same stark analysis. Iraq is being prepared for its role as this generation's Vietnam. Long before an invasion happens, adamancy is beginning to prevail. Positions about pre-emption are being pre-emptively demanded: will you be with us or against us, whatever we choose to do? The question is asked at dinner as well as at Camp David. To give the wrong answer is to face certain ignominy from one side or the other, for failing or passing a simplistic loyalty test on an issue no longer to be treated as amenable to honest argument.  It would be another simplistic error to think these attitudes can be reconciled. Good will is not enough to bury such visceral differences as exist on a familiar and lengthening list of issues. The continents are without doubt drifting apart. They have interests in common, but also interests around which America, as now led, has the power and the hardness to insist on non-negotiable policies that we can take or leave. There are few cosy solutions to anything much, which the allies in the old western alliance will any longer unanimously sign up to.  But it only demeans things further to pre-stigmatise all debate with the mark of ""anti-American"". Some Europeans deserve the label, but very few. Most want to share in a dialogue where they are listened to, especially when they disagree. The crisis is far, far too serious for its terms to be entirely coloured by that convenient, thought-killing smear. The US, I think, will do what it wants anyway. But I don't think it's anti-American to say so. The real anti-Americans - anti-worlders, in fact - are those who don't want a serious discussion."

And it is not just him. In the past two weeks the world has been changing astonishingly quickly beneath our feet and commentators are running to keep up. It may turn out to be a temporary phenomenon, just erratic after-shocks before global business returns to normal. But a hurricane wind of change is in the air.<BR><BR> The prospect opens up that a whole logjam of territorial and ideological conflicts have been jolted into unblocking some rivers of progress - if this ends well, if the US stays fully engaged. All of us who stand watching and waiting for war, hearts in mouths, fearing cataclysm but hoping for success, need to be alert and ready to change. This is a time to park ideological shoes outside and be prepared to reassess all kinds of old id&eacute;es fixes, of right and left. (The shoes will still be there if the world disappointingly backslides behind old battlelines.) Start with the Bush phenomenon. This political pygmy fought a poisonous election campaign, a caricature of everything the outside world despises about greedy America. Once in power he was tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to impose NMD as a symbol of a US isolated under its exclusive umbrella - and to hell with the rest of the world. <BR><BR>World trade negotiations were one-sided, not a penny of US debt relief was paid as he pushed through $1.3 trillion tax cuts despite the need for health and schools. Drilling in Alaskan wildlife refuges, the oil man denying global warming and denouncing Kyoto: belching America didn't give a damn, that was the Bush global message. He didn't need to know the names of faraway countries because they didn't count.  But now suddenly they do. One after another the nations of the world joining a grand coalition have shown him how interconnected things are. Foreign peoples are now needed and their needs are interwoven with US interests in security, prosperity, trade and terrorism: no country, even the US, is an island after all. Globalisation works both ways.  Did we misunderestimate the man, to use his own misword? Probably not, but it hardly matters what is or isn't in his head, who pulls his strings, does the diplomacy or writes the speeches. What matters now is what he says and does. On the old Nixon-in-China principle, this man might direct the world towards peace better than some liberal president always fearful of redneck US opinion. So an open mind is required by all after his speech last week and the background briefings since. Astonishing things have been said and done. Short of the fall of the iron curtain, few world leaders have ever about-faced so fast.  One great jolt came when Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defence, mused last week that it would now be necessary for the US to construct an acceptable post-Kyoto strategy: that presumably is a message carried back from Europe, where Green parties share government. All over the world the quid pro quos are coming home to roost: America has had to change. Nothing is set in stone any more, everything is fluid. <BR><BR>Before September 11 there was a European way, largely social democratic, and an American way, largely conservative. British anti-Europeans clung to the US, the left looked to Europe and Tony Blair's bridge across the Atlantic looked like an irritating third way fudge. But those of us who saw the world that way have had to shift: in extremis, the cultural and political dividers between Europe and the US are second-order issues when compared to the Taliban and Bin Laden.  No doubt the day will come again when those issues loom large - but not now. As for the Eurosceptics, they have to swallow their old distaste in admiration for the coherence of Europe of which we are an integral part. In another remarkable global jolt there is Vladimir Putin offering airspace, airports and military aid in a joint Russian/US/EU anti-Taliban enterprise.  One more after-shock is the changed attitude to Israel. Bush said in his early days he would not bother with the peace process, but no more: Israel's best friends now look set to enforce it. Luckily it is a far-right Israeli government that will have to face the global reality of its situation, even if it did greet Jack Straw's mere mention of a Palestinian state as ""obscene"" and ""pornographic"". <BR><BR>But the message of Iran's return to the international fold and all those other Arab states offering positive support has to mean an imposed peace between Israel and Palestine sooner rather than later. It is the absolute sine qua non for calming Islamic fury against the west. Only an Israel residing strictly within its borders can secure long-term security from this new world coalition. <BR><BR>Until now the bloodied Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism could look the soft Americans in the eye and shame them. Now the Americans are bloodied too. As they send their men in to die fighting terrorism they have the moral right to tell the Israelis and the Palestinians that peace is the only game in town, for everyone's safety. Meanwhile Arab autocracies fester dangerously while propped up by the west, but they will not be democratised until the Israel/Palestine tragedy is cauterised.  Will the Afghan war be worth it? The government grumbles about the usual Phil Space articles with whizz-bang boys' comic maps of imaginary fighters zapping phantom Bin Laden hideouts, while the real war plans are secret to virtually all. Laptop brigadiers can only demand that it is quick, proportionate and does not knock down dominos of violence elsewhere. We cannot assess the odds of removing the Taliban, denying terrorists the water they swim in and keeping this coalition together afterwards to ease other long-standing grievances. But official language suggests the US knows that carpet-bombing atrocities would end the fragile coalition.  Pacifists are up in arms, an ever-necessary warning to war leaders not to make matters worse - but alternative plans to bomb the Taliban with food lack a certain conviction. Recent military interventions by the democratic world to impose freedoms have mainly had good outcomes, creating something better for proportionate casualties. Though each war provoked peace protests at the time, most Sierra Leoneans, Kuwaitis, Serbians and Kosovans are better off. So are the peoples of Croatia, East Timor and Argentina. Bosnia and Rwanda were lessons in favour of fighting, where mere peacekeeping permitted shameful massacres.  This time the Taliban are indisputably the vilest regime on earth, as well as lethally dangerous: the only unknown is the outcome. For now, old fixed attitudes towards the US and many other nations need to be suspended, waiting to see if many parts of the world really are undergoing fundamental recalibrations of old positions."

Extremists have to abandon, or at any rate disguise, their passions, and move to positions as close to being all things to all fickle voters as they can invent. That's how Tony Blair made Labour electable. The coalitions of continental Europe are built round the same inescapable proposition. In such politics, nuance replaces conviction, and manoeuvre boldness, as the identifying marks of a winning team. What's going on in America as the 2004 election begins is unnervingly the opposite. It's one of the more extraordinary spectacles a political scientist, or journalist, let alone a professional politician, could encounter. George Bush is running his campaign from the same fringe position as the one he has adopted for his presidency.  This is a hard-right administration offering virtually no concessions to the soothing niceties that might make it more electorally attractive to voters who are not Republicans. Its tax policy is grotesquely loaded against the masses and in favour of the rich. Its bias on the environment unfailingly comes out on the side of the big commercial interests. It is daily tearing up tracts of policy and practice that protected the basic rights of people snared in the justice system. It is the hardest right administration since Herbert Hoover's from a very different era. And, which is the point, delights in being so. There is no apology or cover-up.  But even that isn't the most striking thing about the set-up as it now stands. For this we have to turn to the Democrats. Unlike Bush, many Democrats are sticking to the conventional wisdom. They grope for some kind of centre ground. But so far has the territory shifted, thanks to the Republicans' shameless stakeout on the hard right, that their quest continues to drain their party of most of its meaning and any of its capacity to inspire.  The rules are being observed, but we find that in some circumstances these rules are a fallacy. They draw a party so far into the orbit of its rival as to render itself meaningless as anything except a political machine of variable potency around the country. Yet the dominant mode of most presidential candidates is still to cling to the kind of centrism that defines them at best as Bush-lite, at worst as people who have nothing to say that could send the smallest shiver up the spine of afloating voter.  One should hesitate to second-guess all these massively professional politicians, laden with polls. But their reflex looks to me as unnecessary as it is self-destructive. One way to respond to Bush's rewrite of the rule book - which covers more contentious ground than Ronald Reagan's campaigns ever did, for example - may be to meekly accept the new setting for old maxims. The other is to treat the maxims, in present times, as a snare.   For one thing, many Democrats seem to have forgotten that they did win the election last time. For four years it has been idle to challenge the Florida vote and the bizarre workings of the electoral college, but now is the time to recall that in 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore's progressive version of the future than Bush's more conservative one. Bush was still posing as a bit centrist then, and Gore was scarcely a raving liberal. Gore mostly stuck to the Clinton third way doctrine that had taken the Democrats away from the narrowest version of their past. But there was a left-right choice, and more Americans voted left than right.  In most systems, that would have been another reason for the technical winners to gravitate towards the centre. Since that did not happen, it is instead an excellent reason for the losers to rediscover their raison d'tre. Yet most of them seem mesmerised with terror at the prospect, and full of guff about Democratic ""values"" which they take to excuse them from advancing any awkward Democratic policies.  The Iraq war is to blame for this, but only partly. It is Bush's alibi for everything   else. To the extent that voters dislike his right-wingery on domestic matters, Iraq and terrorism give cover to the Great Leader. We may be sure he will exploit this until the day of the election. It puts Democrats in a bind, though something has changed when dreary Joe Lieberman, an early war supporter, now feels it necessary to bleat defensively that his was a ""principled"" position, and posturing John Kerry - probably the favourite as things stand - calibrates a position edging finely away from believer to mealy-mouthed critic. Another year of Baghdad body bags, with Osama bin Laden still at large, and the politics of the war cannot be so neatly predicted.  For any Democrat to take advantage of Bush's waning popularity and overcome his vast campaign finances, however, he must have something to say. There needs to be some clarity, on all fronts. The other day, the same edition of the New York Times carried stories saying that neither young African-Americans nor the Boston Irish could any longer be counted on as part of the core vote. Is this heresy surprising when nobody knows with any certainty what Democrats stand for? If a party can't fire up its core vote, it will be deader quicker than if it can't draw in people who've never voted for it before. Watching what Bush has done to both the economy and the constitution, it should be easy for a Democrat to come up with soundbites and articles of simple faith to inspire a few more than the millions of Americans who voted for Gore last time.  Wiseacres continue to pretend otherwise. They think Howard Dean, the most lefty of the candidates, and former governor of the state of Vermont, could never get elected. Transfixed by the attractions of triangulated centrism, they're prepared to have its geometry laid out exclusively by their opponents. They come out against a bit of the Bush tax plan but not all of it. They're all but silent, as are much of the media, on what anti-terrorism psychosis is doing to civil liberties.  Yet the Republicans didn't get where they are today by such half-baked timidity. The challenge they make is for the life and death of the soul of the America very many Americans still believe in. What their opponents need is a leader whose voice rings more eloquently than Bush's - surely not the hardest contest to win. That won't happen until they abandon their backing and filling, and their belief that being a Democrat no longer adds up to anything more than a milder version of their enemies.  ""Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice ... Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" Barry Goldwater said that 40 years ago. It was the start of the recovery of the right. The words now belong rather exactly in the other side's mouth. If they came out of Senator Kerry's this autumn, they'd make him sound less like a calculating wimp."
0,"Between September 11 and July 4, this Independence Day in America, I find I've written 22 Guardian columns devoted one way or another to what grew out of that infamous September moment. Perhaps it was too many. For sure, these pieces contained their share of mis-spoken words and fragile judgments. But here was the big subject. It raised so many issues of global concern, from Euro-American relations, through all the Blair-Bush encounters, into the Middle East process, on to civil liberties. How to forestall and suppress global terrorism is the greatest of all contemporary challenges, subsuming many others about economic and territorial justice on a grand scale. I've tried to address them as a reporter and analyst, as much as an opinionated columnist. Independence Day, however, is the moment to note an unhappy trend. Discourse and relationships have narrowed not broadened in 10 months. There's a hardening of tone between Europe and America. I sense trenches being dug. In particular, it becomes ever more difficult to discuss these colossal problems, rife with potential for prudent scepticism, in words that don't call forth instant labelling as to their categoric loyalty or treason. At the beginning, President Bush stared at the world and said you are either with us or against us. Time hasn't worked any refinement of his message, rather the reverse. We are all anti-Americans now, unless we happen to be pro.  Each side has made its contribution to this starkness. The Europeans began it, with the voices that refused to address what had happened. A seam of vindictiveness exposed itself. Anti-American paranoia enjoyed its finest hour, in some quarters, at the hands of Mohammed Atta, the leader of the plane-bombers.  This lack of empathy, though no longer so pitiless, is still apparent in Europe. Despite the best efforts of some reporters, the European mind - which includes the British mind - recoils from what America has embraced. It does not understand the enormity of what happened not only to New York and Washington but to the psyche of a once invulnerable nation. Most of Europe still tends to take its own experience of terrorism as a reason to disdain Americans' over-reaction to their own taste of it, and I'm speaking of the citizens at least as much as the political leaders. Ultimately, there's a difference of caring and a want of rage.  This has led Europeans into some amnesiac generalisations. They speak about Americans without remembering history, or distinguishing between the people and the Bush regime. They overlook American generosity both as a world power - which nation was it that saved the world from German and Soviet tyranny? - and as a nation of open doors and open hearts. Though the government, even one with a mandate as doubtful as George Bush's, can be said to be acting for the people, it seems important to be as careful in vaporising about Americans as about, say, Jewish or black people. Ethnic monoliths are a curse at every level of humanity.  But some Americans are moving down the same slope. Europeans too are generalised into infamy by the east-coast zeitgeist. Europe has been smeared as generally anti-semitic, on the basis of a microscopic number of voters in two or three countries. Europe is stigmatised as wimpish if not cowardly, because it does not place the same faith as America in the military response to terrorism.  To some extent, each continent is reacting according to the facts of geo-politics. Lesser powers have always sparred with great ones, as jealousies collide. No formerly lesser power knows this better than America. In 1795, John Adams, on the brink of the presidency of a new country still suffering under the transatlantic yoke, wrote to his wife Abigail: ""I wish that misfortune and adversity could soften the temper and humiliate the insolence of John Bull. But he is not yet sufficiently humble. If I mistake not, it is the destiny of America one day to beat down his pride.""  Now that the beating is long done, Europeans have a problem that's acutely visible at this time. They may never be sufficiently humble, but they should at least be clear. Neither the most pro- nor the most anti-American European governments, including this one, are unambiguous about what they want America to do or be. Sometimes, as in the Middle East and Afghanistan, they want intervention of a certain kind. Other times, they rail against American interventionism as if it were an ideological disease. There is justice in the Pentagon's scorn for a continent that wants America to do the heavy lifting against terror, while it dithers on the side.  Americans also need to consider some unlearned lessons. In power politics, the present period cannot be characterised as one of their magnanimous phases. Donald Rumsfeld is as insolent as John Bull used to be. At the grass roots, the soil is even more acidulous than it was a little while ago. I judge from the email responses I've had, often in massive quantities, to some of those 22 columns, almost entirely from the US, where the Guardian website seems to be a must-read. While it's true that more anti-Bush voices are starting to surface, the vocal majority have become more inflexible, more righteous and more harshly scathing of European critics than they were at the turn of the year.  And now we hear their British echoes, from people drawn towards the same stark analysis. Iraq is being prepared for its role as this generation's Vietnam. Long before an invasion happens, adamancy is beginning to prevail. Positions about pre-emption are being pre-emptively demanded: will you be with us or against us, whatever we choose to do? The question is asked at dinner as well as at Camp David. To give the wrong answer is to face certain ignominy from one side or the other, for failing or passing a simplistic loyalty test on an issue no longer to be treated as amenable to honest argument.  It would be another simplistic error to think these attitudes can be reconciled. Good will is not enough to bury such visceral differences as exist on a familiar and lengthening list of issues. The continents are without doubt drifting apart. They have interests in common, but also interests around which America, as now led, has the power and the hardness to insist on non-negotiable policies that we can take or leave. There are few cosy solutions to anything much, which the allies in the old western alliance will any longer unanimously sign up to.  But it only demeans things further to pre-stigmatise all debate with the mark of ""anti-American"". Some Europeans deserve the label, but very few. Most want to share in a dialogue where they are listened to, especially when they disagree. The crisis is far, far too serious for its terms to be entirely coloured by that convenient, thought-killing smear. The US, I think, will do what it wants anyway. But I don't think it's anti-American to say so. The real anti-Americans - anti-worlders, in fact - are those who don't want a serious discussion.","Nick Raynsford's alibi is unchallengeable. The minister was not trying to cover up his decision to allow a unique listed building in Oxford to be moved, to make way for a business school funded by the arms broker Wafic Said. He had failed to inform the local MP simply because he was away in Egypt, leading a trade mission.  It's still not clear why the government refused to examine an application to dismantle one of the country's most important industrial monuments, or why the prime minister's office felt compelled to intervene in such a trivial matter as the timing of a planning decision. But the most interesting question has yet to be asked: what was the British planning minister doing on a trade delegation to Egypt? The answer suggests that Mr Raynsford's alibi is rather more heinous than the alleged crime.   Mr Raynsford was leading a delegation of 27 corporations. Among them were some of the most controversial multinationals stationed in this country: Balfour Beatty, Enron, Laing, Mott MacDonald, Thames Water and WS Atkins. The projects they visited included Egypt's most contested development scheme: the $90bn Toshka programme to divert the Nile. Environmentalists warn that it will devastate the river's ecology, financial consultants warn that it will have a similar impact on the country's economy. It's the sort of scheme, in other words, which, were it to have been proposed in Britain, should have been subject to the fiercest scrutiny by planning officials at the Department of the Environment (DoE), overseen by Mr Raynsford.   Interestingly, the major beneficiary of the trade mission appears to have been not a British company, but a Norwegian one. Soon after the tour, Kvaerner revealed that it had landed a 266m contract to build a pumping system at Toshka. Kvaerner's otherwise inexplicable presence on a British trade tour might have had something to do with the fact that it had seconded more of its employees into the DoE than any other company.   So why was Mr Raynsford, rather than a minister from the Department of Trade and Industry, helping these companies to sell their wares in Egypt? Well, Nick Raynsford has a curious double role. He is minister for planning, which means he is the regulator of development in Britain. But he is also minister for construction, which means he is the promoter of development in Britain. He routinely resolves this conflict of interests in favour of the industry he's supposed be regulating.   Mr Raynsford has gone to some lengths to show construction companies whose side he is on. ""I see my job,"" he told Building magazine, as ""creating a climate in   which the industry can do well."" To this end, his division has sought repeatedly to undermine government policy. It has sponsored, for example, a public relations offensive for the quarrying industry called Minerals 98. One of its purposes was to help companies lobby against the tax on roadstone that another division of the environment department had proposed.   At Labour's 1998 local government conference, Mr Raynsford argued against the environment department's plans for a tax on out-of-town parking places and in support of the superstores' objections to them. He has promised the British Council of Shopping Centres that he will seek to speed up major new retail schemes. Last week, he undermined the government's commitments on climate change by watering down the rules on energy efficiency in new homes, arguing that the standards were ""an undue burden on builders"".   But perhaps most alarming is his alleged role in the debate about the Ilisu dam in Turkey: the devastating ethnic cleansing project that will drive 78,000 Kurds out of their cultural heartland. It was Mr Raynsford, according to Whitehall sources, who persuaded Tony Blair to back the project. Why should he have done so? Well, in September 1999 he led a trade mission to Turkey. The consortium he accompanied was seeking to land 4bn-worth of contracts for rebuilding after the earthquake. The consortium was fronted by Balfour Beatty, which also happens to be the firm hoping to build the Ilisu dam. Three months later, the British government announced that it was ""minded to grant"" export credit for the Ilisu scheme. Is it possible that Mr Raynsford was told by the Turkish government that British rebuilding contracts were conditional on support for the dam?   The real scandal surrounding the Oxford business school is that everything Mr Raynsford says about it is probably true. There were no peculiar measures taken to approve the development; there was nothing unusual about the government's decision not to review the case. Decisions to turn a blind eye to the destruction of our heritage and environment are taken on behalf of the construction industry every week, by the man who is supposed to be policing it."
1,"The oldest saw in modern politics is that elections are won only on the centre ground. Extremists have to abandon, or at any rate disguise, their passions, and move to positions as close to being all things to all fickle voters as they can invent. That's how Tony Blair made Labour electable. The coalitions of continental Europe are built round the same inescapable proposition. In such politics, nuance replaces conviction, and manoeuvre boldness, as the identifying marks of a winning team. What's going on in America as the 2004 election begins is unnervingly the opposite. It's one of the more extraordinary spectacles a political scientist, or journalist, let alone a professional politician, could encounter. George Bush is running his campaign from the same fringe position as the one he has adopted for his presidency.  This is a hard-right administration offering virtually no concessions to the soothing niceties that might make it more electorally attractive to voters who are not Republicans. Its tax policy is grotesquely loaded against the masses and in favour of the rich. Its bias on the environment unfailingly comes out on the side of the big commercial interests. It is daily tearing up tracts of policy and practice that protected the basic rights of people snared in the justice system. It is the hardest right administration since Herbert Hoover's from a very different era. And, which is the point, delights in being so. There is no apology or cover-up.  But even that isn't the most striking thing about the set-up as it now stands. For this we have to turn to the Democrats. Unlike Bush, many Democrats are sticking to the conventional wisdom. They grope for some kind of centre ground. But so far has the territory shifted, thanks to the Republicans' shameless stakeout on the hard right, that their quest continues to drain their party of most of its meaning and any of its capacity to inspire.  The rules are being observed, but we find that in some circumstances these rules are a fallacy. They draw a party so far into the orbit of its rival as to render itself meaningless as anything except a political machine of variable potency around the country.

Yet the Republicans didn't get where they are today by such half-baked timidity. The challenge they make is for the life and death of the soul of the America very many Americans still believe in. What their opponents need is a leader whose voice rings more eloquently than Bush's - surely not the hardest contest to win. That won't happen until they abandon their backing and filling, and their belief that being a Democrat no longer adds up to anything more than a milder version of their enemies.  ""Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice ... Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" Barry Goldwater said that 40 years ago. It was the start of the recovery of the right. The words now belong rather exactly in the other side's mouth. If they came out of Senator Kerry's this autumn, they'd make him sound less like a calculating wimp.","For as long as medicine improves, for as long as birthrates fall, there will be problems with the demographic breakdown of developed societies. There are not enough young people to pay for society's old ones as it stands, and it's only going to get worse. Nobody wants to blame greater life expectancy, since it seems churlish to go to all that effort to prolong life, only to then complain about it. Instead, people point to the falling birthrate. In the past this has caused some rancour among childless women, who get blamed for this when in fact women who have children, but opt to stop at two, are by far the more statistically influential group.The Institute for Public Policy Research has characterised the problem as a ""baby gap"" - women want to have children sooner, and more often, than they do. If maternal desire were satisfied, instead of deferred for the sake of careers, an extra 90,000 babies a year would result. However, owing to the maternal pay gap - which means that a woman of 24 on a medium wage would, should she become a mother, earn &pound;564,000 less over the course of her career - women are putting it off. Sometimes this scotches all chance of becoming a mother; more often, we just have to trim our families down a little.So far, so straightforward - what doesn't seem to be straightforward is the connection between whose pay packet is affected, and who makes all the decisions. We are constantly told what women want, vis-a-vis childbirth, what our priorities are, where our thinking is flawed, which mistakes we're making, how our behaviour affects wider society, and which section of us is driving the trend towards geriatric motherhood.It is absolutely illogical to assume that, just because women do the gory bit at the end, we are in charge of the decision to set the whole business in motion. There are, of course, women who go it alone, banditting sperm from unsuspecting males whom they then screw for cash via the Child Support Agency. These women crop up a lot in execrable radio drama, but very rarely in real life. There are women who end up doing it alone, but this doesn't necessarily mean they decided to have children unilaterally.Pending a more in-depth survey, I imagine that people approach having children the same way they would choosing a holiday or a sofa: in some couples the woman will hold sway; in others, the man will. In lovely, healthy couples, all decisions are made jointly and Relate never gets involved. If people are having children later and later, this must be as much a reflection on what men want as it is on what women want. Lots of you could probably offer me case studies about this or that woman who refused tenancy of her womb for her 20s and 30s because she was having too much fun or earning too much; but for every one of them, there'll be another who was badgering for children from the word go, dismissing financial considerations with a nonchalant ""What do babies need? Love and milk!""And yet we never discuss this as a social trend. Generally, we discuss it as a female trend; just as we never discuss childcare in terms of the damage wrought by ""working parents"", only by ""working mothers"". The process of reproducing is always collaborative when it's going well; the fault of women when it isn't. It's so glaring, I'm always amazed that people think they can get away with it, and yet there it is again in reports that ""work pressures force young women to shelve plans for a family"". From the Observer!Having children is almost always a joint decision; a maternal pay cut is almost always assessed in the context of two salaries; men are invariably involved. This isn't something they're suckered into while they're trying to watch the football."
1,"The manufacture of consent is a familiar art of the government propagandist. It's something the media need to avoid playing their unwatchful part in, but it's part of what political persuasion is about. The invention of consent is another matter. It's the modern byproduct of a politics that turns people off. It's therefore likely to be especially alluring to a government that managed to induce only 59% of the voters to turn out at the last election. So we are discovering now. The single most contentious element of the Blair-Blunkett law reform programme is being prepared with the invention of consent. The appointed inventor is Michael Wills MP, junior minister to the lord chancellor. His Saturday letter to the Guardian, replying to a leader, let us into his workshop. Curtailing the right to trial by jury, he wrote, would be subject to the full panoply of consultation. But this was not the point. The change was already a done deal with the people. ""I am surprised you ignore the manifesto on which this government was elected last June,"" he declared, from a substantial height. ""The people considered that manifesto and voted for it."" There was hardly any more to be said.  Seldom has the doctrine of the mandate been more starkly, or more absurdly, put. First, it seems to overlook the problem of scale. When governments got in with 50 or even 40% support, as they did at times in the last century, the mandate might have been   a plausible construct of what could be called the general will. The Blair government got the votes of 23% of the electorate. Was this proof of anything in detail, except a level of reluctant approval exceeding that accorded the other parties?  Second, it must be doubted how many of the few people who, as research always tells us, ""considered that manifesto"" read the section on trial by jury. Their omission would be forgivable. The subject was never mentioned in any speech by anyone in the Labour leadership. It had no priority. It did not feature in the party broadcasts. It could not have been in even the remoter minds of many, if any, of the 10m voters who gave Blair a second term.  That is because of a third factor, namely the absence from this famous, legitimising, solemnly examined manifesto of any explicit promise to abolish the right to jury trial. There were no speeches on the subject partly because the words of the manifesto were crafted to avoid the provocation that might require them. It promised to ""remove the widely abused right of defendants alone to dictate whether or not they should be tried in a crown court"": words that only aficionados of courts were meant to understand as promising the widespread curtailment of jury trial.  What we have, in short, is the opposite of the Wills version of the truth. Instead of majority consent being demonstrably given by the classic democratic method, an attenuated minority were   deprived of such opportunity as they might have had to object to a proposal whose purpose was carefully masked in gobbledegook. Far from the voters having agreed to abolish some jury trials, even the small number who read the manifesto were not confronted with the meaning of what the next Labour government intended to do.   If they had been, no doubt Labour would still have won. But this only adds to the corruption of the mandate theory as Wills and his masters are applying it to trial by jury. What they claim to have got approved, they dishonestly concealed. Now they're relying on it as protection against the thinness of their substantive arguments: their dissembling about the quality of justice that will result: their pretence that the change has nothing to do either with getting more convictions or with saving money: the abject sophistry with which Mr Wills proposes that, because 95% of all crime is tried by magistrates, jumping that up to 98% (why not 100?) should cause us not the slightest apprehension.  The plan grows out of a recommendation by Lord Justice Auld, whose inquiry into the trial process was always   likely to be hot politics in an election year. He adroitly deflected blatant attempts to nobble him, or leak a few cherry-picked ideas. Telephoned one day by a Downing Street official probing to find out where his report was heading, Auld apparently asked Mr Blair's man to put his questions on paper. The official, recoiling in horror, proposed just a casual, always deniable conversation. Fine, said the judge - but wait a moment while I get my shorthand writer.  The probe was quickly abandoned. But abolition of the right to trial by jury turned out to be one of Auld's central recommendations, and one most pleasing to ministers. The right, he proposed, should no longer be available across the range of medium-level cases carrying prison sentences of up to two years, where defendants can now choose whether to go before magistrates or a jury.  Under the rules laid out by Auld, some experts have estimated, this could halve the 50,000 jury trials that take place every year. Internal Home Office papers, picked up in a pub and never formally repudiated, show one official even estimating a two thirds reduction. So this is not a minor re-drawing of the frontiers, as Wills implies. It's an attack on the historic right - one of the most celebrated and worthwhile instruments of British democratic freedom - of perhaps half those accused of serious crimes to be tried by a jury of their peers.  Governments have dreamed of doing this for at least a   decade. The last time it was subjected to rational discussion, when Jack Straw was home secretary, the legislature threw it out. Straw brought it forward twice, in different forms, and each time the House of Lords rejected the new mode of trial he proposed. Each time, the bill fell essentially because of outrage at what could easily lapse into class-based justice.  Shoplifting might attract a small sentence, but for first-time offenders would ruin their reputation, which meant their right to a jury must be inviolate. On the other hand, if that right existed for a white professional, why should it be withdrawn from a black street robber with a record? Such were the dilemmas the Lords thought irresolvable by any bureaucratic system that transferred the decision from the defendant to the magistrates or the district judge.  The arguments have not changed. Auld has not demolished them. It's a matter, in the end, of moral choice. Wills' invention of popular consent is a way of not engaging with the assault the government wants to make on a cornerstone of liberty. It is saying to the House of Lords: do not dare, once again, to defy the will of the people. But the clearer message of this history is to Labour MPs in the House of Commons: you did not get elected to abolish the right to trial by jury, and therefore have no duty to be whipped into abandoning the belief many of you hold, that it would be indefensible.","Four weeks after the election and it almost might not have happened. If elections are meant to bring an infusion of energy to the body politic, this one, seat for seat, was the deadest in living memory. This is not another treatise on the apathy of the voters, but is prompted by something scarier: the desiccated inanition, the droning indecision, of ministers. What a second dose of power seems to have done to them is not renew their purpose but redouble the unbearable caution which, in the first term, persuaded us to suspend every expectation. No sooner have they got back than they've started again on the long haul through the cliches of postponement until the end of the day when the dust never settles. Consider Stephen Byers, secretary of state for transport and a few other things. On Sunday, he had eight minutes on David Frost's sofa to state his case. His field of responsibility is in massive crisis. Transport affects the lives of far more people than either health or education. Rail service is collapsing, roads are slowing down, the London tube is going nowhere. We need to know what Byers will do. Instead we heard a man supremely complacent in the utter emptiness of what he had to say.  Asked about the trains, he admitted things were grim. But he was going to take command. ""It's my responsibility to change that round and really give the industry a sense of focus and do the simple things,"" he grandly said. ""Get trains running on time, safely, and comfortable. That's what the travelling public want."" This was a startling insight. But how would he get the railway people to comply? ""By saying to them they've got to focus on delivering the 10-year plan,"" he puffed. ""And it's got to be done quickly, because travellers were fed up with the industry blaming other people and not taking responsibility.""  This minister knows plenty about not taking responsibility. It is the kernel of his purpose. He was going to get on to Railtrack, he said. Railtrack would be pulling the operating companies together ""to work out a new way forward"". And Byers himself? The imperious command to Railtrack went forth from the Sunday sofa. They must, the minister insisted, ""do that sooner rather than later"". And if this didn't work? ""There'll be more announcements in the next few weeks about the powers that we are using.""  Not even the scandalous million-pound pay-off to Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's disgraced former chairman, could stimulate what might remain of Stephen Byers' capacity to share the indignation of the millions of travellers who now depend on him. When Frost put the question to him, he ran like a neutered rabbit to his burrow. That's not an issue for the secretary of state, he burbled. It was up to the shareholders. But isn't the government, in a way, the biggest shareholder? He was proud enough to say that ""we are making significant investment in Railtrack"", yet didn't seem to see any connection between this fact and the need to account, as a Labour minister, for Corbett's disgustingly generous treatment.  On petrol, we were offered the astounding dictum that ""the British public will not tolerate a price for fuel which is excessive"". On the tube, ""we need to rule out privatisation"" - as if anyone was any longer contemplating it. Throughout the piece, Byers sat in perfect comfort, oblivious to the embarrassment he deserved to feel, no doubt thinking he was doing well, shameless in his refusal to engage with a single policy question, unaware that he epitomised the worst of everything about New Labour: patronising, secretive, indecisive, terrified of breaking with the party line - a line whose commonest ingredient is that nothing should be said.  Watching this performance, I saw more clearly some of the characteristics of this government which, during the second term, seem likely to make us love it less and less.  First, it contains few ministers of any scale. Here was an experienced Cabinet minister who didn't have a single interesting idea about his new job. Like most of them, he is driven by the short-term news agenda, which means essentially remaining in defensive mode at all times. It's all that bothers him. Robin Cook and Clare Short rise above this, and David Blunkett may learn to. But Lord Chancellor Irvine has gone silent for years. The Byers approach, positively yearning for grey anonymity, is the template. The notion of the politician as leader, as challenger of received opinion, as generator of daring debate, is unimaginable in the cohorts of New Labour.  Second, this is a style not merely encouraged but insisted on by the only two ministers who are allowed to matter, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been the feature of their duumvirate.Fighting the battles in the war before last, they insist especially that there must be no perceived disagreements - except the ones they can't conceal between themselves. In most departments, no minister is supposed to have an idea that one of the two duumvirs hasn't had first - or at any rate run through every kind of personal security check.  This breeds a crippling shortage of political imagination. Blairites are a generation of timid politicians. For all I know, Stephen Byers may be a one-man cauldron of creativity. But he never lets it show. The retreat into committees and commissions and proposals ""coming forward"" and plans ""we may look at"" and all the other artefacts of unripe time is a move he makes by reflex instinct.   This is the style that comes from Blair's insistence on bilateral agreement rather than collective discussion, and from Brown's tireless efforts to impose a regime of fear. The hidden presence on Frost's sofa, ensuring that Byers made a fool of himself whenever he was asked to address the voters' concerns about transport, was the chancellor of the exchequer.  Third, though, we do have to return to apathy. The low voter turnout at the election, it is sometimes said, diminished Labour's mandate. I've heard it cited as a reason for the government to resume the ultra-caution with which it conducted itself from 1997 to 2001. This seems precisely the opposite of the truth. If there's a connection, it works the other way. It's the very timidity of ministers, their corporate greyness, the fact that the Cabinet has barely two personalities to rub together, which finds its echo in the electorate. If ministers are run according to a strategy that favours robotic vacuity on the part of almost all of them, why should the voters be expected to take them seriously enough to perform their own part in the democratic process?  The Byers performance was a little Sunday insult. Evidently it's the norm we're meant to accept, from a government that faces no political pressure except that which comes from its own failure to solve problems. It doesn't enlist people's support, but treats them as the enemy, in need of reassurance without promises, and condescension without commitment. I still believe the government can do better than that. But it has to be admitted that the first four weeks have set a style that seems to say the end of the day will never really come."

There is no member of the Cabinet who does not believe in the Bevanite conception of the NHS - a service providing equality of treatment free to every Briton, regardless of age, race, class, gender or geography. Despite New Labour's temporising elsewhere, we should take it at its word on the NHS.  The problem is not the shared goal, it is the means. And here the Government's lack of an overarching philosophy and political coherence is undermining its capacity to achieve the end that it wants. Promises of more spending, shorter waiting-lists and a tougher regime for consultants are all welcome as far as they go, but the problems are much more deep-seated. The NHS is suffering a gathering crisis of legitimacy. Patients and the public at large want a voice and a systematic framework in which they can trust that high quality health care is assured over time.   Yet what is on offer is an increasingly politicised service where effective decision-making is still tightly held at the centre and where some of the policies, notably the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) as it operates in health, are undermining the equality and evenness of provision that the Government seeks.   Three recent events underline the problem; more lie ahead. There is the exercise in public consultation - the so-called health census - to inform the National Plan for Health that has been exposed as little more than a PR stunt. There is the extraordinary fight to prevent the downgrading of Kidderminster General Hospital (part of a larger PFI deal for the nearby Worcester Royal Infirmary), where 19 out of 42 seats on the local district council are held by independent, newly elected councillors who, as members of 'Health Concern', are pledged to fight the plans and are bringing their protest to London next week in a street march. And there is the growing public dismay at medical incompetence, highlighted again by last week's Ritchie Report into Rodney Ledward, the Kent consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician who, over a 16-year career, maimed and harmed any number of women through botched operations.   At first glance, these cases might seem unconnected, yet what binds them together is the great accountability gap that sits in the NHS as a brooding cancer. As long as it remains unaddressed, it will expose the contradictions that beset the Government's NHS policies.   The unprecedented scale of the consultation exercise being mounted before the publication of the National Plan for Health in July is a tacit recognition of the accountability gap. The country's surgeries and supermarkets have been flooded by 12 million leaflets inviting us to identify the three key things we want from the NHS. These have to be completed and sent back by Monday at the latest, a week from start to finish.   However, as Mori's Bob Worcester has said, this is not a serious exercise in finding out what the public wants or the trade-offs it might make between varying claims on NHS resources; that would require intense quantitative and qualitative research. Rather, it is a high-profile exercise in trying to demonstrate that the Government is 'listening', even though it knows the results will be unrepresentative and profoundly compromised by the tight time-scale. But it needs to show that readiness because nothing less will do in today's democratic climate.   Automatic deference to authority is steadily weakening. We live in more democratic times, where everybody believes their voice should be heard. Legitimacy, by government, line manager or NHS consultant has to be earned. The Ledward case, together with the palpable weakness of both NHS managers and the General Medical Council alike in dealing with this rogue consultant, is another nail in that coffin.   Ledward, like Harold Shipman, may be an exception, but the reality is that the system did not catch either early enough and in today's climate such deficiencies are no longer acceptable. The Ritchie Report assembles an impressive list of reforms, bolstering NHS complaints procedures which should be extended to the private sector and calling for beefed-up powers for the General Medical Council. And the Government has responded by saying either reform is in train or it will be.   But as with the census, the larger democratic point is missed. The reason why the health ombudsman is weak, complaints procedures are feeble and regulation is delegated to the medical profession in the shape of the General Medical Council is not some accident - it is because the British doctrine is that accountability lies with the Minister in Parliament and that any other mechanism might challenge that ultimate authority. Thus the ombudsman is kept weak because he or she might challenge the authority of the Minister. There is a linear connection between British constitutional arrangements and Ledward's capacity to practise.   This doctrine is not going to be challenged by New Labour. Instead, the party rel ishes the control it confers; the centre can thus control the terms of the health debate while offering a patina of accountability through consultation exercises like the national census or patients' focus groups. This allows polices like the PFI to be protected, which would not otherwise survive the scrutiny of the democratic rough house.   Yet Kidderminster gives the lie even to this proposition. To scale down Kidderminster General so that it no longer offers in-patient beds, and diverting patients to Worcester, whose Royal Infirmary is being replaced with a PFI hospital that can only afford three-fifths of the existing acute beds, is outrageous. This is not a plan to improve Worcester's health provision that has been driven by Worcester's health needs, settled by open argument. Rather, it is a top-down scheme imposed upon the county by the exigencies of offering private contractors their appropriate financial returns within impossibly tight public-sector expenditure constraints.   Yet the democratic voice cannot be suppressed. Alan Milburn dares not visit Worcester for fear the cameras might catch him with the protesters; next week, the stakes will be higher again as they carry their protest to London. And this is not the Socialist Workers Party; this is middle England in force.   The Government really does want to deliver a better NHS. New money, new schemes and renegotiating the deal with consultants are helpful, but they will not crack the problem. To do that it must close the accountability deficit, with all that implies - delegating power, toughening up regulations, offering elections to health boards and accepting that if the PFI changes the fundamental character of the hospital service, then it must be reformed. It means nothing less than a democratic constitution for the health service, the case the commission I chaired recommended six weeks ago. Our case gets stronger by the day."

Robin Cook and Clare Short rise above this, and David Blunkett may learn to. But Lord Chancellor Irvine has gone silent for years. The Byers approach, positively yearning for grey anonymity, is the template. The notion of the politician as leader, as challenger of received opinion, as generator of daring debate, is unimaginable in the cohorts of New Labour.  Second, this is a style not merely encouraged but insisted on by the only two ministers who are allowed to matter, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been the feature of their duumvirate.Fighting the battles in the war before last, they insist especially that there must be no perceived disagreements - except the ones they can't conceal between themselves. In most departments, no minister is supposed to have an idea that one of the two duumvirs hasn't had first - or at any rate run through every kind of personal security check.  This breeds a crippling shortage of political imagination. Blairites are a generation of timid politicians. For all I know, Stephen Byers may be a one-man cauldron of creativity. But he never lets it show. The retreat into committees and commissions and proposals ""coming forward"" and plans ""we may look at"" and all the other artefacts of unripe time is a move he makes by reflex instinct.   This is the style that comes from Blair's insistence on bilateral agreement rather than collective discussion, and from Brown's tireless efforts to impose a regime of fear. The hidden presence on Frost's sofa, ensuring that Byers made a fool of himself whenever he was asked to address the voters' concerns about transport, was the chancellor of the exchequer.  Third, though, we do have to return to apathy. The low voter turnout at the election, it is sometimes said, diminished Labour's mandate. I've heard it cited as a reason for the government to resume the ultra-caution with which it conducted itself from 1997 to 2001. This seems precisely the opposite of the truth. If there's a connection, it works the other way. It's the very timidity of ministers, their corporate greyness, the fact that the Cabinet has barely two personalities to rub together, which finds its echo in the electorate. If ministers are run according to a strategy that favours robotic vacuity on the part of almost all of them, why should the voters be expected to take them seriously enough to perform their own part in the democratic process?  The Byers performance was a little Sunday insult. Evidently it's the norm we're meant to accept, from a government that faces no political pressure except that which comes from its own failure to solve problems. It doesn't enlist people's support, but treats them as the enemy, in need of reassurance without promises, and condescension without commitment. I still believe the government can do better than that. But it has to be admitted that the first four weeks have set a style that seems to say the end of the day will never really come.","The oldest saw in modern politics is that elections are won only on the centre ground. Extremists have to abandon, or at any rate disguise, their passions, and move to positions as close to being all things to all fickle voters as they can invent. That's how Tony Blair made Labour electable. The coalitions of continental Europe are built round the same inescapable proposition. In such politics, nuance replaces conviction, and manoeuvre boldness, as the identifying marks of a winning team. What's going on in America as the 2004 election begins is unnervingly the opposite. It's one of the more extraordinary spectacles a political scientist, or journalist, let alone a professional politician, could encounter. George Bush is running his campaign from the same fringe position as the one he has adopted for his presidency.  This is a hard-right administration offering virtually no concessions to the soothing niceties that might make it more electorally attractive to voters who are not Republicans. Its tax policy is grotesquely loaded against the masses and in favour of the rich. Its bias on the environment unfailingly comes out on the side of the big commercial interests. It is daily tearing up tracts of policy and practice that protected the basic rights of people snared in the justice system. It is the hardest right administration since Herbert Hoover's from a very different era. And, which is the point, delights in being so. There is no apology or cover-up.  But even that isn't the most striking thing about the set-up as it now stands. For this we have to turn to the Democrats. Unlike Bush, many Democrats are sticking to the conventional wisdom. They grope for some kind of centre ground. But so far has the territory shifted, thanks to the Republicans' shameless stakeout on the hard right, that their quest continues to drain their party of most of its meaning and any of its capacity to inspire.  The rules are being observed, but we find that in some circumstances these rules are a fallacy. They draw a party so far into the orbit of its rival as to render itself meaningless as anything except a political machine of variable potency around the country. Yet the dominant mode of most presidential candidates is still to cling to the kind of centrism that defines them at best as Bush-lite, at worst as people who have nothing to say that could send the smallest shiver up the spine of afloating voter.  One should hesitate to second-guess all these massively professional politicians, laden with polls. But their reflex looks to me as unnecessary as it is self-destructive. One way to respond to Bush's rewrite of the rule book - which covers more contentious ground than Ronald Reagan's campaigns ever did, for example - may be to meekly accept the new setting for old maxims. The other is to treat the maxims, in present times, as a snare.   For one thing, many Democrats seem to have forgotten that they did win the election last time. For four years it has been idle to challenge the Florida vote and the bizarre workings of the electoral college, but now is the time to recall that in 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore's progressive version of the future than Bush's more conservative one. Bush was still posing as a bit centrist then, and Gore was scarcely a raving liberal. Gore mostly stuck to the Clinton third way doctrine that had taken the Democrats away from the narrowest version of their past. But there was a left-right choice, and more Americans voted left than right.  In most systems, that would have been another reason for the technical winners to gravitate towards the centre. Since that did not happen, it is instead an excellent reason for the losers to rediscover their raison d'tre. Yet most of them seem mesmerised with terror at the prospect, and full of guff about Democratic ""values"" which they take to excuse them from advancing any awkward Democratic policies.  The Iraq war is to blame for this, but only partly. It is Bush's alibi for everything   else. To the extent that voters dislike his right-wingery on domestic matters, Iraq and terrorism give cover to the Great Leader. We may be sure he will exploit this until the day of the election. It puts Democrats in a bind, though something has changed when dreary Joe Lieberman, an early war supporter, now feels it necessary to bleat defensively that his was a ""principled"" position, and posturing John Kerry - probably the favourite as things stand - calibrates a position edging finely away from believer to mealy-mouthed critic. Another year of Baghdad body bags, with Osama bin Laden still at large, and the politics of the war cannot be so neatly predicted.  For any Democrat to take advantage of Bush's waning popularity and overcome his vast campaign finances, however, he must have something to say. There needs to be some clarity, on all fronts. The other day, the same edition of the New York Times carried stories saying that neither young African-Americans nor the Boston Irish could any longer be counted on as part of the core vote. Is this heresy surprising when nobody knows with any certainty what Democrats stand for? If a party can't fire up its core vote, it will be deader quicker than if it can't draw in people who've never voted for it before. Watching what Bush has done to both the economy and the constitution, it should be easy for a Democrat to come up with soundbites and articles of simple faith to inspire a few more than the millions of Americans who voted for Gore last time.  Wiseacres continue to pretend otherwise. They think Howard Dean, the most lefty of the candidates, and former governor of the state of Vermont, could never get elected. Transfixed by the attractions of triangulated centrism, they're prepared to have its geometry laid out exclusively by their opponents. They come out against a bit of the Bush tax plan but not all of it. They're all but silent, as are much of the media, on what anti-terrorism psychosis is doing to civil liberties.  Yet the Republicans didn't get where they are today by such half-baked timidity. The challenge they make is for the life and death of the soul of the America very many Americans still believe in. What their opponents need is a leader whose voice rings more eloquently than Bush's - surely not the hardest contest to win. That won't happen until they abandon their backing and filling, and their belief that being a Democrat no longer adds up to anything more than a milder version of their enemies.  ""Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice ... Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" Barry Goldwater said that 40 years ago. It was the start of the recovery of the right. The words now belong rather exactly in the other side's mouth. If they came out of Senator Kerry's this autumn, they'd make him sound less like a calculating wimp."
0,"Four weeks after the election and it almost might not have happened. If elections are meant to bring an infusion of energy to the body politic, this one, seat for seat, was the deadest in living memory. This is not another treatise on the apathy of the voters, but is prompted by something scarier: the desiccated inanition, the droning indecision, of ministers. What a second dose of power seems to have done to them is not renew their purpose but redouble the unbearable caution which, in the first term, persuaded us to suspend every expectation. No sooner have they got back than they've started again on the long haul through the cliches of postponement until the end of the day when the dust never settles. Consider Stephen Byers, secretary of state for transport and a few other things. On Sunday, he had eight minutes on David Frost's sofa to state his case. His field of responsibility is in massive crisis. Transport affects the lives of far more people than either health or education. Rail service is collapsing, roads are slowing down, the London tube is going nowhere. We need to know what Byers will do. Instead we heard a man supremely complacent in the utter emptiness of what he had to say.  Asked about the trains, he admitted things were grim. But he was going to take command. ""It's my responsibility to change that round and really give the industry a sense of focus and do the simple things,"" he grandly said. ""Get trains running on time, safely, and comfortable. That's what the travelling public want."" This was a startling insight. But how would he get the railway people to comply? ""By saying to them they've got to focus on delivering the 10-year plan,"" he puffed. ""And it's got to be done quickly, because travellers were fed up with the industry blaming other people and not taking responsibility.""  This minister knows plenty about not taking responsibility. It is the kernel of his purpose. He was going to get on to Railtrack, he said. Railtrack would be pulling the operating companies together ""to work out a new way forward"". And Byers himself? The imperious command to Railtrack went forth from the Sunday sofa. They must, the minister insisted, ""do that sooner rather than later"". And if this didn't work? ""There'll be more announcements in the next few weeks about the powers that we are using.""  Not even the scandalous million-pound pay-off to Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's disgraced former chairman, could stimulate what might remain of Stephen Byers' capacity to share the indignation of the millions of travellers who now depend on him. When Frost put the question to him, he ran like a neutered rabbit to his burrow. That's not an issue for the secretary of state, he burbled. It was up to the shareholders. But isn't the government, in a way, the biggest shareholder? He was proud enough to say that ""we are making significant investment in Railtrack"", yet didn't seem to see any connection between this fact and the need to account, as a Labour minister, for Corbett's disgustingly generous treatment.  On petrol, we were offered the astounding dictum that ""the British public will not tolerate a price for fuel which is excessive"". On the tube, ""we need to rule out privatisation"" - as if anyone was any longer contemplating it. Throughout the piece, Byers sat in perfect comfort, oblivious to the embarrassment he deserved to feel, no doubt thinking he was doing well, shameless in his refusal to engage with a single policy question, unaware that he epitomised the worst of everything about New Labour: patronising, secretive, indecisive, terrified of breaking with the party line - a line whose commonest ingredient is that nothing should be said.  Watching this performance, I saw more clearly some of the characteristics of this government which, during the second term, seem likely to make us love it less and less.  First, it contains few ministers of any scale. Here was an experienced Cabinet minister who didn't have a single interesting idea about his new job. Like most of them, he is driven by the short-term news agenda, which means essentially remaining in defensive mode at all times. It's all that bothers him.

I still believe the government can do better than that. But it has to be admitted that the first four weeks have set a style that seems to say the end of the day will never really come.","The war seems to be going nowhere, slowly, so Tory MPs have launched a massive rhetorical escalation. The shock-waves could be felt miles away as Sir Peter Tapsell announced that ""this Balkan air war is the most incompetent operation Britain has been involved in since the Crimean war''.

Civilians fled for cover as Alan Clark raged that the United States Air Force had ""an abominable record, hitting Iranian airliners, British forces, bridges, trains, factories and now refugee convoys . . . it is the worst possible implement to use''.

But Mr Clark positively cosied up to the USAF compared to the Downing Street press secretary, Alastair Campbell, ""who has gone to Brussels to put a spin on things. But you cannot spin a war. He would be better advised to stay coaching the prime minister,"" (Mr Clark curled his lip, and when he curls his lip it stays curled, as if he'd inserted Eva Braun heated rollers there) ""whose sole present practice is to wave his hands about and say 'Milosevic' all the time.""

Yet in spite of all this rage, yesterday's debate on Kosovo was grim, unhysterical, and deeply anxious. Often there was an eerie quiet in the chamber , as if no one else was present except the member speaking.

There were no cheers, except for the ritual praise for our armed forces; equally, there was no jeering or scorn. You could sense a certain unease when the isolationists and the pacifists spoke, but this reflected less disagreement with what they said than a mild rancour that anyone could claim with such certainty that they knew what was for the best.

The mood was the opposite of tub-thumping: it was tub-tapping; rabble-soothing, sabre-sheathing, calming and not hortatory.

The foreign secretary began. He was as optimistic as the circumstances currently permit. The campaign had made a ""real impact on President Milosevic's war machine''. (Unlike John Prescott, Mr Cook knows exactly how to pronounce it. He just swallows it whole, like a bad oyster, so it emerges as ""Mlos""'.)

Serbian commanders were having trouble keeping in touch with HQ because of the bombing. Loss of oil reserves meant that `officers have to watch the fuel gauge with increasing worry'', he said, making them sound like Allegro drivers who had forgotten to fill up on Christmas Eve.

Milosevic's tanks are now in hiding from our planes. Serb reservists are refusing the call-up. Around the world, other nations applaud us.

All of this should have been a cause for rejoicing, yet nobody at all rejoiced. Mr Cook stood grasping the dispatch box, one leg and a beard jutting fiercely forward, being heard in something near to silence. This must be the least jingoistic war Britain has ever been engaged in.

MPs are by now way ahead of the government in recognising that a ground war will be essential if Nato is to succeed. Nicholas Soames, Martin Bell  all those who spoke with authority assumed the use of land troops, and the need to prepare public opinion for the inevitable losses.

The most unusual suggestion came from Gwynneth Dunwoody who revealed that as a little girl, she had been taken for tea with Marshal Tito. The thought of Ms Dunwoody as a little girl was bewildering enough. ""Tito told us that when the Germans arrived, the Serbs were largely unarmed, so they put dinner plates on the road. When the very precise Germans got out to look, they were shot, and the Serbs had a tank.""

I'll bet Nato hasn't thought of the dinner plate option. That's why the Greeks are thought of as the weak link in the alliance  they'd want to smash them before they could be used."
1,"I>Poor Mr Baradei,   <BR>His mission is a parody:    <BR>He tells the states (with some aplomb)    <BR>They can and cannot have the bomb</I>Here is the world's most nonsensical job description. Your duty is to work tirelessly to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And to work tirelessly to encourage the proliferation of the means of building them. This is the task of the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei.  He is an able diplomat, and as bold as his predecessor, Hans Blix, in standing up to the global powers. But what he is obliged to take away with one hand, he is obliged to give with the other. His message to the non-nuclear powers is this: you are not allowed to develop the bomb, but we will give you the materials and expertise with which you can build one. It is this mortal contradiction which permitted the government of Iran this weekend to tell him to bog off.  His agency's motto - ""Atoms for Peace"" - wasn't always a lie. In 1953, when Eisenhower founded it with his famous speech to the United Nations, people really seemed to believe that nuclear fission could solve the world's problems. An article in the Herald Tribune, for example, promised that atomic power would create ""an earthly paradise... Our automobiles eventually will have atomic energy units built into them at the factory so that we will never have to refuel them... In a relatively short time we will cease to mine coal.""  Eisenhower seemed convinced that the nuclear sword could be beaten into the nuclear ploughshare. ""It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace."" The nuclear powers, he said, ""should... make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials"" which should then be given to ""the power-starved areas of the world"", ""to provide abundant electrical energy"". This would give them, he argued, the necessary incentive to forswear the use of nuclear weapons.  The IAEA, its statute says, should assist ""the supplying of materials, equipment, or facilities"" to non-nuclear states. It should train nuclear scientists and ""foster the exchange of scientific and technical information"". Its mission, in other words, is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons, while spreading nuclear technology to as many countries as possible. It is also responsible for enforcing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which has the same dual purpose.  There might have been a case, while Eisenhower's dream could still be dreamt. But to persist with this programme long after it became clear that it caused proliferation, not containment,   suggests that the global powers are living in a world of make-believe. The International Atomic Energy Agency has put nuclear technology ""into the hands of those who will know how to strip its civilian casing and adapt it to the arts of war"".  It's not difficult. Every state which has sought to develop a nuclear weapons programme over the past 30 years - Israel, South Africa, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Iraq - has done so by diverting resources from its nuclear power programme. In some cases they built their weapons with the direct assistance of Atoms for Peace.  India developed its bomb with the help of fissionable material and expertise from Canada, the US, Germany, France, Norway and the UK. Pakistan was able to answer the threat with the help of Canada, the US, Germany, France, Belgium, China and the UK. In the name of peace, we equipped these nations for total war.  Now there are about 20 countries which, as a result of foreign help for their civilian nuclear programmes, could, if they choose, become nuclear weapons states within months. When Russia shipped uranium and the technologies required to build a bomb to Iran, it not only had a right to do so: under the non-proliferation treaty, it had a duty to do so.  It's not yet clear whether Iran has stepped over the brink. It is plainly enriching uranium and producing heavy water, which could enable it to build both uranium- and plutonium-based bombs. But both processes are also legitimate means of developing materials for nuclear power generation. To enrich uranium from power-grade to bomb-grade you need only pass it through the centrifuges a few more times. The non-proliferation treaty gives Iran both the right to own the materials and the cover it requires to use them for a weapons programme. If you want to build a bomb, you simply sign the treaties, join the IAEA, then use your entitlements to do what they were designed to prevent.  Iran certainly has plenty of motives for seeking to become a nuclear power. Israel has enough nuclear weapons to wipe it off the map. Sheltered by the US, it has no incentive to dismantle them and sign the non-proliferation treaty. Both the US and the UK have abandoned their own obligations to disarm, and appear to be contemplating a new generation of nuclear weapons. Both governments have also suggested that they would be prepared to use them pre-emptively. Iran is surrounded by American military bases, and is one of the two surviving members of the axis of evil. The other one, North Korea, has been threatening its neighbours with impunity. Why? Because it has the bomb. If Iran is not developing a nuclear weapons programme, it hasn't understood the drift of global politics.   But what can El Baradei do? He can beg Iran to stop developing enriched uranium, but the treaty he is supposed to be enforcing gives him no authority to do so: the government has pointed out that it's legally entitled to pursue all the processes he fears. This is why he's seeking to persuade it to stick to ""voluntary agreements"".  I hope I don't need to explain how dangerous all this is. The official nuclear powers have junked the non-proliferation treaty, while the non-nuclear powers are using it to develop their own programmes. If Hizbullah clobbers Israel, Israel might turn on Iran, and the Middle East could go up in nuclear dust, rapidly followed by everyone else who has decided to join the second nuclear arms race. And the man charged with preventing this from happening is still facilitating it.  The obvious conclusion is that you can't phase out nuclear weapons without phasing out nuclear power. Now that the old treaty has become worse than useless, now that the promise of an earthly paradise of free power and electricity too cheap to meter has been shown to be false, isn't it time for a new nuclear treaty, based not on Eisenhower's chiliastic fantasy but on grim global realities? Isn't it time for Mr Baradei to stop destroying the world in order to save it?  www.monbiot.com","The media couldn't have made a bigger pig's ear of the white phosphorus story. So, before moving on to the new revelations from Falluja, I would like to try to clear up the old ones. There is no hard evidence that white phosphorus was used against civilians. The claim was made in a documentary broadcast on the Italian network RAI, called Falluja: the Hidden Massacre. It claimed that the corpses in the pictures it ran ""showed strange injuries, some burnt to the bone, others with skin hanging from their flesh ... The faces have literally melted away, just like other parts of the body. The clothes are strangely intact."" These assertions were supported by a human-rights advocate who, it said, possessed ""a biology degree"".I, too, possess a biology degree, and I am as well qualified to determine someone's cause of death as I am to perform open-heart surgery. So I asked Chris Milroy, professor of forensic pathology at the University of Sheffield, to watch the film. He reported that ""nothing indicates to me that the bodies have been burnt"". They had turned black and lost their skin ""through decomposition"". We don't yet know how these people died.But there is hard evidence that white phosphorus was deployed as a weapon against combatants in Falluja. As this column revealed last Tuesday, US infantry officers confessed that they had used it to flush out insurgents. A Pentagon spokesman told the BBC that white phosphorus ""was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants"". He claimed ""it is not a chemical weapon. They are not outlawed or illegal."" This denial has been accepted by most of the mainstream media. UN conventions, the Times said, ""ban its use on civilian but not military targets"". But the word ""civilian"" does not occur in the chemical weapons convention. The use of the toxic properties of a chemical as a weapon is illegal, whoever the target is.The Pentagon argues that white phosphorus burns people, rather than poisoning them, and is covered only by the protocol on incendiary weapons, which the US has not signed. But white phosphorus is both incendiary and toxic. The gas it produces attacks the mucous membranes, the eyes and the lungs. As Peter Kaiser of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told the BBC last week: ""If ... the toxic properties of white phosphorus, the caustic properties, are specifically intended to be used as a weapon, that of course is prohibited, because ... any chemicals used against humans or animals that cause harm or death through the toxic properties of the chemical are considered chemical weapons.""The US army knows that its use as a weapon is illegal. In the Battle Book, published by the US Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, my correspondent David Traynier found the following sentence: ""It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets.""Last night the blogger Gabriele Zamparini found a declassified document from the US department of defence, dated April 1991, and titled ""Possible use of phosphorus chemical"". ""During the brutal crackdown that followed the Kurdish uprising,"" it alleges, ""Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam may have possibly used white phosphorus (WP) chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels and the populace in Erbil ... and Dohuk provinces, Iraq. The WP chemical was delivered by artillery rounds and helicopter gunships ... These reports of possible WP chemical weapon attacks spread quickly ... hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled from these two areas."" The Pentagon is in no doubt, in other words, that white phosphorus is an illegal chemical weapon.The insurgents, of course, would be just as dead today if they were killed by other means. So does it matter if chemical weapons were mixed with other munitions? It does. Anyone who has seen those photos of the lines of blind veterans at the remembrance services for the first world war will surely understand the point of international law, and the dangers of undermining it.But we shouldn't forget that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime within a war crime within a war crime. Both the invasion of Iraq and the assault on Falluja were illegal acts of aggression. Before attacking the city, the marines stopped men ""of fighting age"" from leaving. Many women and children stayed: the Guardian's correspondent estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians were left. The marines treated Falluja as if its only inhabitants were fighters. They levelled thousands of buildings, illegally denied access to the Iraqi Red Crescent and, according to the UN's special rapporteur, used ""hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population"".I have been reading accounts of the assault published in the Marine Corps Gazette. The soldiers appear to have believed everything the US government told them. One article claims that ""the absence of civilians meant the marines could employ blast weapons prior to entering houses that had become pillboxes, not homes"". Another said that ""there were less than 500 civilians remaining in the city"". It continued: ""The heroics [of the marines] will be the subject of many articles and books ... The real key to this tactical victory rested in the spirit of the warriors who courageously fought the battle. They deserve all of the credit for liberating Falluja.""But buried in this hogwash is a grave revelation. An assault weapon the marines were using had been armed with warheads containing ""about 35% thermobaric novel explosive (NE) and 65% standard high explosive"". They deployed it ""to cause the roof to collapse and crush the insurgents fortified inside interior rooms"". It was used repeatedly: ""The expenditure of explosives clearing houses was enormous.""The marines can scarcely deny that they know what these weapons do. An article published in the Gazette in 2000 details the effects of their use by the Russians in Grozny. Thermobaric, or ""fuel-air"" weapons, it says, form a cloud of volatile gases or finely powdered explosives. ""This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area. The lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure ... Personnel under the cloud are literally crushed to death. Outside the cloud area, the blast wave travels at some 3,000 metres per second ... As a result, a fuel-air explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without residual radiation ... Those personnel caught directly under the aerosol cloud will die from the flame or overpressure. For those on the periphery of the strike, the injuries can be severe. Burns, broken bones, contusions from flying debris and blindness may result. Further, the crushing injuries from the overpressure can create air embolism within blood vessels, concussions, multiple internal haemorrhages in the liver and spleen, collapsed lungs, rupture of the eardrums and displacement of the eyes from their sockets."" It is hard to see how you could use these weapons in Falluja without killing civilians.This looks to me like a convincing explanation of the damage done to Falluja, a city in which between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians might have been taking refuge. It could also explain the civilian casualties shown in the film. So the question has now widened: is there any crime the coalition forces have not committed in Iraq? www.monbiot.com"

Eisenhower seemed convinced that the nuclear sword could be beaten into the nuclear ploughshare. ""It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace."" The nuclear powers, he said, ""should... make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials"" which should then be given to ""the power-starved areas of the world"", ""to provide abundant electrical energy"". This would give them, he argued, the necessary incentive to forswear the use of nuclear weapons.  The IAEA, its statute says, should assist ""the supplying of materials, equipment, or facilities"" to non-nuclear states. It should train nuclear scientists and ""foster the exchange of scientific and technical information"". Its mission, in other words, is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons, while spreading nuclear technology to as many countries as possible. It is also responsible for enforcing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which has the same dual purpose.  There might have been a case, while Eisenhower's dream could still be dreamt. But to persist with this programme long after it became clear that it caused proliferation, not containment,   suggests that the global powers are living in a world of make-believe. The International Atomic Energy Agency has put nuclear technology ""into the hands of those who will know how to strip its civilian casing and adapt it to the arts of war"".  It's not difficult. Every state which has sought to develop a nuclear weapons programme over the past 30 years - Israel, South Africa, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Iraq - has done so by diverting resources from its nuclear power programme. In some cases they built their weapons with the direct assistance of Atoms for Peace.  India developed its bomb with the help of fissionable material and expertise from Canada, the US, Germany, France, Norway and the UK. Pakistan was able to answer the threat with the help of Canada, the US, Germany, France, Belgium, China and the UK. In the name of peace, we equipped these nations for total war.  Now there are about 20 countries which, as a result of foreign help for their civilian nuclear programmes, could, if they choose, become nuclear weapons states within months. When Russia shipped uranium and the technologies required to build a bomb to Iran, it not only had a right to do so: under the non-proliferation treaty, it had a duty to do so.  It's not yet clear whether Iran has stepped over the brink. It is plainly enriching uranium and producing heavy water, which could enable it to build both uranium- and plutonium-based bombs. But both processes are also legitimate means of developing materials for nuclear power generation. To enrich uranium from power-grade to bomb-grade you need only pass it through the centrifuges a few more times. The non-proliferation treaty gives Iran both the right to own the materials and the cover it requires to use them for a weapons programme. If you want to build a bomb, you simply sign the treaties, join the IAEA, then use your entitlements to do what they were designed to prevent.  Iran certainly has plenty of motives for seeking to become a nuclear power. Israel has enough nuclear weapons to wipe it off the map. Sheltered by the US, it has no incentive to dismantle them and sign the non-proliferation treaty. Both the US and the UK have abandoned their own obligations to disarm, and appear to be contemplating a new generation of nuclear weapons. Both governments have also suggested that they would be prepared to use them pre-emptively. Iran is surrounded by American military bases, and is one of the two surviving members of the axis of evil. The other one, North Korea, has been threatening its neighbours with impunity. Why? Because it has the bomb. If Iran is not developing a nuclear weapons programme, it hasn't understood the drift of global politics.   But what can El Baradei do? He can beg Iran to stop developing enriched uranium, but the treaty he is supposed to be enforcing gives him no authority to do so: the government has pointed out that it's legally entitled to pursue all the processes he fears. This is why he's seeking to persuade it to stick to ""voluntary agreements"".  I hope I don't need to explain how dangerous all this is. The official nuclear powers have junked the non-proliferation treaty, while the non-nuclear powers are using it to develop their own programmes. If Hizbullah clobbers Israel, Israel might turn on Iran, and the Middle East could go up in nuclear dust, rapidly followed by everyone else who has decided to join the second nuclear arms race. And the man charged with preventing this from happening is still facilitating it.  The obvious conclusion is that you can't phase out nuclear weapons without phasing out nuclear power. Now that the old treaty has become worse than useless, now that the promise of an earthly paradise of free power and electricity too cheap to meter has been shown to be false, isn't it time for a new nuclear treaty, based not on Eisenhower's chiliastic fantasy but on grim global realities? Isn't it time for Mr Baradei to stop destroying the world in order to save it?  www.monbiot.com","The NHS is under-resourced. Every user knows it. Its staff know it. The political establishment accepts it. The Prime Minister has admitted as much. Britain has fewer doctors and hospital beds per head than almost any other country in Europe. More needs to be spent, so when Blair committed himself last week to raising health expenditure to the European average by the end of the next parliament there should have been a national sense of relief. Instead it was an occasion for hand-wringing, Prime Ministerial wobble and general disbelief.  It couldn't be done, it was said. There isn't and there won't be enough money. Blair was dodging difficult choices about which taxes to raise. The Conservatives insisted that the only means to this end was to allow the private sector to lead the charge, urging the reintroduction of tax relief for private health insurance. And then Number 10 seemed to get windy, briefing on Monday that it was only an aspiration - and conditional in any case on the economy doing well.   But for once beleaguered liberal Britain should not look a gift horse in the mouth; this is an occasion for a cheer. The Prime Minister, despite his partial retreat, has set an important benchmark for the desirable growth of NHS spending, and by implication other key programmes such as education and transport. He has also put down a marker that the extraordinarily large Treasury surpluses projected in the years ahead will be spent on improving   public services and not given away in tax cuts. And he has put the Tories on the spot; they have to match his commitment or demonstrate that private health insurance can achieve the same result - a demonstration that is beyond them. In the new politics of how to spend the budget surpluses, Blair - panicked perhaps by the hysterical reaction to the comparatively small rise in flu cases and media overkill - has set the political agenda. It is an important moment.   The scale of the implied increase in NHS spending is vast. The 50 billion (in round numbers) spent on the NHS in Britain at the moment is 5.7 per cent of GDP; another 9bn - or 1 per cent of GDP - is spent on health privately. The crude European average is 8 per cent of GDP, but that is simply arrived at by adding up each country's average and dividing it by the total, so that Luxembourg's spending has the same importance as Germany's. If you weight the calculation by size of country, the real average of European health spending, according to the King's Fund, is 8.6 per cent of GDP.   Because the Blair Government does not plan to expand the private health sector, it will have to pay to close the gap of 1.9 per cent of GDP itself - 17bn at today's prices. If it wants to do that over the next six years, health spending will have to rise by just under 8 per cent a year in real terms to 2006; if spending grows at only 5 per cent annum in real terms - the figure the Prime Minister cited - then it will take a full 12 years to reach the true European average. And if the Europeans further increase spending, then it will take longer still. It takes time to redress a generation of neglect.   Can 8 per cent growth in NHS spending until 2006 be achieved without raising taxes? The straight answer is yes, even though it would push Gordon Brown's demanding framework for spending and borrowing to the limit. But spending in every other department   could only grow in line with the growth of GDP, the reason for Cabinet restiveness last week.   If this is a surprise, it is because almost nobody seems to have come to terms with the transformation in public finances under New Labour. The combination of Brown's 'stealth' taxes, equivalent to more than 2 per cent of GDP, sticking to the Conservatives' spending plans for the first two years of this parliament, economic growth of close to 2 per cent instead of recession in 1999, the fall in unemployment and continuing low inflation has been stunning. The current budget surplus last year was 7bn; it will more than double by 2003.   Indeed if the long run economic growth rate is the 2.5 per cent now assumed by the Treasury, then as the TUC calculated in its submission to the Treasury's Spending Review last week, public spending could be raised another 12bn by 2004 and, on my calculations, to the necessary 17bn for the NHS by 2006 - and still leave the 7bn safety margin Brown had last year.   If growth turns out lower, then the NHS budget can be protected by running down the safety margin; and in an economic downturn borrowing is allowed even under Brown's rules. A European class health service is ours for the having - and without raising taxes.   The Conservative proposition that the alternative can be achieved through private insurance is for the birds and, while New Labour retreats and tem porises in so many areas of policy, it is good to see some iron in its soul over private medical insurance. It is expensive, focused on those who are good medical risks, and rarely extends to the over-75s who are most in need. Worse, even if it worked in building up the private sector, it would have the perverse result of driving up the NHS's cost as private contractors bid up wages to attract the limited number of trained staff.   But the proof is in the pudding. Tax relief on medical insurance for the over-60s was introduced in 1990; but by 1997, when Labour abolished it, only 1 per cent more of the over-60s had taken advantage of the tax break. Moreover as the human genome project is completed, we will soon know each individual's DNA structure and predicted health experience; in this emerging world private insurance is madness, because those known to be poor risks will simply not be able to insure themselves at a reasonable premium. Poor Liam Fox, the Shadow Health Secretary, is stuck with a ludicrous, provenly unworkable policy that is out of kilter with the times - the mirror image of Labour's 1983 far-fetched commitment to extend nationalisation to promote economic efficiency.   The only way to fund the NHS is through general taxation or comprehensive social insurance; the hypothecated health tax is another blind alley. If all NHS spending is dependent on a stand-alone or hypothecated tax, then its revenues will go up and down with the economic cycle; if only part is hypothecated, then by the second or third year it becomes impossible to disentangle what is new and what is old money.   On the NHS New Labour is making a stand. What it needs to do next is to drop building privately financed hospitals with fewer beds, genuinely end the internal market and redress the system's disgraceful lack accountability - and we really could start cheering."
1,"The media couldn't have made a bigger pig's ear of the white phosphorus story. So, before moving on to the new revelations from Falluja, I would like to try to clear up the old ones. There is no hard evidence that white phosphorus was used against civilians. The claim was made in a documentary broadcast on the Italian network RAI, called Falluja: the Hidden Massacre. It claimed that the corpses in the pictures it ran ""showed strange injuries, some burnt to the bone, others with skin hanging from their flesh ... The faces have literally melted away, just like other parts of the body. The clothes are strangely intact."" These assertions were supported by a human-rights advocate who, it said, possessed ""a biology degree"".I, too, possess a biology degree, and I am as well qualified to determine someone's cause of death as I am to perform open-heart surgery. So I asked Chris Milroy, professor of forensic pathology at the University of Sheffield, to watch the film. He reported that ""nothing indicates to me that the bodies have been burnt"". They had turned black and lost their skin ""through decomposition"". We don't yet know how these people died.But there is hard evidence that white phosphorus was deployed as a weapon against combatants in Falluja. As this column revealed last Tuesday, US infantry officers confessed that they had used it to flush out insurgents. A Pentagon spokesman told the BBC that white phosphorus ""was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants"". He claimed ""it is not a chemical weapon. They are not outlawed or illegal."" This denial has been accepted by most of the mainstream media. UN conventions, the Times said, ""ban its use on civilian but not military targets"". But the word ""civilian"" does not occur in the chemical weapons convention. The use of the toxic properties of a chemical as a weapon is illegal, whoever the target is.The Pentagon argues that white phosphorus burns people, rather than poisoning them, and is covered only by the protocol on incendiary weapons, which the US has not signed. But white phosphorus is both incendiary and toxic. The gas it produces attacks the mucous membranes, the eyes and the lungs. As Peter Kaiser of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told the BBC last week: ""If ... the toxic properties of white phosphorus, the caustic properties, are specifically intended to be used as a weapon, that of course is prohibited, because ... any chemicals used against humans or animals that cause harm or death through the toxic properties of the chemical are considered chemical weapons.""The US army knows that its use as a weapon is illegal. In the Battle Book, published by the US Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, my correspondent David Traynier found the following sentence: ""It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets.""Last night the blogger Gabriele Zamparini found a declassified document from the US department of defence, dated April 1991, and titled ""Possible use of phosphorus chemical"". ""During the brutal crackdown that followed the Kurdish uprising,"" it alleges, ""Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam may have possibly used white phosphorus (WP) chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels and the populace in Erbil ... and Dohuk provinces, Iraq. The WP chemical was delivered by artillery rounds and helicopter gunships ... These reports of possible WP chemical weapon attacks spread quickly ... hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled from these two areas."" The Pentagon is in no doubt, in other words, that white phosphorus is an illegal chemical weapon.The insurgents, of course, would be just as dead today if they were killed by other means. So does it matter if chemical weapons were mixed with other munitions? It does. Anyone who has seen those photos of the lines of blind veterans at the remembrance services for the first world war will surely understand the point of international law, and the dangers of undermining it.But we shouldn't forget that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime within a war crime within a war crime. Both the invasion of Iraq and the assault on Falluja were illegal acts of aggression. Before attacking the city, the marines stopped men ""of fighting age"" from leaving. Many women and children stayed: the Guardian's correspondent estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians were left. The marines treated Falluja as if its only inhabitants were fighters. They levelled thousands of buildings, illegally denied access to the Iraqi Red Crescent and, according to the UN's special rapporteur, used ""hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population"".I have been reading accounts of the assault published in the Marine Corps Gazette. The soldiers appear to have believed everything the US government told them. One article claims that ""the absence of civilians meant the marines could employ blast weapons prior to entering houses that had become pillboxes, not homes"". Another said that ""there were less than 500 civilians remaining in the city"". It continued: ""The heroics [of the marines] will be the subject of many articles and books ... The real key to this tactical victory rested in the spirit of the warriors who courageously fought the battle. They deserve all of the credit for liberating Falluja.""But buried in this hogwash is a grave revelation. An assault weapon the marines were using had been armed with warheads containing ""about 35% thermobaric novel explosive (NE) and 65% standard high explosive"". They deployed it ""to cause the roof to collapse and crush the insurgents fortified inside interior rooms"". It was used repeatedly: ""The expenditure of explosives clearing houses was enormous.""The marines can scarcely deny that they know what these weapons do. An article published in the Gazette in 2000 details the effects of their use by the Russians in Grozny. Thermobaric, or ""fuel-air"" weapons, it says, form a cloud of volatile gases or finely powdered explosives. ""This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area. The lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure ... Personnel under the cloud are literally crushed to death. Outside the cloud area, the blast wave travels at some 3,000 metres per second ... As a result, a fuel-air explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without residual radiation ... Those personnel caught directly under the aerosol cloud will die from the flame or overpressure. For those on the periphery of the strike, the injuries can be severe. Burns, broken bones, contusions from flying debris and blindness may result. Further, the crushing injuries from the overpressure can create air embolism within blood vessels, concussions, multiple internal haemorrhages in the liver and spleen, collapsed lungs, rupture of the eardrums and displacement of the eyes from their sockets."" It is hard to see how you could use these weapons in Falluja without killing civilians.This looks to me like a convincing explanation of the damage done to Falluja, a city in which between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians might have been taking refuge. It could also explain the civilian casualties shown in the film. So the question has now widened: is there any crime the coalition forces have not committed in Iraq? www.monbiot.com","Nick Raynsford's alibi is unchallengeable. The minister was not trying to cover up his decision to allow a unique listed building in Oxford to be moved, to make way for a business school funded by the arms broker Wafic Said. He had failed to inform the local MP simply because he was away in Egypt, leading a trade mission.  It's still not clear why the government refused to examine an application to dismantle one of the country's most important industrial monuments, or why the prime minister's office felt compelled to intervene in such a trivial matter as the timing of a planning decision. But the most interesting question has yet to be asked: what was the British planning minister doing on a trade delegation to Egypt? The answer suggests that Mr Raynsford's alibi is rather more heinous than the alleged crime.   Mr Raynsford was leading a delegation of 27 corporations. Among them were some of the most controversial multinationals stationed in this country: Balfour Beatty, Enron, Laing, Mott MacDonald, Thames Water and WS Atkins. The projects they visited included Egypt's most contested development scheme: the $90bn Toshka programme to divert the Nile. Environmentalists warn that it will devastate the river's ecology, financial consultants warn that it will have a similar impact on the country's economy. It's the sort of scheme, in other words, which, were it to have been proposed in Britain, should have been subject to the fiercest scrutiny by planning officials at the Department of the Environment (DoE), overseen by Mr Raynsford.   Interestingly, the major beneficiary of the trade mission appears to have been not a British company, but a Norwegian one. Soon after the tour, Kvaerner revealed that it had landed a 266m contract to build a pumping system at Toshka. Kvaerner's otherwise inexplicable presence on a British trade tour might have had something to do with the fact that it had seconded more of its employees into the DoE than any other company.   So why was Mr Raynsford, rather than a minister from the Department of Trade and Industry, helping these companies to sell their wares in Egypt? Well, Nick Raynsford has a curious double role. He is minister for planning, which means he is the regulator of development in Britain. But he is also minister for construction, which means he is the promoter of development in Britain. He routinely resolves this conflict of interests in favour of the industry he's supposed be regulating.   Mr Raynsford has gone to some lengths to show construction companies whose side he is on. ""I see my job,"" he told Building magazine, as ""creating a climate in   which the industry can do well."" To this end, his division has sought repeatedly to undermine government policy. It has sponsored, for example, a public relations offensive for the quarrying industry called Minerals 98. One of its purposes was to help companies lobby against the tax on roadstone that another division of the environment department had proposed.   At Labour's 1998 local government conference, Mr Raynsford argued against the environment department's plans for a tax on out-of-town parking places and in support of the superstores' objections to them. He has promised the British Council of Shopping Centres that he will seek to speed up major new retail schemes. Last week, he undermined the government's commitments on climate change by watering down the rules on energy efficiency in new homes, arguing that the standards were ""an undue burden on builders"".   But perhaps most alarming is his alleged role in the debate about the Ilisu dam in Turkey: the devastating ethnic cleansing project that will drive 78,000 Kurds out of their cultural heartland. It was Mr Raynsford, according to Whitehall sources, who persuaded Tony Blair to back the project. Why should he have done so? Well, in September 1999 he led a trade mission to Turkey. The consortium he accompanied was seeking to land 4bn-worth of contracts for rebuilding after the earthquake. The consortium was fronted by Balfour Beatty, which also happens to be the firm hoping to build the Ilisu dam. Three months later, the British government announced that it was ""minded to grant"" export credit for the Ilisu scheme. Is it possible that Mr Raynsford was told by the Turkish government that British rebuilding contracts were conditional on support for the dam?   The real scandal surrounding the Oxford business school is that everything Mr Raynsford says about it is probably true. There were no peculiar measures taken to approve the development; there was nothing unusual about the government's decision not to review the case. Decisions to turn a blind eye to the destruction of our heritage and environment are taken on behalf of the construction industry every week, by the man who is supposed to be policing it."

So the question has now widened: is there any crime the coalition forces have not committed in Iraq? www.monbiot.com","This week, barring a last-minute climb-down, Iran may get back to building a nuclear bomb. It is a small moment, and a big one. Small because the threat has lingered for years; big because the consequences could convulse the region and the world.If Iran ends its 30-month freeze on uranium tests, the long diplomatic mission by the West will be in ruins. The Foreign Office says all bets will be off; Condoleezza Rice signals that Iran is heading for the UN Security Council, and thus for resolutions and sanctions. Every diplomat and onlooker knows the steps of that quadrille. They danced it for Iraq.As Iran moves towards the ultimate in WMD, George W Bush must be thinking he fought the wrong war. Now, as Israel says Iran's nuclear missile programme 'can be destroyed', the scent of another conflict hangs in the air. Even if President Ahmadinejad steps back from the brink, as he is prone to, there is a wider threat.In the last few days, a 55-page European intelligence assessment has surfaced. This document is an audit of the quest, by rogue states, to buy the kit to make weapons of mass destruction. Syria and North Korea have been stocking up, along with Pakistan, and Iran is allegedly working towards a long-range missile that would reach Italy.In addition, New York Times reporter James Risen claims in a new book that the CIA inadvertently helped Iran build a nuclear bomb by supplying flawed blueprints that the country's scientists may have corrected and used. Obviously, leaked intelligence on WMD comes with some health warnings. How dodgy, exactly, are these dossiers?Maybe the CIA is daft enough to offer up DIY bomb manuals, though this sounds implausible. The Tesco-isation of the nuclear trade raises another caveat. According to the leaked European report, the world is a shopping mall for nukes and the boardrooms and universities of Europe are the bombers' Bond Street.Hardly any of this is top secret or new. Dubious regimes have indeed been stockpiling illicit technology, as if buying beans in Waitrose. A briefing for the Carnegie Endowment think-tank, published in September 2005, two months after the leaked report was written, lists a worldwide history of nuclear deals, including Iran's links with the rogue Pakistani scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan.Nuclear arms never held many surprises. J Robert Oppenheimer, their inventor, called himself 'the destroyer of worlds'; hopes that lavish death could forge a better universe faded faster than the prayers of the pastor who commended to God the Enola Gay, bound for Hiroshima.Sixty years on, the notion of nuclear nemesis has not sunk in. Last year's make-or-break US conference to revive the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty achieved nothing. The pact, ratified in 1970 and signed by 187 countries, was designed to ensure that unarmed states never acquired weapons and that armed nations, in return, would wind down their arsenals.That cornerstone of a peaceful world is crumbling, partly because Bush wants new weapons while demanding that other regimes forswear them, but also because the treaty is fatally flawed. Its aims, to eradicate nuclear weapons while championing the spread of nuclear energy, are irreconcilable. Atoms for Peace, suspect in Eisenhower's day, is an oxymoron in a globalised age.Any rogue state can build up a civil programme, opt out of the treaty with six months' notice and begin making weapons. Iran has always claimed, to universal disbelief, that it is only exercising its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. Pakistan, a non-signatory, was last week reported to be buying up to eight reactors from China, which has long been suspected of helping with its weapons programme.On the campuses of Tehran, even moderately minded students are aggrieved. Who are Bush and Blair to preach while laying in new nukes and welcoming India, with its illicit weapons, into their nuclear club? Israel is stacked with unauthorised nukes, a Nato base sits at Herat and the US Fifth Fleet trawls the Persian Gulf. Why should Iran, so besieged, not have a deterrent?One answer is that Ahmadinejad is a Holocaust-denier who thinks Israel should be 'wiped off the map'. No one could sleep easy with his finger trembling on a nuclear button. But there are more dangerous prospects even that the Iran bomb. Professor Paul Rogers, of Bradford University, thinks it conceivable that Israel could launch a pre-emptive attack against its loose-mouthed neighbour. Ariel Sharon's successor, needing to look tough, may be keener than his predecessor to do so.Israel would have to move fast, though. A few months from now, Iran's powerful Bushehr reactor could be up and running and few attackers would dare unleash a reprise of Chernobyl. Such a threat may seem far-fetched, but the tolerance of George W Bush for a regime he calls 'the world's primary sponsor of terror' is as thin as skin.What a year for Britain to announce a &pound;25 billion replacement for the Trident missile, plus a new generation of nuclear power stations. Tony Blair, intent on both schemes, is braced for protest on weapons but foresees little trouble over energy.Britain is not keen on taking fewer cheap flights and turning out the bathroom light. Nuclear power, touted as a painless option, is costly, risky and produces waste that stays dangerous for 240,000 years. A combination of renewables, energy saving, fossil fuels and carbon storage could provide an alternative. Besides, Britain has a duty to set some example. On nuclear power, the case is far from made.Trident, by contrast, is straightforward. Its replacement should be fought by everyone bothered about world security. More weapons for Britain would be a come-on to every failed state on the planet.In Israel, a leader lies in hospital. In Iraq, 130 people were blown up last Thursday. In North Korea, promises of nuclear disarmament have withered. In Iran, the nuclear scientists resume their work. This may be the most dangerous time since superpowers threatened mutually assured destruction.The world, once an atomic Athenaeum, has become a bomber's eBay, full of murky bidders with pseudonyms and of nukes for auction. The nuclear aristocracy is dead, destruction is democratised and Iran, angry at the West's hypocrisy on the nuclear race, believes that what's good for Totnes is good for Tehran.There is also hope. Iran's theocrats might oust Ahmadinejad. American voters may elect a President who realises, as Blair must too, that the West has to reduce its own arms if it is to persuade others to do likewise. But, for now, Cold War politics looks easy. The abyss was always safer than the quicksand. This time, we cannot simply walk"
1,"I first encountered the phenomenon of Victim's Licence when arguing on a radio show with a British importer of mahogany from the Amazon. I had pointed out that the timber cutters who supplied him were hiring gunmen to shoot indigenous people. ""Well,"" he replied, ""life is cheap in Brazil."" I told him that was a shocking thing to say. ""Don't you lecture me about human rights,"" he snapped. ""My parents were killed in the Holocaust."" And, of course, he put me on the back foot. I mumbled something to the effect that he of all people should know the consequences of waiving the value of human life. But despite his evident hypocrisy, he had acquired moral authority: he had suffered horribly as a result of mass murder; I had not.  It's partly for this reason that we overlook the atrocious crimes committed by the government of Rwanda. Over the past fortnight, as we commemorated the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the Kagame government's foreign policy was all but ignored. The good guys were murdered by the bad guys; the good guys fought back, drove the bad guys out, formed a new government, and peace came to a troubled land. This is the story our fairytale view of history demands: the victims remain victims, the aggressors remain aggressors. They are permitted to change places only when, like the Afghan mojahedin, they find themselves on the wrong side of the geopolitical fence. Until then, the crimes the victims might commit are licensed by compassion and embarrassment.  After the genocide in Rwanda, many of the perpetrators - assisted, disgracefully, by French soldiers - fled to what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Paul Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) chased them over the border, helped Congolese rebels to capture much of the east of the country, and, in 1997, overthrew President Mobutu. Hunting down the genocidaires and deposing the president who sheltered them could both be judged legitimate means of securing peace in Rwanda, but Paul Kagame's army also had other interests.  The misfortune of the Congolese is that they possess tremendous natural wealth. This means, as it has meant in all such places, that they are perpetually exposed to theft, expulsion, slavery and murder. We know all about the crimes of men like King Leopold II of Belgium and President Mobutu. We are less ready to notice the crimes of Paul Kagame.  Six foreign armies have been involved in the theft of the DRC's resources over the past 10 years, but Rwanda's was singled out by the UN's report on the catastrophe there for the ""institutional"" nature of its piracy. The plunder was not caused by an ill-disciplined army running out of control. It was a deliberate policy, commissioned and implemented by the Rwandan government.   By 1999, the ""Congo Desk"" of the Rwandan army was generating 80% of the Rwandan military budget - some $320m. This is the equivalent of 20% of Rwanda's gross national product. The money came principally from two sources: diamonds and coltan. Coltan is the ore from which tantalum, the expensive metal used in mobile phones, is extracted, and almost all of it comes from the DRC.  Sixty to 70% of the coltan exported from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the United Nations reported in 2002, has been mined ""under the direct surveillance"" of the Rwandan army. Most of the rest was produced by subcontractors and companies answerable to the army or to other departments of the Rwandan government. Kagame's people, in other words, had a near-monopoly on global coltan production.  After fighting off the Ugandan army in June 2000, the Rwandan forces managed ""to funnel all the diamonds in Kisangani [in eastern DRC] through the Congo Desk"". Local diamond traders were forced to sell to the contractor nominated by the Rwandan army, and at prices set by the desk. The Rwandans appear to have been stealing about $2m worth of diamonds a month. The army also captured almost all the eastern Congo's public funds, taxing the people and seizing the revenues from water, electricity, roads and airports.  The RPF's original excuse for intervention disappeared pretty rapidly - in fact it soon linked up with the Hutu killers it was supposed to be hunting, and used them to help control the region. Instead, according to the UN: ""With minor exceptions, the objective of [its] military activity is to secure access to mining sites or ensure a supply of captive labour."" On the shores of Lake Tanganyika, according to a report by the Catholic church, Rwandan soldiers tortured, raped and murdered local people.  Ten days ago, Alison des Forges wrote for the Guardian that: ""There is no equivalence, of course, in the kind of crimes charged to the RPF and the crime of genocide."" It's true that the Rwandan army never sought to exterminate the people of the eastern Congo. It is also true that its displacement of local people, who fled as it burned their villages and seized their resources, caused more deaths than the Interahamwe. The militias murdered around 800,000. In the DRC, the UN suggests, more than 3.5 million deaths in excess of previous levels of mortality ""occurred from the beginning of the war up to September 2002. These deaths are a direct result of the occupation by Rwanda and Uganda"".  Kagame formally withdrew his troops from the DRC in 2002, but before doing so he made sure that its wealth continued to flow into Rwanda. He replaced the Congolese bosses of public utilities with his own people,  put the soldiers running the coltan mines in civilian clothes and inserted his troops into local forces. The prosperity which has helped to secure peace in Rwanda derives in large part from the plunder which has helped to sustain war in the DRC.  So last week we saw one of the world's bloodiest war criminals standing in the national stadium in Kigali, holding a red rose and announcing that ""We cannot turn the clock back ... but we have the power to determine the future and to ensure that what happened never happens again."" No one complained. No one pointed out that, thanks to his army, it has already happened, again and again. By preserving the fairytale, we license the victim to keep committing the crime.  It is arguable that nothing so endangers world peace and human rights as official victimhood. Hitler played upon the German people's grievances about the reparations exacted from them after the first world war. The allies overlooked the expulsion of 3 million Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after the second world war. The Israeli government insists that anyone who criticises its human rights record is ""anti-semitic"", a participant, in other words, in the oppression of the Jews. George Bush claims that America has a right to take its war on terror wherever he pleases, as a result of the atrocity it suffered in 2001. We must never forget the appalling crimes from which they draw their licence. But if we really wish to ensure that it ""never happens again"", we must judge people by what they do rather than by who they are.  www.monbiot.com","I>Poor Mr Baradei,   <BR>His mission is a parody:    <BR>He tells the states (with some aplomb)    <BR>They can and cannot have the bomb</I>Here is the world's most nonsensical job description. Your duty is to work tirelessly to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And to work tirelessly to encourage the proliferation of the means of building them. This is the task of the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei.  He is an able diplomat, and as bold as his predecessor, Hans Blix, in standing up to the global powers. But what he is obliged to take away with one hand, he is obliged to give with the other. His message to the non-nuclear powers is this: you are not allowed to develop the bomb, but we will give you the materials and expertise with which you can build one. It is this mortal contradiction which permitted the government of Iran this weekend to tell him to bog off.  His agency's motto - ""Atoms for Peace"" - wasn't always a lie. In 1953, when Eisenhower founded it with his famous speech to the United Nations, people really seemed to believe that nuclear fission could solve the world's problems. An article in the Herald Tribune, for example, promised that atomic power would create ""an earthly paradise... Our automobiles eventually will have atomic energy units built into them at the factory so that we will never have to refuel them... In a relatively short time we will cease to mine coal.""  Eisenhower seemed convinced that the nuclear sword could be beaten into the nuclear ploughshare. ""It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace."" The nuclear powers, he said, ""should... make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials"" which should then be given to ""the power-starved areas of the world"", ""to provide abundant electrical energy"". This would give them, he argued, the necessary incentive to forswear the use of nuclear weapons.  The IAEA, its statute says, should assist ""the supplying of materials, equipment, or facilities"" to non-nuclear states. It should train nuclear scientists and ""foster the exchange of scientific and technical information"". Its mission, in other words, is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons, while spreading nuclear technology to as many countries as possible. It is also responsible for enforcing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which has the same dual purpose.  There might have been a case, while Eisenhower's dream could still be dreamt. But to persist with this programme long after it became clear that it caused proliferation, not containment,   suggests that the global powers are living in a world of make-believe. The International Atomic Energy Agency has put nuclear technology ""into the hands of those who will know how to strip its civilian casing and adapt it to the arts of war"".  It's not difficult. Every state which has sought to develop a nuclear weapons programme over the past 30 years - Israel, South Africa, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Iraq - has done so by diverting resources from its nuclear power programme. In some cases they built their weapons with the direct assistance of Atoms for Peace.  India developed its bomb with the help of fissionable material and expertise from Canada, the US, Germany, France, Norway and the UK. Pakistan was able to answer the threat with the help of Canada, the US, Germany, France, Belgium, China and the UK. In the name of peace, we equipped these nations for total war.  Now there are about 20 countries which, as a result of foreign help for their civilian nuclear programmes, could, if they choose, become nuclear weapons states within months. When Russia shipped uranium and the technologies required to build a bomb to Iran, it not only had a right to do so: under the non-proliferation treaty, it had a duty to do so.  It's not yet clear whether Iran has stepped over the brink. It is plainly enriching uranium and producing heavy water, which could enable it to build both uranium- and plutonium-based bombs. But both processes are also legitimate means of developing materials for nuclear power generation. To enrich uranium from power-grade to bomb-grade you need only pass it through the centrifuges a few more times. The non-proliferation treaty gives Iran both the right to own the materials and the cover it requires to use them for a weapons programme. If you want to build a bomb, you simply sign the treaties, join the IAEA, then use your entitlements to do what they were designed to prevent.  Iran certainly has plenty of motives for seeking to become a nuclear power. Israel has enough nuclear weapons to wipe it off the map. Sheltered by the US, it has no incentive to dismantle them and sign the non-proliferation treaty. Both the US and the UK have abandoned their own obligations to disarm, and appear to be contemplating a new generation of nuclear weapons. Both governments have also suggested that they would be prepared to use them pre-emptively. Iran is surrounded by American military bases, and is one of the two surviving members of the axis of evil. The other one, North Korea, has been threatening its neighbours with impunity. Why? Because it has the bomb. If Iran is not developing a nuclear weapons programme, it hasn't understood the drift of global politics.   But what can El Baradei do? He can beg Iran to stop developing enriched uranium, but the treaty he is supposed to be enforcing gives him no authority to do so: the government has pointed out that it's legally entitled to pursue all the processes he fears. This is why he's seeking to persuade it to stick to ""voluntary agreements"".  I hope I don't need to explain how dangerous all this is. The official nuclear powers have junked the non-proliferation treaty, while the non-nuclear powers are using it to develop their own programmes. If Hizbullah clobbers Israel, Israel might turn on Iran, and the Middle East could go up in nuclear dust, rapidly followed by everyone else who has decided to join the second nuclear arms race. And the man charged with preventing this from happening is still facilitating it.  The obvious conclusion is that you can't phase out nuclear weapons without phasing out nuclear power. Now that the old treaty has become worse than useless, now that the promise of an earthly paradise of free power and electricity too cheap to meter has been shown to be false, isn't it time for a new nuclear treaty, based not on Eisenhower's chiliastic fantasy but on grim global realities? Isn't it time for Mr Baradei to stop destroying the world in order to save it?  www.monbiot.com"

There is no member of the Cabinet who does not believe in the Bevanite conception of the NHS - a service providing equality of treatment free to every Briton, regardless of age, race, class, gender or geography. Despite New Labour's temporising elsewhere, we should take it at its word on the NHS.  The problem is not the shared goal, it is the means. And here the Government's lack of an overarching philosophy and political coherence is undermining its capacity to achieve the end that it wants. Promises of more spending, shorter waiting-lists and a tougher regime for consultants are all welcome as far as they go, but the problems are much more deep-seated. The NHS is suffering a gathering crisis of legitimacy. Patients and the public at large want a voice and a systematic framework in which they can trust that high quality health care is assured over time.   Yet what is on offer is an increasingly politicised service where effective decision-making is still tightly held at the centre and where some of the policies, notably the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) as it operates in health, are undermining the equality and evenness of provision that the Government seeks.   Three recent events underline the problem; more lie ahead. There is the exercise in public consultation - the so-called health census - to inform the National Plan for Health that has been exposed as little more than a PR stunt. There is the extraordinary fight to prevent the downgrading of Kidderminster General Hospital (part of a larger PFI deal for the nearby Worcester Royal Infirmary), where 19 out of 42 seats on the local district council are held by independent, newly elected councillors who, as members of 'Health Concern', are pledged to fight the plans and are bringing their protest to London next week in a street march. And there is the growing public dismay at medical incompetence, highlighted again by last week's Ritchie Report into Rodney Ledward, the Kent consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician who, over a 16-year career, maimed and harmed any number of women through botched operations.   At first glance, these cases might seem unconnected, yet what binds them together is the great accountability gap that sits in the NHS as a brooding cancer. As long as it remains unaddressed, it will expose the contradictions that beset the Government's NHS policies.   The unprecedented scale of the consultation exercise being mounted before the publication of the National Plan for Health in July is a tacit recognition of the accountability gap. The country's surgeries and supermarkets have been flooded by 12 million leaflets inviting us to identify the three key things we want from the NHS. These have to be completed and sent back by Monday at the latest, a week from start to finish.   However, as Mori's Bob Worcester has said, this is not a serious exercise in finding out what the public wants or the trade-offs it might make between varying claims on NHS resources; that would require intense quantitative and qualitative research. Rather, it is a high-profile exercise in trying to demonstrate that the Government is 'listening', even though it knows the results will be unrepresentative and profoundly compromised by the tight time-scale. But it needs to show that readiness because nothing less will do in today's democratic climate.   Automatic deference to authority is steadily weakening. We live in more democratic times, where everybody believes their voice should be heard. Legitimacy, by government, line manager or NHS consultant has to be earned. The Ledward case, together with the palpable weakness of both NHS managers and the General Medical Council alike in dealing with this rogue consultant, is another nail in that coffin.   Ledward, like Harold Shipman, may be an exception, but the reality is that the system did not catch either early enough and in today's climate such deficiencies are no longer acceptable. The Ritchie Report assembles an impressive list of reforms, bolstering NHS complaints procedures which should be extended to the private sector and calling for beefed-up powers for the General Medical Council. And the Government has responded by saying either reform is in train or it will be.   But as with the census, the larger democratic point is missed. The reason why the health ombudsman is weak, complaints procedures are feeble and regulation is delegated to the medical profession in the shape of the General Medical Council is not some accident - it is because the British doctrine is that accountability lies with the Minister in Parliament and that any other mechanism might challenge that ultimate authority. Thus the ombudsman is kept weak because he or she might challenge the authority of the Minister. There is a linear connection between British constitutional arrangements and Ledward's capacity to practise.   This doctrine is not going to be challenged by New Labour. Instead, the party rel ishes the control it confers; the centre can thus control the terms of the health debate while offering a patina of accountability through consultation exercises like the national census or patients' focus groups. This allows polices like the PFI to be protected, which would not otherwise survive the scrutiny of the democratic rough house.   Yet Kidderminster gives the lie even to this proposition. To scale down Kidderminster General so that it no longer offers in-patient beds, and diverting patients to Worcester, whose Royal Infirmary is being replaced with a PFI hospital that can only afford three-fifths of the existing acute beds, is outrageous. This is not a plan to improve Worcester's health provision that has been driven by Worcester's health needs, settled by open argument. Rather, it is a top-down scheme imposed upon the county by the exigencies of offering private contractors their appropriate financial returns within impossibly tight public-sector expenditure constraints.   Yet the democratic voice cannot be suppressed. Alan Milburn dares not visit Worcester for fear the cameras might catch him with the protesters; next week, the stakes will be higher again as they carry their protest to London. And this is not the Socialist Workers Party; this is middle England in force.   The Government really does want to deliver a better NHS. New money, new schemes and renegotiating the deal with consultants are helpful, but they will not crack the problem. To do that it must close the accountability deficit, with all that implies - delegating power, toughening up regulations, offering elections to health boards and accepting that if the PFI changes the fundamental character of the hospital service, then it must be reformed. It means nothing less than a democratic constitution for the health service, the case the commission I chaired recommended six weeks ago. Our case gets stronger by the day."
1,"Nick Raynsford's alibi is unchallengeable. The minister was not trying to cover up his decision to allow a unique listed building in Oxford to be moved, to make way for a business school funded by the arms broker Wafic Said. He had failed to inform the local MP simply because he was away in Egypt, leading a trade mission.  It's still not clear why the government refused to examine an application to dismantle one of the country's most important industrial monuments, or why the prime minister's office felt compelled to intervene in such a trivial matter as the timing of a planning decision. But the most interesting question has yet to be asked: what was the British planning minister doing on a trade delegation to Egypt? The answer suggests that Mr Raynsford's alibi is rather more heinous than the alleged crime.   Mr Raynsford was leading a delegation of 27 corporations. Among them were some of the most controversial multinationals stationed in this country: Balfour Beatty, Enron, Laing, Mott MacDonald, Thames Water and WS Atkins. The projects they visited included Egypt's most contested development scheme: the $90bn Toshka programme to divert the Nile. Environmentalists warn that it will devastate the river's ecology, financial consultants warn that it will have a similar impact on the country's economy. It's the sort of scheme, in other words, which, were it to have been proposed in Britain, should have been subject to the fiercest scrutiny by planning officials at the Department of the Environment (DoE), overseen by Mr Raynsford.   Interestingly, the major beneficiary of the trade mission appears to have been not a British company, but a Norwegian one. Soon after the tour, Kvaerner revealed that it had landed a 266m contract to build a pumping system at Toshka. Kvaerner's otherwise inexplicable presence on a British trade tour might have had something to do with the fact that it had seconded more of its employees into the DoE than any other company.   So why was Mr Raynsford, rather than a minister from the Department of Trade and Industry, helping these companies to sell their wares in Egypt? Well, Nick Raynsford has a curious double role. He is minister for planning, which means he is the regulator of development in Britain. But he is also minister for construction, which means he is the promoter of development in Britain. He routinely resolves this conflict of interests in favour of the industry he's supposed be regulating.   Mr Raynsford has gone to some lengths to show construction companies whose side he is on. ""I see my job,"" he told Building magazine, as ""creating a climate in   which the industry can do well."" To this end, his division has sought repeatedly to undermine government policy. It has sponsored, for example, a public relations offensive for the quarrying industry called Minerals 98. One of its purposes was to help companies lobby against the tax on roadstone that another division of the environment department had proposed.   At Labour's 1998 local government conference, Mr Raynsford argued against the environment department's plans for a tax on out-of-town parking places and in support of the superstores' objections to them. He has promised the British Council of Shopping Centres that he will seek to speed up major new retail schemes. Last week, he undermined the government's commitments on climate change by watering down the rules on energy efficiency in new homes, arguing that the standards were ""an undue burden on builders"".   But perhaps most alarming is his alleged role in the debate about the Ilisu dam in Turkey: the devastating ethnic cleansing project that will drive 78,000 Kurds out of their cultural heartland. It was Mr Raynsford, according to Whitehall sources, who persuaded Tony Blair to back the project. Why should he have done so? Well, in September 1999 he led a trade mission to Turkey. The consortium he accompanied was seeking to land 4bn-worth of contracts for rebuilding after the earthquake. The consortium was fronted by Balfour Beatty, which also happens to be the firm hoping to build the Ilisu dam. Three months later, the British government announced that it was ""minded to grant"" export credit for the Ilisu scheme. Is it possible that Mr Raynsford was told by the Turkish government that British rebuilding contracts were conditional on support for the dam?   The real scandal surrounding the Oxford business school is that everything Mr Raynsford says about it is probably true. There were no peculiar measures taken to approve the development; there was nothing unusual about the government's decision not to review the case. Decisions to turn a blind eye to the destruction of our heritage and environment are taken on behalf of the construction industry every week, by the man who is supposed to be policing it.","The media couldn't have made a bigger pig's ear of the white phosphorus story. So, before moving on to the new revelations from Falluja, I would like to try to clear up the old ones. There is no hard evidence that white phosphorus was used against civilians. The claim was made in a documentary broadcast on the Italian network RAI, called Falluja: the Hidden Massacre. It claimed that the corpses in the pictures it ran ""showed strange injuries, some burnt to the bone, others with skin hanging from their flesh ... The faces have literally melted away, just like other parts of the body. The clothes are strangely intact."" These assertions were supported by a human-rights advocate who, it said, possessed ""a biology degree"".I, too, possess a biology degree, and I am as well qualified to determine someone's cause of death as I am to perform open-heart surgery. So I asked Chris Milroy, professor of forensic pathology at the University of Sheffield, to watch the film. He reported that ""nothing indicates to me that the bodies have been burnt"". They had turned black and lost their skin ""through decomposition"". We don't yet know how these people died.But there is hard evidence that white phosphorus was deployed as a weapon against combatants in Falluja. As this column revealed last Tuesday, US infantry officers confessed that they had used it to flush out insurgents. A Pentagon spokesman told the BBC that white phosphorus ""was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants"". He claimed ""it is not a chemical weapon. They are not outlawed or illegal."" This denial has been accepted by most of the mainstream media. UN conventions, the Times said, ""ban its use on civilian but not military targets"". But the word ""civilian"" does not occur in the chemical weapons convention. The use of the toxic properties of a chemical as a weapon is illegal, whoever the target is.The Pentagon argues that white phosphorus burns people, rather than poisoning them, and is covered only by the protocol on incendiary weapons, which the US has not signed. But white phosphorus is both incendiary and toxic. The gas it produces attacks the mucous membranes, the eyes and the lungs. As Peter Kaiser of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told the BBC last week: ""If ... the toxic properties of white phosphorus, the caustic properties, are specifically intended to be used as a weapon, that of course is prohibited, because ... any chemicals used against humans or animals that cause harm or death through the toxic properties of the chemical are considered chemical weapons.""The US army knows that its use as a weapon is illegal. In the Battle Book, published by the US Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, my correspondent David Traynier found the following sentence: ""It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets.""Last night the blogger Gabriele Zamparini found a declassified document from the US department of defence, dated April 1991, and titled ""Possible use of phosphorus chemical"". ""During the brutal crackdown that followed the Kurdish uprising,"" it alleges, ""Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam may have possibly used white phosphorus (WP) chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels and the populace in Erbil ... and Dohuk provinces, Iraq. The WP chemical was delivered by artillery rounds and helicopter gunships ... These reports of possible WP chemical weapon attacks spread quickly ... hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled from these two areas."" The Pentagon is in no doubt, in other words, that white phosphorus is an illegal chemical weapon.The insurgents, of course, would be just as dead today if they were killed by other means. So does it matter if chemical weapons were mixed with other munitions? It does. Anyone who has seen those photos of the lines of blind veterans at the remembrance services for the first world war will surely understand the point of international law, and the dangers of undermining it.But we shouldn't forget that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime within a war crime within a war crime. Both the invasion of Iraq and the assault on Falluja were illegal acts of aggression. Before attacking the city, the marines stopped men ""of fighting age"" from leaving. Many women and children stayed: the Guardian's correspondent estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians were left. The marines treated Falluja as if its only inhabitants were fighters. They levelled thousands of buildings, illegally denied access to the Iraqi Red Crescent and, according to the UN's special rapporteur, used ""hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population"".I have been reading accounts of the assault published in the Marine Corps Gazette. The soldiers appear to have believed everything the US government told them. One article claims that ""the absence of civilians meant the marines could employ blast weapons prior to entering houses that had become pillboxes, not homes"". Another said that ""there were less than 500 civilians remaining in the city"". It continued: ""The heroics [of the marines] will be the subject of many articles and books ... The real key to this tactical victory rested in the spirit of the warriors who courageously fought the battle. They deserve all of the credit for liberating Falluja.""But buried in this hogwash is a grave revelation. An assault weapon the marines were using had been armed with warheads containing ""about 35% thermobaric novel explosive (NE) and 65% standard high explosive"". They deployed it ""to cause the roof to collapse and crush the insurgents fortified inside interior rooms"". It was used repeatedly: ""The expenditure of explosives clearing houses was enormous.""The marines can scarcely deny that they know what these weapons do. An article published in the Gazette in 2000 details the effects of their use by the Russians in Grozny. Thermobaric, or ""fuel-air"" weapons, it says, form a cloud of volatile gases or finely powdered explosives. ""This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area. The lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure ... Personnel under the cloud are literally crushed to death. Outside the cloud area, the blast wave travels at some 3,000 metres per second ... As a result, a fuel-air explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without residual radiation ... Those personnel caught directly under the aerosol cloud will die from the flame or overpressure. For those on the periphery of the strike, the injuries can be severe. Burns, broken bones, contusions from flying debris and blindness may result. Further, the crushing injuries from the overpressure can create air embolism within blood vessels, concussions, multiple internal haemorrhages in the liver and spleen, collapsed lungs, rupture of the eardrums and displacement of the eyes from their sockets."" It is hard to see how you could use these weapons in Falluja without killing civilians.This looks to me like a convincing explanation of the damage done to Falluja, a city in which between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians might have been taking refuge. It could also explain the civilian casualties shown in the film. So the question has now widened: is there any crime the coalition forces have not committed in Iraq? www.monbiot.com"
0,"Nick Raynsford's alibi is unchallengeable. The minister was not trying to cover up his decision to allow a unique listed building in Oxford to be moved, to make way for a business school funded by the arms broker Wafic Said. He had failed to inform the local MP simply because he was away in Egypt, leading a trade mission.  It's still not clear why the government refused to examine an application to dismantle one of the country's most important industrial monuments, or why the prime minister's office felt compelled to intervene in such a trivial matter as the timing of a planning decision. But the most interesting question has yet to be asked: what was the British planning minister doing on a trade delegation to Egypt? The answer suggests that Mr Raynsford's alibi is rather more heinous than the alleged crime.   Mr Raynsford was leading a delegation of 27 corporations. Among them were some of the most controversial multinationals stationed in this country: Balfour Beatty, Enron, Laing, Mott MacDonald, Thames Water and WS Atkins. The projects they visited included Egypt's most contested development scheme: the $90bn Toshka programme to divert the Nile. Environmentalists warn that it will devastate the river's ecology, financial consultants warn that it will have a similar impact on the country's economy. It's the sort of scheme, in other words, which, were it to have been proposed in Britain, should have been subject to the fiercest scrutiny by planning officials at the Department of the Environment (DoE), overseen by Mr Raynsford.   Interestingly, the major beneficiary of the trade mission appears to have been not a British company, but a Norwegian one. Soon after the tour, Kvaerner revealed that it had landed a 266m contract to build a pumping system at Toshka. Kvaerner's otherwise inexplicable presence on a British trade tour might have had something to do with the fact that it had seconded more of its employees into the DoE than any other company.   So why was Mr Raynsford, rather than a minister from the Department of Trade and Industry, helping these companies to sell their wares in Egypt? Well, Nick Raynsford has a curious double role. He is minister for planning, which means he is the regulator of development in Britain. But he is also minister for construction, which means he is the promoter of development in Britain. He routinely resolves this conflict of interests in favour of the industry he's supposed be regulating.   Mr Raynsford has gone to some lengths to show construction companies whose side he is on. ""I see my job,"" he told Building magazine, as ""creating a climate in   which the industry can do well."" To this end, his division has sought repeatedly to undermine government policy. It has sponsored, for example, a public relations offensive for the quarrying industry called Minerals 98. One of its purposes was to help companies lobby against the tax on roadstone that another division of the environment department had proposed.   At Labour's 1998 local government conference, Mr Raynsford argued against the environment department's plans for a tax on out-of-town parking places and in support of the superstores' objections to them. He has promised the British Council of Shopping Centres that he will seek to speed up major new retail schemes. Last week, he undermined the government's commitments on climate change by watering down the rules on energy efficiency in new homes, arguing that the standards were ""an undue burden on builders"".   But perhaps most alarming is his alleged role in the debate about the Ilisu dam in Turkey: the devastating ethnic cleansing project that will drive 78,000 Kurds out of their cultural heartland. It was Mr Raynsford, according to Whitehall sources, who persuaded Tony Blair to back the project. Why should he have done so? Well, in September 1999 he led a trade mission to Turkey. The consortium he accompanied was seeking to land 4bn-worth of contracts for rebuilding after the earthquake. The consortium was fronted by Balfour Beatty, which also happens to be the firm hoping to build the Ilisu dam. Three months later, the British government announced that it was ""minded to grant"" export credit for the Ilisu scheme. Is it possible that Mr Raynsford was told by the Turkish government that British rebuilding contracts were conditional on support for the dam?   The real scandal surrounding the Oxford business school is that everything Mr Raynsford says about it is probably true. There were no peculiar measures taken to approve the development; there was nothing unusual about the government's decision not to review the case. Decisions to turn a blind eye to the destruction of our heritage and environment are taken on behalf of the construction industry every week, by the man who is supposed to be policing it.","It was Geoffrey Hoon who converted and convinced me. Six weeks ago, in this column, I described myself as an unlikely hawk. And until last Thursday evening, a hawk of sorts I remained. For I accepted the doctrine of the pre-emptive strike - the right of a nation under threat to take early action against a potential aggressor. I still do. But when I heard the secretary of state for defence - appearing on a special edition of Question Time - give the official explanation of why military action against Baghdad might be a regrettable necessity, I became a Gulf war dove. Hoon's indictment of the Baghdad regime was impressive and irrefutable. But most of it had absolutely nothing to do with Saddam Hussein's threat to the west. One item on the charge sheet was a comparison between infant mortality rates in the parts of Iraq under Saddam's personal control and those outside his area of direct influence. As Hoon explained that the further a family lived from the centre of power, the greater its children's life expectancy, I realised what should have been obvious for weeks. We are being encouraged to support the war not because Saddam is a threat, but because he is evil.  Evil he undoubtedly is. But that is not in itself sufficient justification for starting a war that will kill thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of innocent civilians. If it were, God knows how many countries we would be preparing to invade. So next Tuesday, when at last we see the dossier that explains the need for a ""regime change"", we must not be satisfied with a catalogue of wickedness.  Indeed, the more that the president and the prime minister base their argument on the undoubted villainy of Saddam, the more we are entitled to believe that they cannot demonstrate, even to their own satisfaction, that he is likely to attack Israel or the west.  For next week's dossier to be intellectually convincing its claims must be judged against three criteria. Does Saddam possess, or is he likely to acquire, weapons of mass destruction? Does he possess or is he likely to acquire delivery systems, which will allow him to target America and her allies? And assuming he possesses both warheads and missiles, are there any circumstances in which it can be plausibly agreed that he would use them?  No one seriously doubts that Saddam already possesses chemical and biological weapons and that, sooner or later, he will add a primitive nuclear capability to his arsenal. And he is building, perhaps has built, some sort of rocket, as well as a crude version of the flying bomb that was used on London during the last years of the second world war. But the third question still has to be asked. Why should Saddam launch a doomed attack on the most powerful military complex that the world has ever known? I agree he is bad enough to do it. But is he sufficiently insane to set in train a course of action that can only end in his own total destruction?  The official answer to that question is that he happily gassed his own people when they defied his will, so why should we doubt his willingness to gas Americans and Israelis? On such a glorious non sequitur is the case for war constructed. Saddam knew he could get away with mass murder inside his own boundaries. Indeed, the genocide of the marsh Arabs probably made his tyranny more secure. It only needs one gas-filled warhead to land on Long Island for him and his regime to be wiped out. It does not even have to explode.  That fate cannot be avoided - as some of the more fatalistic scenarios suggest - by contracting out the dirty work. It is possible   for freelance fanatics to send envelopes of anthrax through the post and suicide bombers do not need much logistical support. But intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads can only be landed from sophisticated installations by trained technicians. If Saddam was behind it, the world would know and he would pay the price. No doubt he does give comfort and support to al-Qaida terrorists. But if America intends to invade every country that does the same, we are on the eve of another year's war.  To believe that Saddam is likely to attack the west - the only justification for war - is to believe he is a suicidal lunatic. That is an allegation that I have not heard even George Bush make against him. Indeed, the president is now barely even bothering to pretend that it is the fear of attack that prompts American action. Only two of the five requirements that he told the United Nations Saddam must meet had anything to do with the security of the United States. The other three concerned moral conduct not military capability.  For next week's dossier to make me a hawk again it will have to explain why Saddam is bent on self-destruction. Up to now nobody has even tried."
1,"John Major started it with his potty ""family values"" crusade. Thou shalt not fall into bed with the wrong woman and remain a member of my blokeish government. (Shurrup, Edwina!) But prime ministerial pottiness is ever with us. Who, doe-eyed and dripping sincerity, invited our trust - and made himself the ultimate repository of that virtue? Tony Blair. So who now lives or dies on the red line he created?Pause, though, for pottiness is a three-syllable word of some complexity. Major wasn't daft to go back to basics per se; he was crazy to let his moral musings turn into a kind of ministerial code of toe-sucking practice. The truth was then, is now and must indelibly remain that politicians are just ordinary men and women, people like us, people no better than we ought to be. Jawbone them about fornication to your heart's content, but don't make silly, rigid rules that will inevitably - in ordinary, lustful humanity - be broken. That's potty.And trust - after seven years of bitter examination - is just the same, a plastic plant plonked in a flowerpot from some Daily Mail Ideal Home exhibition. The modern Mail, remember, deals in absolutes. Absolute family harmony or perfidy? A Major-type choice. Complete trust in our leaders or another pile of overspun horse manure from Mendacity Inc? It's a phoney construction, but a hugely powerful one: and we've swallowed it hook, line and stinker.Of course politicians, for a while at least, revel in public trust. Leaders great or small always like the adoration of the led. But try injecting another dose of ordinary humanity into that argument.Trust is a relative, nuanced thing. You may or may not trust your neighbour to feed the cat while you're away. It depends on the neighbour. You may or may not tell the local police you're going on holiday. That depends on what happened last time you went to Majorca. Who trusts a boss in a pay negotiation who says he's run out of money on day two? Or a union leader who promises to pull down the pillars then settles behind the arras?Would I trust the present Archbishop of Canterbury to be strong, consistent and stalwart over gay bishops? I'd be a fool if I did. Or the Cantuar just past, peddling an autobiography, to stay mum about Charles and Camilla? Ditto. Or Andy Gilchrist to hang tough when the fires of fury burned too high?

(No: of course you've done that long since, the first of the necessary work skills learned, office politics.) So why on earth should trust in politicians or governments, in prime ministers themselves, come as a job lot of pretty packages? It's an utterly false dichotomy. It carves professional politics away from politics day-to-day and seeks to bathe it in an artificially kindly light.You may trust doctors, but not Harold Shipman. Academic publishers, but not Robert Maxwell. Presidents of the US, but not ... oh, forget it! Some of the time, out in the back garden smoking a surreptitious fag, you may not even trust yourself.The point - the critical point - about any blanket concept of trust is the way it creates a Daily Mail kind of world. They, those bigwigs over there, are the leaders, and we gave them our trust. We, us lot over here, have been lied to and traduced ever since, suckers, victims, neglected pawns. See: the construct assumes that we are fools, self-deluding, malleable idiots incapable of doing what we do naturally in everyday life - thinking, assessing, making our own choices.There's something convenient, in a fast-food sort of way, about that divide, of course. It means we never have to admit that we, personally, might have got an issue wrong. We were ""lied to"" over WMD, and so need never grow introspective about what we'd have done on the information then available. We marched and were spurned.

Too much ado about synthetic sincerity. Trust me, I'm not a politician.","The chances of Gordon Brown ever becoming prime minister have diminished, are diminishing - and will continue to diminish inexorably. A sad, sad song. It's always tough when a hugely talented professional sees his heart's desire slip away. But it is also - no ducking, weaving or glossing - Gordon's own fault: bad politics as well as bad vibrations. Take a few findings from the latest Telegraph/YouGov poll. Do you approve of the government's record to date? No, say 68%. What about issues like Europe and taxation? The Tories are in the lead. And economic competence, the rock of reputations prudently built? Just 32% have kept faith with Brown. And 31% (since you ask) would prefer to see Michael Howard on the Treasury bridge. There's something of the night for all concerned here.  Now polls, of course, can be shrugged away. The chancel-lor's spinners say he'll shrug for Britain today when he tells the Social Market Forum that his ""prudent and cautious"" spending plans are on course, needing no new taxes; that the dear old ""fundamentals are sound""; that while our share prices are only 48% down, Germany's have tumbled a whopping 67%. But this, alas, is politics, not comparative economics. This is show-business. Listen, therefore, to the dismal tinkle of luck and applause running out.  He said there'd be no more boom and bust. That is not how it feels. He took an early pop at the pension funds. Now they're becoming a national crisis, staggering from pillar to post, demolishing ordinary dreams as they go. Just as the taxation tide turns, so last year's national insurance rises snap into place. Just as the cash for public services comes on stream, so the firemen stoke a different boiler. Just as congestion charges arrive, so the Central line goes awol. And then there is university funding.  Every problem that seemed so breezy when there was growth and confidence, in short, now comes glooming round to Gordon's door. Things could be more awful, naturally. That's always true. Yet lustre, once lost, is powerful hard to get shining again.  In a normal Westminster world, you'd know what would happen next. A threat to the chancellor would be a threat to the prime minister and continuing governance. It would thus be loyally batted away unless (like Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson) ritual sacrifices were more the order of the day. A chancellor is there to be defended until it's time, in extremis, to ditch him. But Mr Brown and Mr Blair don't live in a ""normal"" world.  They are both big beasts. Almost a decade ago, they sat over lunch in Islington and made the Granita accord. I won't stand against you for Labour leader (and thus prospective PM) if you quit half-way through your second term and let me have a go. Was it ever quite as neat as that? The old Granita restaurant was a famously noisy, clattery place. Maybe Tony dropped his bread roll at the wrong moment? Maybe Gordon found a fly in his soup? Still ... the legend and the black looks live on.  What we've had for almost six years now isn't the traditional line of command, prime minister down to chancellor, but more a division of the Whitehall realm into two rival kingdoms. The leaders have their own camps and followers. They jockey, needle and probe. They are allies in public and snarlers or sniffers behind the arras. Like North and South Korea, they always need watching. And it's Granita time, time to move over. High noon.  But is Mr Blair going to pack his bags and, like Peter Foster, depart for distant parts? Of course not. That was always an illusion. A disastrous war in Iraq might carry him off - but, in harsh practicality if not morality, it's far more likely that Saddam will crumple and a string of Iraqi scientists thereafter bear witness to the horrors averted. There's no alternative to a continuing Tony. There are, however, plenty of reasons why a continuing Gordon may not be so fireproof. Who wants a magician who's lost his wand? Who wants a baleful, brooding problem when fresh starts are easier?  It is because the realm was divided, because the pieces were scrapped over and parcelled out, that Gordon Brown is suddenly so vulnerable. Traditionally, when a prime minister has a night of the long knives with his neighbour, it is the PM's own status and policies that also appear in the frame. Sacking has its costs. But here the equation is different. Because Brown manifestly runs his own five tests, his own prescriptions for the markets, his own private funding initiatives and target-setting squads, because they are his and not Blair's, so the policies and the man can be simultaneously removed without that damage: a liberation rather than an assassination.  Would there be crisis and flak when the moment came? Inescapably. But it would also set the prime minister free, on course to be his own man with his own chancellor for a third term. It would allow New Labour a new beginning. And to see the logic, you need only consider the alternative: no change, no joy, animosity as usual. Who can possibly settle for another six years of this? Who would want to?  There's the fault with Mr Brown. He shouldn't have believed his own publicity. He should have shifted himself, in triumph, to foreign secretary or deputy PM a year ago. He should have remained forever Mr Boom not Mr Bust. He should have known that, like Jim Callaghan, his time would come if he was loyal and efficient and on the team, not a king over the water. He should, simply, have been smarter."

Too much ado about synthetic sincerity. Trust me, I'm not a politician.","The search for silver linings in the murky cloud of yesterday's Israeli election requires a great effort of the will. There is not much to go on. You could draw comfort from the fact that Likud's Bibi Netanyahu, who thought he was such a dead cert to win a matter of weeks ago, was rejected, albeit narrowly, in favour of the woman he so consistently patronised, Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  Or you might take solace in the notion that the near tie between Bibi and Tzipi would most easily be resolved by the pair rotating the premiership between them, each taking a two-year turn, following the precedent set by Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir after they fought each other to a dead heat in 1984. The virtue of such an arrangement could be the exclusion of the ultra-nationalist hardman Avigdor Lieberman, whose Israel Beytenu  Israel our Home  party surged to third place on Tuesday. Or you might assume that the likeliest coalition will be unambiguously of the right, given that  even though Likud itself fell short  the parties of the self-styled ""national camp"" won a convincing victory over the centre-left bloc. Bibi's motivation will be to expose Kadima to the chill of opposition for the first time in its short life, where, Bibi hopes, it will wither and die. The result will be the most rightwing government in Israel's history. Good, one longtime peace campaigner told me yesterday. ""Let the right have power and live with the consequences."" They will soon be on a collision course with Barack Obama's Washington. Under US pressure, they will unravel, the right's limitations will have been exposed and the pendulum will swing back leftwards.  Even if that is too hopeful, some on the Israeli left see a value in the country having a full-bloodedly rightist government. ""Maybe we're like the alcoholic who needs to touch bottom before we can start the climb back up,"" was how one put it. Perhaps there has to be a crisis before there can be a recovery.  If these sound like heroic attempts at self-consolation, that is because they are. The truth is, the clouds are much clearer to see. The hawkish camp thumped the centre left on Tuesday, and that's even when you generously count Kadima and Labour  co-authors of operation Cast Lead  as the centre left. But this is about more than a victory for the right. Something else happened and its face belongs to Avigdor Lieberman, the kingmaker whose 15 seats are essential if either Bibi or Livni are to govern without each other.   He does not fit straightforwardly on the Israeli right wing. For one thing, he is avowedly secular. Indeed, much of his appeal was to anti-religious voters who liked his demand for civil unions, thereby breaking the orthodox rabbinate's current monopoly on state-sanctioned marriage. Talk of liberalising the sale of pork products proved too much for at least one religious party, whose spiritual leader warned that a vote for Lieberman was a vote for Satan. The result is that Bibi may find assembling a coalition that includes both the religious parties and Lieberman impossible.  Even more striking is the kingmaker's stance on the defining issue of Israeli politics: territorial compromise. The hard right have always opposed the very idea, clinging to the notion of Greater Israel. But Lieberman  who lives in a West Bank settlement  has said he would be prepared to give up even his own home. Unlike some of his fellow settlers, he does not regard the land as sacred soil that can never be conceded.  Make no mistake, this is not because Lieberman is some kind of crypto- peacenik. The opposite is true: I saw him give a victory speech on Tuesday in which he declared his refusal to join any government that would allow Hamas to remain in power: ""Our first goal is clear, to destroy Hamas, to take it down.""  What separates Lieberman from the traditional Revisionist Zionists that formed Likud is that his goal is not holding on to the maximum amount of land but governing over the minimum number of Arabs. To put it concisely, he would prefer a smaller, ethnically pure Israel to a larger, binational one. To that end, he would give up heavily-populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank and  much more controversially  seeks to redraw the border so that Arab areas of pre-1967 Israel become part of a Palestinian state. In other words, those who are now Palestinian citizens of Israel will find themselves living in their same homes  but under the jurisdiction of another country. Whether their consent will be sought for this move is left vague.  But it's not this idea which has made Lieberman such a toxic force. For that you have to look to the slogan that drove his campaign: ""No loyalty, no citizenship."" He would insist that every Israeli swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: anyone who refuses will lose his citizenship.  Israel Beytenu denies this is racist, insisting that every Israeli will have to swear the oath, Jewish or Arab. It is true that plenty of ultra-orthodox Jews who don't accept the authority of a godless secular state may also refuse. But the target is clearly Israel's 1.45 million Arabs. If they will not swear their allegiance, explains Lieberman deputy Uzi Landau, ""They will have residency rights but no right to vote or be in the Knesset.""  It is a truly shocking idea. I asked several Israel Beytenu luminaries if they could name a single democracy anywhere that had removed citizenship from those who already had it. I asked what they would make of demanding that, say, British Jews, swear an oath of loyalty to Britain as a Christian country on pain of losing their right to vote. I got no good answers.  There was a time when such a poisonous idea would have been confined to the lunatic extremes of the racist Kach party, led by Meir Kahane (of whose youth wing Lieberman was once a member). Twenty five years ago Kahane was banned from the Knesset. Now his heir is courted by the two main parties, desperate for his support. Kadima is untroubled by the loyalty oath scheme; Bibi says he agrees with it.  Who is to blame for this? Israel Beytenu puts the blame on the Israeli Arab leadership for flaunting their ""disloyalty"", especially during January's Gaza offensive when several prominent Israeli Arabs proclaimed their solidarity with Hamas. They say no democratic society could tolerate such a fifth column, cheering on a mortal enemy.  The Israeli left bear some indirect responsibility here too, at least for the idea of reassigning Palestinian villages inside Israel to Palestine. For years, the left has couched its opposition to the occupation in demographic terms: ruling over millions of Palestinians would eventually imperil Israel's status as a Jewish state. Lieberman is simply extending that logic beyond the 1967 borders. In this sense Lieberman is the bastard child of the Israeli peace movement.  Above all, it is Israeli society that has to take a hard look at itself. For so long, it has lived inside a bubble in which it can only see its side of the story: they hit us, so we hit back; we are under siege from hostile forces, we are the victim. In this mental landscape, even a Moldovan-born immigrant stripping people born in their own land of their citizenship can come to seem acceptable. What's needed is not just a change in the electoral system that would allow ""strong government"" of the kind Lieberman yearns to implement. What's needed is for Israelis to step outside the bubble, to begin to see the causes of their current predicament, instead of dealing again and again, ever more ineffectively, with the symptoms. Tuesday's election prompts no confidence that that is about to happen."
1,"The Sri Lankan government may finally have beaten the Tamil Tigers, but now stands in imminent danger of defeat in the crucial battle for public opinion. Colombo needs massive international aid. It also needs to bind up the wounds of a fatally divided nation. Yet it is doing neither of those things, opting instead for the secrecy and evasion that dogged its conduct of this civil war. Does it matter, now the conflict is over, that international reporters are still cooped up in Colombo hotels, unable to visit the scene of the Tigers' last stand hundreds of miles away, or to gauge the suffering of the 200,000 or so Tamil civilians trapped by the fighting? Of course it does. This is a public relations disaster, with two fingers raised to charities, broadcasters and diplomats alike. Keeping independent journalists and UN observers far away from the action might - just - be defended while a bloody war reached a bloody conclusion. But now there are no excuses left. The world wants to see for itself. Sri Lanka, under the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, has a lousy press freedom record which would put any proper democracy to shame. Sixteen reporters and editors have died there in the past five years. Lasantha Wikremetunge, the editor of the Sunday Leader, was one such victim. He had a national and international reputation and his murder reverberated far beyond Sri Lanka. Tamil writers, like JS Tissainayagam, of OutreachSL, have been arbitrarily locked up for questioning the conduct of the war in moderate, concerned terms. Simply put, this isn't good enough for a government claiming freedom's ways or freedom's aid. It sets Rajapaksa apart from his Indian, Bangladeshi or even Pakistani neighbours, and it mocks the rule of law. Press repression and suppression has to stop. Sri Lanka once had a vibrant, often courageous press that helped define its democracy. If Rajapaksa - a lawyer himself, ironically - spurns that inheritance, then more than his country's reputation is at stake: for there is no reconciliation under cover of darkness, either.","The chances of Gordon Brown ever becoming prime minister have diminished, are diminishing - and will continue to diminish inexorably. A sad, sad song. It's always tough when a hugely talented professional sees his heart's desire slip away. But it is also - no ducking, weaving or glossing - Gordon's own fault: bad politics as well as bad vibrations. Take a few findings from the latest Telegraph/YouGov poll. Do you approve of the government's record to date? No, say 68%. What about issues like Europe and taxation? The Tories are in the lead. And economic competence, the rock of reputations prudently built? Just 32% have kept faith with Brown. And 31% (since you ask) would prefer to see Michael Howard on the Treasury bridge. There's something of the night for all concerned here.  Now polls, of course, can be shrugged away. The chancel-lor's spinners say he'll shrug for Britain today when he tells the Social Market Forum that his ""prudent and cautious"" spending plans are on course, needing no new taxes; that the dear old ""fundamentals are sound""; that while our share prices are only 48% down, Germany's have tumbled a whopping 67%. But this, alas, is politics, not comparative economics. This is show-business. Listen, therefore, to the dismal tinkle of luck and applause running out.  He said there'd be no more boom and bust. That is not how it feels. He took an early pop at the pension funds. Now they're becoming a national crisis, staggering from pillar to post, demolishing ordinary dreams as they go. Just as the taxation tide turns, so last year's national insurance rises snap into place. Just as the cash for public services comes on stream, so the firemen stoke a different boiler. Just as congestion charges arrive, so the Central line goes awol. And then there is university funding.  Every problem that seemed so breezy when there was growth and confidence, in short, now comes glooming round to Gordon's door. Things could be more awful, naturally. That's always true. Yet lustre, once lost, is powerful hard to get shining again.  In a normal Westminster world, you'd know what would happen next. A threat to the chancellor would be a threat to the prime minister and continuing governance. It would thus be loyally batted away unless (like Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson) ritual sacrifices were more the order of the day. A chancellor is there to be defended until it's time, in extremis, to ditch him. But Mr Brown and Mr Blair don't live in a ""normal"" world.  They are both big beasts. Almost a decade ago, they sat over lunch in Islington and made the Granita accord. I won't stand against you for Labour leader (and thus prospective PM) if you quit half-way through your second term and let me have a go. Was it ever quite as neat as that? The old Granita restaurant was a famously noisy, clattery place. Maybe Tony dropped his bread roll at the wrong moment? Maybe Gordon found a fly in his soup? Still ... the legend and the black looks live on.  What we've had for almost six years now isn't the traditional line of command, prime minister down to chancellor, but more a division of the Whitehall realm into two rival kingdoms. The leaders have their own camps and followers. They jockey, needle and probe. They are allies in public and snarlers or sniffers behind the arras. Like North and South Korea, they always need watching. And it's Granita time, time to move over. High noon.  But is Mr Blair going to pack his bags and, like Peter Foster, depart for distant parts? Of course not. That was always an illusion. A disastrous war in Iraq might carry him off - but, in harsh practicality if not morality, it's far more likely that Saddam will crumple and a string of Iraqi scientists thereafter bear witness to the horrors averted. There's no alternative to a continuing Tony. There are, however, plenty of reasons why a continuing Gordon may not be so fireproof. Who wants a magician who's lost his wand? Who wants a baleful, brooding problem when fresh starts are easier?  It is because the realm was divided, because the pieces were scrapped over and parcelled out, that Gordon Brown is suddenly so vulnerable. Traditionally, when a prime minister has a night of the long knives with his neighbour, it is the PM's own status and policies that also appear in the frame. Sacking has its costs. But here the equation is different. Because Brown manifestly runs his own five tests, his own prescriptions for the markets, his own private funding initiatives and target-setting squads, because they are his and not Blair's, so the policies and the man can be simultaneously removed without that damage: a liberation rather than an assassination.  Would there be crisis and flak when the moment came? Inescapably. But it would also set the prime minister free, on course to be his own man with his own chancellor for a third term. It would allow New Labour a new beginning. And to see the logic, you need only consider the alternative: no change, no joy, animosity as usual. Who can possibly settle for another six years of this? Who would want to?  There's the fault with Mr Brown. He shouldn't have believed his own publicity. He should have shifted himself, in triumph, to foreign secretary or deputy PM a year ago. He should have remained forever Mr Boom not Mr Bust. He should have known that, like Jim Callaghan, his time would come if he was loyal and efficient and on the team, not a king over the water. He should, simply, have been smarter."

Everything and nothing.  Start with the nothing. The battle to be prime minister comes down to two candidates, former PM Binyamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu of Likud and current foreign minister Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  As the race between the two has tightened, with the last polls showing only a two-seat gap between them, the pair have scrambled to define themselves more sharply. ""Livni at last let the word peace come out of her mouth,"" says Aluf Benn of the liberal daily Haaretz, while ""Bibi planted a tree in the Golan [Heights] and went for a walkabout in East Jerusalem.""  In those moves, Livni and Netanyahu were both acting out age-old roles, the peace candidate doing battle with the hawk. But no one seriously believes that Livni is about to deliver an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty, just as no one kids themselves that Bibi is going to realise the now-fading Likud dream of Greater Israel. Instead, in the words of one senior Israeli official, ""Whoever wins, it will be more of the same: convergence on the pragmatic centre."" If Livni were somehow to pull off a double upset, emerging with both the most seats and a presidential invitation to form a government  and the latter does not automatically follow the former  she would continue in the same vein as the outgoing Olmert administration she served: more talks with the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, more of the Annapolis process started in November 2007 and more isolation of Hamas.  Netanyahu's rhetoric has been different, ruling out any compromise on Jerusalem and still refusing to accept a Palestinian state. But were he to return to the prime minister's office, few believe he would maintain that hard line. First, he will look leftward for coalition partners, preferring to be the hawk in a centrist government than the centrist in an ultra-hawkish one. He knows that his relationship with the US  which matters more to Israeli leaders than almost anything else  will be doomed if he becomes the prisoner of rightist parties, constantly demanding settlement expansion and the like.  The result will be that Netanyahu, too, will stay on the Annapolis track, continuing to negotiate with the PA. The tone will be different from Livni's  though some say Netanyahu might even end up yielding more than she would. First, because he will be anxious, in Benn's words, ""to prove to world opinion that he is not a monster"" and, second, because his vision of ""economic peace"" calls for nurturing prosperity on the West Bank, and that must entail reducing the number of checkpoints that currently restrict Palestinian movement so badly.  Hence the impression that there's not much difference at the top  and next to nothing at stake. And yet, others say something very profound is on the line in this election, their angst stirred by the rise and rise of the man set to claim third place and the role of kingmaker: Avigdor Lieberman. A nationalist to his friends, a racist to his enemies, the Russian-born Lieberman poses as an Israeli Putin, the strongman saviour Israel is crying out for. His signature proposal is to remove the citizenship of anyone who refuses to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: his target is clearly the 1.45m Palestinian Arabs who live as citizens inside Israel proper. Many liberals laugh off Lieberman as an opportunist, insisting that his loyalty oath plan will come to nothing. But others tremble at the toxicity he has unleashed.  Asked what's at stake in this election, one scholar at Tel Aviv University answered instantly: ""Israel's soul."

Our erstwhile ""natural party of government"" does not expect to win the next election (or, perhaps, the one after that). It's down there in the pits, snarling at the Liberal Democrats, trying to hang on to second place. Even today, through a winter of liverish complaint, it is still failing. But at least abandoning immediate hope is a start. Indeed, Iain Duncan Smith - enduring yet another TV re-relaunch with Frost yesterday - seemed to go out of his way to play Charlie Kennedy without the jokes. He talked only about ""alternative"" policies (to be formulated) and a ""strong, clear sense of direction"" (to be be discovered). His claim to credibility (pure Lib Demery) rested on the supposedly mighty achievements of Tory councils out there in the wide blue yonder, so many of them apparently that few more could be expected in May. The phrase ""when I'm prime minister..."" never crossed his dry, pursed lips.  A turning point. The Conservatives have spent almost six years pretending that Blair and New Labour are merely some brief aberration, a hiccup amid continuing hegemony. They picked William Hague because he was the obvious young pretender, the inheritor. Then they sucked their thumbs and picked Duncan Smith. Now ""desperate Tory MPs"" (according to the Daily Telegraph) are hunting round for some ""men in grey suits"" to give IDS the push. Darkness without much sight of dawn, and six wasted years.  There will doubtless be war in Iraq this year, but there will be no euro referendum. Tony Blair has his own problems. He's wasted his extra layers of popularity. But what does that mean for the Tories?  It means that, at last, they have to be serious. Ken Clarke was the only serious runner in 1997. No go: a no-no on Europe. The assumption, remember, was that somehow the Tories would be swiftly back in office, so couldn't be led by some Brussels-truckling bruiser. And 2001? The same delusion ruled in the end. Duncan Smith's main selling point (with the Telegraph, among others) was that he wasn't Ken.  Yet, with only a thin smear of hindsight, there never was going to be a referendum during Labour's first term. Gordon Brown had got his fix in. And the second term is merely a re-run in less propitious circumstances. Will a third term look any better? Not if the big majorities have begun to shrivel. Not if the Conservatives begin to look remotely electable again. Not if what we fondly remember as ""real politics"" is coming back.  Take a real politician. Kenneth Clarke, now well into his 60s, is never going to be prime minister. He won't be available in 2010. He isn't the man for the long haul. But he is still - just about - the man to rough up a government losing its confidence and way as fatigue starts to gnaw. He knows about running Treasuries and Home Offices and Health and Education. Been there, done that.  Nobody has to look at him, as they do at IDS, and wonder how he would cope. If the job is effective opposition, making up lost ground, bringing a few talented people distantly remembered back on to the front bench, then he remains the obvious choice. If they'd picked him for 2001, then Labour would already be breathing less easily - and 2005 or 2006 would look much more problematic.  But it's surely too late for any of that. Iain Duncan Smith isn't going to fall on his sword because Lord Black of Crossharbour comes calling. The ""Hague rules"" for electing a new leader are death to men in grey suits. The next election is lost and the only remaining question is: how badly? And that is where any sensible party, gradually recovering its scattered wits, would start to think hard.  The job next time is damage limitation. The essential task is seeing off the Liberal Democrats. (Not so easy if Charlie, rather bravely, turns out to have called Iraq right.) The true focus is on the future, on 2010. That may not be instant politics as we know them, a shift to some distant time frame. It may be not suit what remains of the Tory press - ludicrously hailing Bush for his billions in tax cuts and deficits.  The Conservatives won't get another new leader in midstream. They could, however, get a deputy leader, a leader in waiting for next time round. Say Oliver Letwin. They could actually start to develop policies which will have resonance during Labour's third term (when the money has gone in properly and public services are either better or worse). They could resolve their tangle over reduced taxation or increased provision with something a bit more solid than phrase-making.  They could, in short, look serious again by admitting what they seriously know in their hearts: that this is the longest haul, without quick fixes. That, compared with all the toil Neil Kinnock endured, they haven't even begun."

Lauren Wright has blonde bunches caught in rosebud ribbons. The girls' school photos, shot in a rare instant of peace or pretence, bear no relationship to the reality of their lives. One child was left in a sack of excrement in a cold bath; the other was pulverised like steak on a butcher's slab and left to die. In the face of such incomprehensible brutality, the pictures tell a simpler horror story. A murderous great-aunt adjusted the yellow hair ties. A killer stepmother fixed the rosebud ribbons. The clash of normality and evil appals and also, in some curious way, absolves us. We are detached and at a loss to comprehend.  Such wickedness, we think, does not brush ordinary lives. It does now. The Climbi inquiry is a recital of blight and official blindness in the anonymous inner city. The case of Lauren Wright demonstrates how a peaceful Norfolk village, with a church, an ivy-clad pub and 300 inhabitants, can double as a torture chamber. Neighbours and teachers looked on as Lauren's weight fell and her bruises spread. Tracey Wright, a playground helper, felt sufficiently emboldened by communitarian spirit to brutalise her in public and encourage her own children to spit in their stepsister's face.   What sort of a woman commits such atrocities? Cruel, sadistic, not clever but very cunning. And familiar. The monstrous mother has existed since the time of Euripides and before. While Tracey Wright may not qualify as a modern   Medea, she is a recognisable figure in the canon of evil. Nor is there anything new in the modern continuum of child torture. Every week in Britain, at least one child dies at the hands of a parent or carer. As the NSPCC points out, the roll call of child killing has continued uninterrupted since Maria Colwell was murdered in the early 70s. For all the reforms and promises, we have made no impact at all.   But the culture that spawns viciousness evolves in terrifying ways. It seems unbelievable that those who watched Lauren suffer could shuffle their feet, like awkward spectators at a stranger's deathbed, as a child was inched towards her grave. It is unspeakable, too, that social services should lace their culpability with such cynicism. The official valediction to brief lives now contains two strands. First, supply extra money, or expect more deaths. The second message, whispered as the Climbi inquiry continues, is that professionals should not have their errors paraded, lest potential care workers shun this blighted system.   Such arguments brand at-risk children as economic bait. It is, however, true that the Government is so miserly on child protection that English authorities have overspent by 500 million this year, just to provide the thin back-up that allowed Lauren and Victoria's killings. Diverting money into favoured, and successful, Government initiatives, such as Sure Start, means less for basic services. Promises to eradicate child poverty, linked closely to neglect, sound hopeful, but 4.3 million British children remain poor. The Prime Minister lauds America, where the impoverished black child may aspire to high office. We shall see soon how the Colin Powell model will play out here.   Poverty is not the only issue. Nor is a pernicious minority of brutes who torture children the sole problem, though it is the least tractable. Michael Stone, the murderer of Lin and Megan Russell and a man no doubt immortalised some where in a sweet-faced school snapshot, was beaten by his stepfather at the age of one and abused by social workers. We understand how to create monsters. We do not know how to redeem them. Notions of parenting classes for the inadequate are little more than a sop for middle class do-gooders with the warm idea that cruelty is amenable to the intervention of a Dr Spockish government.   But the state is a dreadful parent. It is responsible for care home scandals. It presides,  in loco parentis, over the young offenders' institutions that, for all the warnings, still corrupt and kill. We weep, rightly, for murdered toddlers, but children discovered hanging in a Feltham cell die without public lament or remark. What binds such victims to each other, and to all those whose lives will never be corroded by cruelty, is absence of power.   Adults see children as their property. The law is cavalier. A child can be arrested and strip-searched at 10 but not interviewed by police until he or she is 14. Children can drink alcohol at five but not buy a pet kitten before the age of 12. It took until last year for the Home Office to issue guidance that child prostitutes were abuse victims, not criminals. A few weeks ago Scotland announced its plan to outlaw smacking for the under-threes. Westminster proposals are imminent, and child protection charities fear that a government that recently sanctioned smacking by childminders might restrict the ban to babies only.   Outlawing smacking altogether is imperative. Those who hesitated to report Tracey Wright as she went about the legalised business of battering her child might have thought again. Such a ban would also impact on parents, Blair and   Blunkett included, who see no great harm in a remedial swipe. It would symbolise a fairer world for children and end the idea that Article 12 of the Human Rights Convention is, like recorder lessons and broccoli, desirable but inessential.   A lack of rights for children drives society's failings. That absence feeds the confidence of torturers, the apathy of protectors and the vagueness of government reformers. It underpins the cruel practice of keeping children with their birth parents when all reason and humanity demands their removal. It genuflects to the madness of a system in which it is legal to assault a child but not a grown-up. It makes adults, the monstrous and the kind alike, complicit in neglect.   So, reform the child care system. Have a Children's Commissioner, as the NSPCC and others demand. But a slicker, more accountable structure will not be enough. We have the worst child poverty and infant mortality rates in Europe. A quarter of recorded rape victims are children. One in five children is mentally ill. Another child will be killed by a parent before this week is over. The charge sheet, if there ever is one, is likely to say manslaughter, not murder. The presumption is that the premeditated slaughter of a child is a lesser crime. What are the remedies against such horrors?   'We deserve to know why,' Lauren's MP said, as she demanded an inquiry into her death. But we do know why. And the lesson, not yet absorbed, of Victoria's and Lauren's deaths is that children, not adults, are the deserving ones. They need more rights, more legal protection, more compassion. They need more than old stereotypes of evil and of innocence. They need solutions to disaster that go beyond a tired litany of official regret laced with laments on overwork. They deserve better than a society that turns its back on the ugly fate of living children while weeping at the beauty of the dead."
1,"There may, at last, be the beginning of wisdom. Our erstwhile ""natural party of government"" does not expect to win the next election (or, perhaps, the one after that). It's down there in the pits, snarling at the Liberal Democrats, trying to hang on to second place. Even today, through a winter of liverish complaint, it is still failing. But at least abandoning immediate hope is a start. Indeed, Iain Duncan Smith - enduring yet another TV re-relaunch with Frost yesterday - seemed to go out of his way to play Charlie Kennedy without the jokes. He talked only about ""alternative"" policies (to be formulated) and a ""strong, clear sense of direction"" (to be be discovered). His claim to credibility (pure Lib Demery) rested on the supposedly mighty achievements of Tory councils out there in the wide blue yonder, so many of them apparently that few more could be expected in May. The phrase ""when I'm prime minister..."" never crossed his dry, pursed lips.  A turning point. The Conservatives have spent almost six years pretending that Blair and New Labour are merely some brief aberration, a hiccup amid continuing hegemony. They picked William Hague because he was the obvious young pretender, the inheritor. Then they sucked their thumbs and picked Duncan Smith. Now ""desperate Tory MPs"" (according to the Daily Telegraph) are hunting round for some ""men in grey suits"" to give IDS the push. Darkness without much sight of dawn, and six wasted years.  There will doubtless be war in Iraq this year, but there will be no euro referendum. Tony Blair has his own problems. He's wasted his extra layers of popularity. But what does that mean for the Tories?  It means that, at last, they have to be serious. Ken Clarke was the only serious runner in 1997. No go: a no-no on Europe. The assumption, remember, was that somehow the Tories would be swiftly back in office, so couldn't be led by some Brussels-truckling bruiser. And 2001? The same delusion ruled in the end. Duncan Smith's main selling point (with the Telegraph, among others) was that he wasn't Ken.  Yet, with only a thin smear of hindsight, there never was going to be a referendum during Labour's first term. Gordon Brown had got his fix in. And the second term is merely a re-run in less propitious circumstances. Will a third term look any better? Not if the big majorities have begun to shrivel. Not if the Conservatives begin to look remotely electable again. Not if what we fondly remember as ""real politics"" is coming back.  Take a real politician. Kenneth Clarke, now well into his 60s, is never going to be prime minister. He won't be available in 2010. He isn't the man for the long haul. But he is still - just about - the man to rough up a government losing its confidence and way as fatigue starts to gnaw. He knows about running Treasuries and Home Offices and Health and Education. Been there, done that.  Nobody has to look at him, as they do at IDS, and wonder how he would cope. If the job is effective opposition, making up lost ground, bringing a few talented people distantly remembered back on to the front bench, then he remains the obvious choice. If they'd picked him for 2001, then Labour would already be breathing less easily - and 2005 or 2006 would look much more problematic.  But it's surely too late for any of that. Iain Duncan Smith isn't going to fall on his sword because Lord Black of Crossharbour comes calling. The ""Hague rules"" for electing a new leader are death to men in grey suits. The next election is lost and the only remaining question is: how badly? And that is where any sensible party, gradually recovering its scattered wits, would start to think hard.  The job next time is damage limitation. The essential task is seeing off the Liberal Democrats. (Not so easy if Charlie, rather bravely, turns out to have called Iraq right.) The true focus is on the future, on 2010. That may not be instant politics as we know them, a shift to some distant time frame. It may be not suit what remains of the Tory press - ludicrously hailing Bush for his billions in tax cuts and deficits.  The Conservatives won't get another new leader in midstream. They could, however, get a deputy leader, a leader in waiting for next time round. Say Oliver Letwin. They could actually start to develop policies which will have resonance during Labour's third term (when the money has gone in properly and public services are either better or worse). They could resolve their tangle over reduced taxation or increased provision with something a bit more solid than phrase-making.  They could, in short, look serious again by admitting what they seriously know in their hearts: that this is the longest haul, without quick fixes. That, compared with all the toil Neil Kinnock endured, they haven't even begun.","John Major started it with his potty ""family values"" crusade. Thou shalt not fall into bed with the wrong woman and remain a member of my blokeish government. (Shurrup, Edwina!) But prime ministerial pottiness is ever with us. Who, doe-eyed and dripping sincerity, invited our trust - and made himself the ultimate repository of that virtue? Tony Blair. So who now lives or dies on the red line he created?Pause, though, for pottiness is a three-syllable word of some complexity. Major wasn't daft to go back to basics per se; he was crazy to let his moral musings turn into a kind of ministerial code of toe-sucking practice. The truth was then, is now and must indelibly remain that politicians are just ordinary men and women, people like us, people no better than we ought to be. Jawbone them about fornication to your heart's content, but don't make silly, rigid rules that will inevitably - in ordinary, lustful humanity - be broken. That's potty.And trust - after seven years of bitter examination - is just the same, a plastic plant plonked in a flowerpot from some Daily Mail Ideal Home exhibition. The modern Mail, remember, deals in absolutes. Absolute family harmony or perfidy? A Major-type choice. Complete trust in our leaders or another pile of overspun horse manure from Mendacity Inc? It's a phoney construction, but a hugely powerful one: and we've swallowed it hook, line and stinker.Of course politicians, for a while at least, revel in public trust. Leaders great or small always like the adoration of the led. But try injecting another dose of ordinary humanity into that argument.Trust is a relative, nuanced thing. You may or may not trust your neighbour to feed the cat while you're away. It depends on the neighbour. You may or may not tell the local police you're going on holiday. That depends on what happened last time you went to Majorca. Who trusts a boss in a pay negotiation who says he's run out of money on day two? Or a union leader who promises to pull down the pillars then settles behind the arras?Would I trust the present Archbishop of Canterbury to be strong, consistent and stalwart over gay bishops? I'd be a fool if I did. Or the Cantuar just past, peddling an autobiography, to stay mum about Charles and Camilla? Ditto. Or Andy Gilchrist to hang tough when the fires of fury burned too high? Ditto - or however they say that in Portuguese.Trust is a matter of individual judgment and experience. If you work in an office, look round and categorise the people at the next desks. (No: of course you've done that long since, the first of the necessary work skills learned, office politics.) So why on earth should trust in politicians or governments, in prime ministers themselves, come as a job lot of pretty packages? It's an utterly false dichotomy. It carves professional politics away from politics day-to-day and seeks to bathe it in an artificially kindly light.You may trust doctors, but not Harold Shipman. Academic publishers, but not Robert Maxwell. Presidents of the US, but not ... oh, forget it! Some of the time, out in the back garden smoking a surreptitious fag, you may not even trust yourself.The point - the critical point - about any blanket concept of trust is the way it creates a Daily Mail kind of world. They, those bigwigs over there, are the leaders, and we gave them our trust. We, us lot over here, have been lied to and traduced ever since, suckers, victims, neglected pawns. See: the construct assumes that we are fools, self-deluding, malleable idiots incapable of doing what we do naturally in everyday life - thinking, assessing, making our own choices.There's something convenient, in a fast-food sort of way, about that divide, of course. It means we never have to admit that we, personally, might have got an issue wrong. We were ""lied to"" over WMD, and so need never grow introspective about what we'd have done on the information then available. We marched and were spurned. Fine, but blamefests come too damn easy.Throughout Europe, eight days ago, politicians in power got a rare old roasting from electorates oozing distrust. Same here: we put our faith in Robert Kilroy-Silk, maybe because Jerry Springer wasn't standing. Last week in Brussels, Blair tried ""his cynical ploy"" of ""making as much fuss about a number of red lines as possible"" and ""keeping very quiet about the other issues he wasn't going to win"". How do I know that? Because the Mail's main European ""analyst"" told me before the essential bargaining had even started. Never let facts or contemporaneous reporting get in the way of received opinion.This isn't, you may be relieved to hear, yet another column arguing for or against Europe membership. Leave that for the relevant time. What it is, though, is a shivering apprehension of debates that matter conducted in gimcrack stereotypes to barely hidden agendas.The cry from core Labour now is still ""Trust Tony"" - with an anxious descant demanding to know whether Tony can ever regain such trust. Of course he can't. Such trust is a plastic plant in a plastic pot. It can't be summoned on demand or glued back together.But this trust is anyway a worthless commodity. Its manifest lack didn't wreck Lloyd George or SuperMac or the wizard called Wilson. Nobody gave it to Bill Clinton (though he was more poll popular when he left office than Ronald Reagan). Nobody in full sentience would dream of trusting Charlie Kennedy to tell the same story in Aberdeen and Penzance - or Michael Howard to explain why he sacked the head of the prison service. Too much ado about synthetic sincerity. Trust me, I'm not a politician."

That, compared with all the toil Neil Kinnock endured, they haven't even begun.","Four weeks after the election and it almost might not have happened. If elections are meant to bring an infusion of energy to the body politic, this one, seat for seat, was the deadest in living memory. This is not another treatise on the apathy of the voters, but is prompted by something scarier: the desiccated inanition, the droning indecision, of ministers. What a second dose of power seems to have done to them is not renew their purpose but redouble the unbearable caution which, in the first term, persuaded us to suspend every expectation. No sooner have they got back than they've started again on the long haul through the cliches of postponement until the end of the day when the dust never settles. Consider Stephen Byers, secretary of state for transport and a few other things. On Sunday, he had eight minutes on David Frost's sofa to state his case. His field of responsibility is in massive crisis. Transport affects the lives of far more people than either health or education. Rail service is collapsing, roads are slowing down, the London tube is going nowhere. We need to know what Byers will do. Instead we heard a man supremely complacent in the utter emptiness of what he had to say.  Asked about the trains, he admitted things were grim. But he was going to take command. ""It's my responsibility to change that round and really give the industry a sense of focus and do the simple things,"" he grandly said. ""Get trains running on time, safely, and comfortable. That's what the travelling public want."" This was a startling insight. But how would he get the railway people to comply? ""By saying to them they've got to focus on delivering the 10-year plan,"" he puffed. ""And it's got to be done quickly, because travellers were fed up with the industry blaming other people and not taking responsibility.""  This minister knows plenty about not taking responsibility. It is the kernel of his purpose. He was going to get on to Railtrack, he said. Railtrack would be pulling the operating companies together ""to work out a new way forward"". And Byers himself? The imperious command to Railtrack went forth from the Sunday sofa. They must, the minister insisted, ""do that sooner rather than later"". And if this didn't work? ""There'll be more announcements in the next few weeks about the powers that we are using.""  Not even the scandalous million-pound pay-off to Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's disgraced former chairman, could stimulate what might remain of Stephen Byers' capacity to share the indignation of the millions of travellers who now depend on him. When Frost put the question to him, he ran like a neutered rabbit to his burrow. That's not an issue for the secretary of state, he burbled. It was up to the shareholders. But isn't the government, in a way, the biggest shareholder? He was proud enough to say that ""we are making significant investment in Railtrack"", yet didn't seem to see any connection between this fact and the need to account, as a Labour minister, for Corbett's disgustingly generous treatment.  On petrol, we were offered the astounding dictum that ""the British public will not tolerate a price for fuel which is excessive"". On the tube, ""we need to rule out privatisation"" - as if anyone was any longer contemplating it. Throughout the piece, Byers sat in perfect comfort, oblivious to the embarrassment he deserved to feel, no doubt thinking he was doing well, shameless in his refusal to engage with a single policy question, unaware that he epitomised the worst of everything about New Labour: patronising, secretive, indecisive, terrified of breaking with the party line - a line whose commonest ingredient is that nothing should be said.  Watching this performance, I saw more clearly some of the characteristics of this government which, during the second term, seem likely to make us love it less and less.  First, it contains few ministers of any scale. Here was an experienced Cabinet minister who didn't have a single interesting idea about his new job. Like most of them, he is driven by the short-term news agenda, which means essentially remaining in defensive mode at all times. It's all that bothers him. Robin Cook and Clare Short rise above this, and David Blunkett may learn to. But Lord Chancellor Irvine has gone silent for years. The Byers approach, positively yearning for grey anonymity, is the template. The notion of the politician as leader, as challenger of received opinion, as generator of daring debate, is unimaginable in the cohorts of New Labour.  Second, this is a style not merely encouraged but insisted on by the only two ministers who are allowed to matter, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been the feature of their duumvirate.Fighting the battles in the war before last, they insist especially that there must be no perceived disagreements - except the ones they can't conceal between themselves. In most departments, no minister is supposed to have an idea that one of the two duumvirs hasn't had first - or at any rate run through every kind of personal security check.  This breeds a crippling shortage of political imagination. Blairites are a generation of timid politicians. For all I know, Stephen Byers may be a one-man cauldron of creativity. But he never lets it show. The retreat into committees and commissions and proposals ""coming forward"" and plans ""we may look at"" and all the other artefacts of unripe time is a move he makes by reflex instinct.   This is the style that comes from Blair's insistence on bilateral agreement rather than collective discussion, and from Brown's tireless efforts to impose a regime of fear. The hidden presence on Frost's sofa, ensuring that Byers made a fool of himself whenever he was asked to address the voters' concerns about transport, was the chancellor of the exchequer.  Third, though, we do have to return to apathy. The low voter turnout at the election, it is sometimes said, diminished Labour's mandate. I've heard it cited as a reason for the government to resume the ultra-caution with which it conducted itself from 1997 to 2001. This seems precisely the opposite of the truth. If there's a connection, it works the other way. It's the very timidity of ministers, their corporate greyness, the fact that the Cabinet has barely two personalities to rub together, which finds its echo in the electorate. If ministers are run according to a strategy that favours robotic vacuity on the part of almost all of them, why should the voters be expected to take them seriously enough to perform their own part in the democratic process?  The Byers performance was a little Sunday insult. Evidently it's the norm we're meant to accept, from a government that faces no political pressure except that which comes from its own failure to solve problems. It doesn't enlist people's support, but treats them as the enemy, in need of reassurance without promises, and condescension without commitment. I still believe the government can do better than that. But it has to be admitted that the first four weeks have set a style that seems to say the end of the day will never really come."
1,"I am absolutely certain that, sometime during last year, Norman Baker - the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes - exposed what he regarded as a political scandal and that, in consequence, he appeared on television for several consecutive days. As I cannot recall what the so-called cause clbre concerned, I assume that it did not have a lasting effect on the life of the nation. But it certainly had an effect on Mr Baker. He developed a taste for unearthing impropriety. Last week, the Sussex Savonarola dug out details of the prime minister's Egyptian holiday. The mining metaphor is not altogether appropriate. For what Mr Baker believed to be dirt was buried in the public pages of the Register of Members' Interests. Tony Blair had, therefore, already announced that the Cairo government had paid part of the cost of the holiday in Sharm el-Sheikh and that he had made a donation of an equivalent amount to an Egyptian charity. By denouncing the arrangement as ""cheapening the office of prime minister"", Mr Baker cheapened the whole business of politics.  Politicians who are determined to say something, but have nothing of value to say, have developed the unhealthy habit of accusing their opponents of corruption, certain that - justified or not - their allegations will be reported. Last week some silly ass suggested that, because she lives in Downing Street, Cherie Blair offended against the rules of propriety by seeing her professional colleagues and clients in her own home. It is all part of the degeneration of politics from arguments about conflicting policies to claims about rival personalities.  Last week's example of that unhappy trend was the revelation - soon after the government had announced its intentions to relax the gaming laws - that the Labour party had accepted a donation of 100,000 from Peter Coates, the owner of a company called Provincial Racing. All the commentators could think of was the possibility that the gambling free-for-all was intended to repay Mr Coates's generosity. The real explanation is less sinister but equally disturbing. Indeed to me, it is rather worse than ""cash for legislation"". A corrupt government might change its ways. One which has abandoned its philosophy is more difficult to rehabilitate.  I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Coates's gift had no direct effect on the government's decision to allow gambling of every sort to spread like an infection through Britain. New Labour is not corrupt; its collective sin is the combination of arrogance and naivety which encourages the belief that the world is full of rich men who want to make a selfless contribution to the ""project"". When a donation is handed over, I doubt if the idea that it was written out in the hope of favours passes through the recipient's mind. But I am equally sure that the man who signed the cheque hoped for something in return.  That was certainly the case when the Tories used to complain that the trade unions were Labour's paymasters. Unions raised the political levy and used it to finance a political party which shared their aims and sometimes legislated explicitly on their behalf. That was both legitimate and laudable. Labour had been founded to support their interests and defend the welfare of their members. Even without their subventions, Labour would have initiated policies of which they approved. The party was neither bought nor sold.  There is no legitimate complaint against a vicar who accepts a large donation to his church restoration from a regular worshipper within his parish. If, on the other hand, a payment is made in recognition of the incumbent changing faith - against the wishes of his congregation - the transaction may not be financially corrupt, but it is certainly morally dubious. The payment is being made as a reward for apostasy.  The rector of Downing Street will say that his conversion is genuine - or perhaps that he never believed in the old religion and stumbled into the wrong church by mistake. That is a subject worth reasoned argument. It will not happen while cheap headlines suggest that business is bribing the government. It is not. The payments are a reward for the abandonment of socialism. The companies pay up, as the unions once did, because they think that New Labour is on their side. And, of course, they are right. When Mr Blair cooperates with Silvio Berlusconi to demand a more flexible labour market in Europe, he is making the CBI feel as warm towards him as the TUC felt towards Labour leaders when they promised to repeal the Trades Disputes Act.  Yet New Labour's alliance with industry is hardly, if ever, discussed in ideological terms. Indeed, it only breaks to the surface of most newspapers when it can - usually wholly illegitimately - be described as sleaze. There are just too many Norman Bakers about.","Think of what follows as a Christmas codicil to the splendid and well-deserved assault on columnists which was published in last Tuesday's Guardian. Charitably, Martin Kettle chose not to expose all the weaknesses of the trade. To the sins of ignorance and sloth, he might well have added pomposity - a failing which has been recently displayed in the almost universal complaint that the Liberal leader lacks gravitas. Charles Kennedy has attracted that indictment by performing as temporary chairman of Have I Got News for You? - a task which he discharged with commendable elan. His critics ought to realise that it is his essentially unstatesmanlike persona which makes him popular with the public. His party prospers in the opinion polls because no one could possibly imagine him as a minister - a class of person which is held in universal contempt.  Other politicians could make themselves equally appealing by also insinuating themselves into conventionally unsuitable TV and radio shows. A quick glance at the Radio Times confirms that there are programmes which could easily accommodate everyone who has ever sat on either the government or opposition frontbench.  Beginning with a sure-fire winner, the BBC could broadcast a special edition of Changing Rooms in which Gordon Brown described how he will redecorate 10 Downing Street as soon as he moves in. Tony Blair fronting Neighbours From Hell would then splendidly round off an evening of ""lifestyle"" viewing. To preserve party balance it would be necessary, the next day, for Theresa May to star in Have You Remembered What Not to Wear? followed by Michael Portillo in After They Were Famous. Unfortunately, none of the shadow cabinet would be eligible for an appearance in Friends or Band of Brothers.  Alan Milburn might be regarded as a natural for Casualty. But that slot should be reserved for Peter Mandelson, the only secretary of state in history to become one twice in a single session. No doubt he thinks of himself as ideally suited to You've Been Framed. Milburn should host The National Lottery. Winners would be awarded a place in a foundation hospital, while the losers would be sent to wait for a bed in an understaffed adaptation of a poor law workhouse.  Some of the possible programmes may not be regarded as suitable for transmission before the 9pm watershed. Young and impressionable minds should not, for example, be exposed to Dennis Skinner in The Life of Mammals or Stephen Byers making a brief appearance in They Think It's All Over. It might well be that the broadcasting commission refused to allow Paul ""It's the Way I Tell 'Em"" Boatang to appear in his Max Miller-style suits and perform his well-known imitation of that great comedian in Stars in Their Eyes. But, on the evidence of recent Newsnight appearances, he would be an ideal subject for Red Mist, ""recalling how people react when they are pushed to breaking point.""  Gerald Kaufman already qualifies for membership of one of the teams in The Generation Game. If he stands for re-election again, he may justify an appearance on Antiques Roadshow. It could be followed by John Prescott in Scrapheap Challenge, though I would enjoy his contribution to The Adventure of English. Prescott certainly deserves a supporting role in a special transport department edition of Bitter Inheritance, starring Alistair Darling.

0,"I am absolutely certain that, sometime during last year, Norman Baker - the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes - exposed what he regarded as a political scandal and that, in consequence, he appeared on television for several consecutive days. As I cannot recall what the so-called cause clbre concerned, I assume that it did not have a lasting effect on the life of the nation. But it certainly had an effect on Mr Baker. He developed a taste for unearthing impropriety. Last week, the Sussex Savonarola dug out details of the prime minister's Egyptian holiday. The mining metaphor is not altogether appropriate. For what Mr Baker believed to be dirt was buried in the public pages of the Register of Members' Interests. Tony Blair had, therefore, already announced that the Cairo government had paid part of the cost of the holiday in Sharm el-Sheikh and that he had made a donation of an equivalent amount to an Egyptian charity. By denouncing the arrangement as ""cheapening the office of prime minister"", Mr Baker cheapened the whole business of politics.  Politicians who are determined to say something, but have nothing of value to say, have developed the unhealthy habit of accusing their opponents of corruption, certain that - justified or not - their allegations will be reported. Last week some silly ass suggested that, because she lives in Downing Street, Cherie Blair offended against the rules of propriety by seeing her professional colleagues and clients in her own home. It is all part of the degeneration of politics from arguments about conflicting policies to claims about rival personalities.  Last week's example of that unhappy trend was the revelation - soon after the government had announced its intentions to relax the gaming laws - that the Labour party had accepted a donation of 100,000 from Peter Coates, the owner of a company called Provincial Racing. All the commentators could think of was the possibility that the gambling free-for-all was intended to repay Mr Coates's generosity. The real explanation is less sinister but equally disturbing. Indeed to me, it is rather worse than ""cash for legislation"". A corrupt government might change its ways. One which has abandoned its philosophy is more difficult to rehabilitate.  I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Coates's gift had no direct effect on the government's decision to allow gambling of every sort to spread like an infection through Britain. New Labour is not corrupt; its collective sin is the combination of arrogance and naivety which encourages the belief that the world is full of rich men who want to make a selfless contribution to the ""project"". When a donation is handed over, I doubt if the idea that it was written out in the hope of favours passes through the recipient's mind. But I am equally sure that the man who signed the cheque hoped for something in return.  That was certainly the case when the Tories used to complain that the trade unions were Labour's paymasters. Unions raised the political levy and used it to finance a political party which shared their aims and sometimes legislated explicitly on their behalf. That was both legitimate and laudable. Labour had been founded to support their interests and defend the welfare of their members. Even without their subventions, Labour would have initiated policies of which they approved. The party was neither bought nor sold.  There is no legitimate complaint against a vicar who accepts a large donation to his church restoration from a regular worshipper within his parish. If, on the other hand, a payment is made in recognition of the incumbent changing faith - against the wishes of his congregation - the transaction may not be financially corrupt, but it is certainly morally dubious. The payment is being made as a reward for apostasy.  The rector of Downing Street will say that his conversion is genuine - or perhaps that he never believed in the old religion and stumbled into the wrong church by mistake. That is a subject worth reasoned argument. It will not happen while cheap headlines suggest that business is bribing the government. It is not. The payments are a reward for the abandonment of socialism. The companies pay up, as the unions once did, because they think that New Labour is on their side. And, of course, they are right. When Mr Blair cooperates with Silvio Berlusconi to demand a more flexible labour market in Europe, he is making the CBI feel as warm towards him as the TUC felt towards Labour leaders when they promised to repeal the Trades Disputes Act.  Yet New Labour's alliance with industry is hardly, if ever, discussed in ideological terms. Indeed, it only breaks to the surface of most newspapers when it can - usually wholly illegitimately - be described as sleaze. There are just too many Norman Bakers about.","When ticking off the media for their 'corrosive' cynicism, Prince Charles likes to quote the last lines of  Middlemarch. His fondness for this hymn to unsung heroes must mean he thinks George Eliot an ally in bolstering respect for the monarchy. Perhaps the prince does not know that she was much more subversive than the torpid hordes now declining to make jellies for the jubilee. During a flirtation with republicanism, Eliot referred to Victoria, her contemporary and sometime fan, as 'our little humbug of a queen'. Which just shows that you are never safe from cynics. Charles Clarke thinks elements of the press are 'actually about promotion of cynicism'. Tony Blair, on his recent visit to Africa, lambasted 'the cynics back home'. Greg 'cut the crap' Dyke offers yellow cards to can't-do sceptics on his staff, and Gavyn Davies berates 'white, middle-class, middle-aged' whingers complaining about dumbing down the BBC. Alas, Mr Davies's tirade has only invoked a further flurry of cynicism from those who fear that, if Rolf Harris is the jewel of arts programming, it cannot be long before nu-metal band Slipknot is kicking Saint-Sans off Radio 3.  We are losing faith in old institutions, and they are losing faith in us. Early next month, the political philosopher Onora O'Neill will address the first of her BBC Reith lectures to the collapse of trust between the British people and the Civil Service, the medical profession, politicians, church and business. It is not certain what Lord Reith might have thought of Mr Dyke's 'Operation Top   Dog' fact-finding trip to the United States, complete with a stay in a hotel reportedly favoured by Mick Jagger. Nor is it known what Baroness O'Neill, a latter-day Kantian and Lords cross-bencher, will make of her subject matter. I hope she calls it for the cynics.  Cynicism is the fuel of public life. When political ideology and money get sparse, it is a prime deliverer of standards and probity. Blind trust in business is, post-Enron, only for the gullible and shredder salesmen. Unquestioning belief in doctors led to abysmal regulation and arrogance. Those are replaced now, thanks to cynicism, with greater transparency, convictions for the Dewhurst branch of gynaecology, plus the hope that babies are no longer likely to be killed at Bristol or bottled at Alder Hey.  But for cynicism, we might marvel at the altruism of Edward and Sophie, believe that Signor Berlusconi is the new prophet of workplace fairness and trust that women who use the right brand of shampoo can rely on mermaid hair. No wonder politicians search for the elixir of squandered faith.  Too late. Cynicism is the new politics, and how useful it can be to Ministers professing to abhor it. In an age of innocence, Mr Blair's endorsement of creationist teaching at Emmanuel School in Gateshead would be truly worrying. Now it matters less that children, as neo-Darwinians such as Richard Dawkins rightly protest, are being fed 'ludicrous falsehoods'.  The failsafe is that children, even sheltered ones, are cynical rationalists. The debate between evolution and creation was settled, for good and in the former's favour, in the 1860 Oxford debate between between T.H. Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce. Any teacher now hopeful of persuading streetwise Limp Bizkit fans that God created the world quicker than Glenys Kinnock can rustle up a Fray Bentos supper is likely also to believe in Santa Claus.  But politicians think scepticism a sin to be excised. There is something sly, cynical even, in their attempts to re-engage an electorate of whom fewer than 60 per cent voted in the last election. (Even this figure is less worrying in the context of Robert Mugabe's 112 per cent turn-out in some polling stations, but that is by the way.) Moves towards e-democracy and away from in-your-face campaigning are about machinery, not message. Nor do Ministers acknowledge their own double standard. Apathy, the hated twin of cynicism, is the Ritalin of the masses and thus the drug of political dreams.  If people were as apathetic as politicians complain, there would have been no fuel protests, no anti-globalisation marches, no MMR furore, no Garbagegate. While not all of these are desirable, they demonstrate plenty of engagement in politics. It's just all the wrong sort, supposedly practised by selfish, embittered carpers encouraged to stick the boot into the corpse of deference by a cynical media in thrall to New Cynicism.  Old cynicism looked different. The founder of the Cynic sect, Antisthenes, was a fifth-century BC philosopher so avid for moral wisdom that he travelled every day from Piraeus to Athens (tricky by public transport, even in pre-Byers times) to hear Socrates speak. His disciples' code of strict religious observance, ragged cloaks and revolt against decadence seems, give or take Mittalgate, pink pinstripes by Sir Paul Smith and a BlairForce One jet (cancelled), more in tune with the pious ways of political leaders than with the electorate. Who are the real cynics now?  It's hard to judge, when each side thinks the other so corrupted. The certainty is that politicians have not grasped that the British electorate, while abhorring mendacity and sleaze, prefers cynicism to zealotry in its leaders. Morality drives Tony Blair to support currently indefensible action against Iraq. George Bush, a President of unimpeachable godliness, maintains his   axis of good by tearing up weapons treaties and sending a mentally-ill mother who killed her children to jail for 40 years. If this is virtue, one can only wonder what terrors Saddam's evil entails.  We will have to keep on guessing. The dossier that appalled Mr Bush and Mr Blair is locked in Dick Cheney's briefcase, to be fluttered in front of Middle Eastern leaders who seemed suspiciously unscandalised by the Vice-President's proof. In less doubting times, any government move towards military action against Iraq would be deemed as scrupulously tested as a Which? best-buy toasted-sandwich maker. Instead, there is scant enthusiasm. So thank heavens for cynicism, the province of satirists from Molire to Wilde and the last long-stop of democracy. We are going to need it.  That doesn't mean that Mr Blair fails wholly to understand public disillusion. In his convincing speech at the LSE, the Prime Minister ditched the messianic, rabbit-out-of-the-hat salvationism pitched somewhere between Martin Luther King and Paul Daniels. His gospel of public service delivery won't enthuse potential voters, any more than Barcelona smallprint will captivate those stuck on a commuter train at Luton Parkway. But as a move towards the more sober dialogue the Government wants, calm objectives beat both hot rhetoric and the anti-media witchhunts so popular with Ministers and royalty.  As Charles should consider next time he dusts off his  Middlemarch, such tactics offer an uncomfortable echo of Jonathan Aitken's promise to beat 'bent and twisted journalism' with his 'simple sword of truth'. Establishment moaners will have to find a better remedy against public scornfulness. It would be helpful to Mr Blair if young people were inspired by activism, but grassroots politics, like Passing Cloud cigarettes and jitterbugging, is a redundant craving. Enthusing voters will become easy only when government rebrands cynicism as the manna it professes to crave; the holy grail of reasoned opposition."
1,"Think of what follows as a Christmas codicil to the splendid and well-deserved assault on columnists which was published in last Tuesday's Guardian.

Merry Christmas","It was Geoffrey Hoon who converted and convinced me. Six weeks ago, in this column, I described myself as an unlikely hawk. And until last Thursday evening, a hawk of sorts I remained. For I accepted the doctrine of the pre-emptive strike - the right of a nation under threat to take early action against a potential aggressor. I still do. But when I heard the secretary of state for defence - appearing on a special edition of Question Time - give the official explanation of why military action against Baghdad might be a regrettable necessity, I became a Gulf war dove. Hoon's indictment of the Baghdad regime was impressive and irrefutable. But most of it had absolutely nothing to do with Saddam Hussein's threat to the west. One item on the charge sheet was a comparison between infant mortality rates in the parts of Iraq under Saddam's personal control and those outside his area of direct influence. As Hoon explained that the further a family lived from the centre of power, the greater its children's life expectancy, I realised what should have been obvious for weeks. We are being encouraged to support the war not because Saddam is a threat, but because he is evil.  Evil he undoubtedly is. But that is not in itself sufficient justification for starting a war that will kill thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of innocent civilians. If it were, God knows how many countries we would be preparing to invade. So next Tuesday, when at last we see the dossier that explains the need for a ""regime change"", we must not be satisfied with a catalogue of wickedness.  Indeed, the more that the president and the prime minister base their argument on the undoubted villainy of Saddam, the more we are entitled to believe that they cannot demonstrate, even to their own satisfaction, that he is likely to attack Israel or the west.  For next week's dossier to be intellectually convincing its claims must be judged against three criteria. Does Saddam possess, or is he likely to acquire, weapons of mass destruction? Does he possess or is he likely to acquire delivery systems, which will allow him to target America and her allies? And assuming he possesses both warheads and missiles, are there any circumstances in which it can be plausibly agreed that he would use them?  No one seriously doubts that Saddam already possesses chemical and biological weapons and that, sooner or later, he will add a primitive nuclear capability to his arsenal. And he is building, perhaps has built, some sort of rocket, as well as a crude version of the flying bomb that was used on London during the last years of the second world war. But the third question still has to be asked. Why should Saddam launch a doomed attack on the most powerful military complex that the world has ever known? I agree he is bad enough to do it. But is he sufficiently insane to set in train a course of action that can only end in his own total destruction?  The official answer to that question is that he happily gassed his own people when they defied his will, so why should we doubt his willingness to gas Americans and Israelis? On such a glorious non sequitur is the case for war constructed. Saddam knew he could get away with mass murder inside his own boundaries. Indeed, the genocide of the marsh Arabs probably made his tyranny more secure. It only needs one gas-filled warhead to land on Long Island for him and his regime to be wiped out. It does not even have to explode.  That fate cannot be avoided - as some of the more fatalistic scenarios suggest - by contracting out the dirty work. It is possible   for freelance fanatics to send envelopes of anthrax through the post and suicide bombers do not need much logistical support. But intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads can only be landed from sophisticated installations by trained technicians. If Saddam was behind it, the world would know and he would pay the price. No doubt he does give comfort and support to al-Qaida terrorists. But if America intends to invade every country that does the same, we are on the eve of another year's war.  To believe that Saddam is likely to attack the west - the only justification for war - is to believe he is a suicidal lunatic. That is an allegation that I have not heard even George Bush make against him. Indeed, the president is now barely even bothering to pretend that it is the fear of attack that prompts American action. Only two of the five requirements that he told the United Nations Saddam must meet had anything to do with the security of the United States. The other three concerned moral conduct not military capability.  For next week's dossier to make me a hawk again it will have to explain why Saddam is bent on self-destruction. Up to now nobody has even tried."

Merry Christmas","A great PM's questions. But first, a moment in British constitutional history. On Tuesday I reported that Sir Peter Tapsell, one of the last knights of the shires, had been reselected. That morning, another thunderously grand knight, Sir Patrick Cormack, announced he would not be standing again. I am told these two events are closely connected. Both men were desperate to become father of the house. But now it seems almost certain that Sir Peter (known as ""Blofeld"" on the Labour benches) will succeed. For Sir Patrick this is a devastating time, and all our thoughts are with him. He sat behind his rival, in easy backstabbing distance, but being the ultimate gentleman, Sir Patrick refused to take advantage. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and David Cameron were knocking seven bells out of each other. The Tory leader wanted to know why Britain was the only G20 country still in recession. Gordon Brown made a mistake. He said that Spain was in recession, and six other EU members were too. I assume he meant Latvia, Bulgaria, etc. This is like saying,: ""No, I am not the stupidest boy in the class. Snotty Wilson got one less than me in maths."" It is better left unsaid. He went on to say Cameron was ""talking down Britain"". This is always a sign of the end. John Major used the line in the dying days of his government. Any criticism was ""talking down Britain"". It was weedy then and it's weedy now. Cameron riposted that Brown had promised we would ""lead the world out of recession"". Brown did what he always does, and accused the Tories of having no policies. The sound in the chamber grew louder and louder as he shot: ""The voice might be that of a modern PR man, but the mindset is the 1930s!"" ""That must have sounded great in the bunker!"" snapped Cameron. Brown fought back with his trusty if rusted old sword, the Tory policy of raising the inheritance tax threshold  for, he usually adds, the rich people on Cameron's Christmas card list. This time Cameron was ready. The Labour party was the only party which had already legislated for an increase in the inheritance tax!  Brown wriggled  for him, quite deftly. He brought up the fact that the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith was a multimillionaire who paid no British tax on his offshore income. Clearly he and Cameron had dreamed up inheritance tax policy on ""the playing fields of Eton"". The battle of pre-cooked, boil-in-the-bag soundbites was getting nastier. A Labour MP raised domestic violence. The actor Reese Witherspoon had spoken about it that morning. Mr Brown paid tribute to ""Renny Wutherspoon"". Scottish readers: don't hesitate to tell me this is the way it's pronounced in east Scotland, you English bigot! Witherspoon once played the wife  of Johnny Cash. Or, as Labour MPs would sing, ""Because you're mine/I toe the line"". Finally, Sir Peter Tapsell was called. All sides gave him an immense cheer. The prime minister had said that there would soon be 300,000 troops fighting in Afghanistan, the same number as the Soviets who were humiliated there. Should the prime minister not RESIGN? (Or as Sir Peter, who has a slight speech impediment, put it, ""WESIGN!"")"
1,"During his first term as vice president of the United States, George Bush flew into London to speak at an American embassy lunch. It was a memorable occasion. During the meal itself, the noise of workmen assembling a portable podium prevented casual conversation. When the construction was complete, the vice president entertained his audience with a brief selection of his favourite platitudes. Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, wondered, sotto voce, if such large preparation had ever before produced so small a result. When the ambassador announced that the vice president was willing to answer three questions, Denis Healey cried: ""Good, I have three questions to ask."" The first concerned the moral propriety of a superpower imposing its form of government on small nations. The concept was too complicated for Bush to comprehend. So Healey made the same point in less cerebral language. ""When a man has electrodes fastened to his genitals, he is not consoled by the thought of an election in 10 year's time.""  Some of the lunch guests disapproved of Healey's descent into the harsh realities of counter-insurgency. But everyone agreed that George Bush's address had been an embarrassment. Last Friday evening, watching the Republican convention on television, it was clear to me that the genes - augmented by what George W Bush had learnt at his father's knee - were working well. There was only one fundamental difference between George Bush's embassy address and the speech with which his son accepted the Republican nomination. Dad was better.  While George Bush was adjudged a catastrophe, George W was congratulated on a triumph - even by newspapers that should be more discriminating. It goes to show that, in the 20 years which separate the two events, life has changed. These days, politicians are expected to rely on vacuous generalities, and they win applause for anodyne assurances that are calculated not to cause offence. They are no longer judged on the courage of their convictions or the relevance of their policies.  Likely winners are good. Potential losers are bad. The encomiums that George W received were not for delivery or content. He did well because he said nothing to prejudice his opinion poll lead.  That is the only explanation for the praise which has been lavished on a speech that promised ""a new beginning"", the certain winner of the Cliche of the Century Competition. And it got worse. George W believes that ""prosperity can be a tool in our hands used to build and better our country"" - a stern reproof to anyone who believes that prosperity is a disaster that good presidents avoid. He went on to promise tax cuts ""for everyone in every bracket"", an undertaking so recklessly unattainable (without a massive penalty imposed on those who rely on state spending) that even the Conservative party has abandoned it. Not even William Hague at his worst would have intoned ""The night is passing, we are awaiting for the day to dawn.""  George W Bush is offering Americans the politics of nothingness. That must be a fraudulent prospectus. For Americans have the politics of nothingness already. And it looks as if Al Gore will follow in President Clinton's tradition. I give George W credit for planning to face the great issues. But he will deal with the needs of the poor and the demands of the minorities in a way that depresses rather than improves their condition. He cannot admit that now, because to do so would sacrifice the support of enlightened America as well as the votes of the minorities themselves. All credit to the country for that. But only odium for the candidate who, fearing the decent impulse, hides behind banalities.  No sensible person could have listened to the speech that George W Bush made in Philadelphia last week without realising what a tawdry manifesto he offers. It was delivered in the monotone of a man who had arrived too late to read the text in private before the public performance. Yet the style was superior to the substance. For it represented what the ad-men regard as the apotheosis (and decent people dismiss as the nadir) of new politics. It was the clear product of focus groups and opinion polls. But it made a nod to virtue by denouncing reliance on focus groups and opinion polls.  Perhaps the demand for ""a bipartisan approach to governing"" makes more sense in American politics than it does in Britain. But the commitment to ""extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of the country"" is clearly inconsistent with the aspirations of a presidential candidate who is a hostage to big business. It all adds up to stock market politics - the endorsement of a second-rate product as long as it is likely to provide the speculators with short-term dividends.","I am absolutely certain that, sometime during last year, Norman Baker - the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes - exposed what he regarded as a political scandal and that, in consequence, he appeared on television for several consecutive days.

I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Coates's gift had no direct effect on the government's decision to allow gambling of every sort to spread like an infection through Britain. New Labour is not corrupt; its collective sin is the combination of arrogance and naivety which encourages the belief that the world is full of rich men who want to make a selfless contribution to the ""project"". When a donation is handed over, I doubt if the idea that it was written out in the hope of favours passes through the recipient's mind. But I am equally sure that the man who signed the cheque hoped for something in return.  That was certainly the case when the Tories used to complain that the trade unions were Labour's paymasters. Unions raised the political levy and used it to finance a political party which shared their aims and sometimes legislated explicitly on their behalf. That was both legitimate and laudable. Labour had been founded to support their interests and defend the welfare of their members. Even without their subventions, Labour would have initiated policies of which they approved. The party was neither bought nor sold.  There is no legitimate complaint against a vicar who accepts a large donation to his church restoration from a regular worshipper within his parish. If, on the other hand, a payment is made in recognition of the incumbent changing faith - against the wishes of his congregation - the transaction may not be financially corrupt, but it is certainly morally dubious. The payment is being made as a reward for apostasy.  The rector of Downing Street will say that his conversion is genuine - or perhaps that he never believed in the old religion and stumbled into the wrong church by mistake. That is a subject worth reasoned argument. It will not happen while cheap headlines suggest that business is bribing the government. It is not. The payments are a reward for the abandonment of socialism. The companies pay up, as the unions once did, because they think that New Labour is on their side. And, of course, they are right. When Mr Blair cooperates with Silvio Berlusconi to demand a more flexible labour market in Europe, he is making the CBI feel as warm towards him as the TUC felt towards Labour leaders when they promised to repeal the Trades Disputes Act.  Yet New Labour's alliance with industry is hardly, if ever, discussed in ideological terms. Indeed, it only breaks to the surface of most newspapers when it can - usually wholly illegitimately - be described as sleaze. There are just too many Norman Bakers about."
0,"During his first term as vice president of the United States, George Bush flew into London to speak at an American embassy lunch. It was a memorable occasion. During the meal itself, the noise of workmen assembling a portable podium prevented casual conversation. When the construction was complete, the vice president entertained his audience with a brief selection of his favourite platitudes. Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, wondered, sotto voce, if such large preparation had ever before produced so small a result. When the ambassador announced that the vice president was willing to answer three questions, Denis Healey cried: ""Good, I have three questions to ask."" The first concerned the moral propriety of a superpower imposing its form of government on small nations. The concept was too complicated for Bush to comprehend. So Healey made the same point in less cerebral language. ""When a man has electrodes fastened to his genitals, he is not consoled by the thought of an election in 10 year's time.""  Some of the lunch guests disapproved of Healey's descent into the harsh realities of counter-insurgency. But everyone agreed that George Bush's address had been an embarrassment. Last Friday evening, watching the Republican convention on television, it was clear to me that the genes - augmented by what George W Bush had learnt at his father's knee - were working well. There was only one fundamental difference between George Bush's embassy address and the speech with which his son accepted the Republican nomination. Dad was better.  While George Bush was adjudged a catastrophe, George W was congratulated on a triumph - even by newspapers that should be more discriminating. It goes to show that, in the 20 years which separate the two events, life has changed. These days, politicians are expected to rely on vacuous generalities, and they win applause for anodyne assurances that are calculated not to cause offence. They are no longer judged on the courage of their convictions or the relevance of their policies.  Likely winners are good. Potential losers are bad. The encomiums that George W received were not for delivery or content. He did well because he said nothing to prejudice his opinion poll lead.  That is the only explanation for the praise which has been lavished on a speech that promised ""a new beginning"", the certain winner of the Cliche of the Century Competition. And it got worse. George W believes that ""prosperity can be a tool in our hands used to build and better our country"" - a stern reproof to anyone who believes that prosperity is a disaster that good presidents avoid. He went on to promise tax cuts ""for everyone in every bracket"", an undertaking so recklessly unattainable (without a massive penalty imposed on those who rely on state spending) that even the Conservative party has abandoned it. Not even William Hague at his worst would have intoned ""The night is passing, we are awaiting for the day to dawn.""  George W Bush is offering Americans the politics of nothingness. That must be a fraudulent prospectus. For Americans have the politics of nothingness already. And it looks as if Al Gore will follow in President Clinton's tradition. I give George W credit for planning to face the great issues. But he will deal with the needs of the poor and the demands of the minorities in a way that depresses rather than improves their condition. He cannot admit that now, because to do so would sacrifice the support of enlightened America as well as the votes of the minorities themselves. All credit to the country for that. But only odium for the candidate who, fearing the decent impulse, hides behind banalities.  No sensible person could have listened to the speech that George W Bush made in Philadelphia last week without realising what a tawdry manifesto he offers. It was delivered in the monotone of a man who had arrived too late to read the text in private before the public performance. Yet the style was superior to the substance. For it represented what the ad-men regard as the apotheosis (and decent people dismiss as the nadir) of new politics. It was the clear product of focus groups and opinion polls. But it made a nod to virtue by denouncing reliance on focus groups and opinion polls.  Perhaps the demand for ""a bipartisan approach to governing"" makes more sense in American politics than it does in Britain. But the commitment to ""extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of the country"" is clearly inconsistent with the aspirations of a presidential candidate who is a hostage to big business. It all adds up to stock market politics - the endorsement of a second-rate product as long as it is likely to provide the speculators with short-term dividends.","A great PM's questions. But first, a moment in British constitutional history. On Tuesday I reported that Sir Peter Tapsell, one of the last knights of the shires, had been reselected. That morning, another thunderously grand knight, Sir Patrick Cormack, announced he would not be standing again. I am told these two events are closely connected. Both men were desperate to become father of the house. But now it seems almost certain that Sir Peter (known as ""Blofeld"" on the Labour benches) will succeed. For Sir Patrick this is a devastating time, and all our thoughts are with him. He sat behind his rival, in easy backstabbing distance, but being the ultimate gentleman, Sir Patrick refused to take advantage. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and David Cameron were knocking seven bells out of each other. The Tory leader wanted to know why Britain was the only G20 country still in recession. Gordon Brown made a mistake. He said that Spain was in recession, and six other EU members were too. I assume he meant Latvia, Bulgaria, etc. This is like saying,: ""No, I am not the stupidest boy in the class. Snotty Wilson got one less than me in maths."" It is better left unsaid. He went on to say Cameron was ""talking down Britain"". This is always a sign of the end. John Major used the line in the dying days of his government. Any criticism was ""talking down Britain"". It was weedy then and it's weedy now. Cameron riposted that Brown had promised we would ""lead the world out of recession"". Brown did what he always does, and accused the Tories of having no policies. The sound in the chamber grew louder and louder as he shot: ""The voice might be that of a modern PR man, but the mindset is the 1930s!"" ""That must have sounded great in the bunker!"" snapped Cameron. Brown fought back with his trusty if rusted old sword, the Tory policy of raising the inheritance tax threshold  for, he usually adds, the rich people on Cameron's Christmas card list. This time Cameron was ready. The Labour party was the only party which had already legislated for an increase in the inheritance tax!  Brown wriggled  for him, quite deftly. He brought up the fact that the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith was a multimillionaire who paid no British tax on his offshore income. Clearly he and Cameron had dreamed up inheritance tax policy on ""the playing fields of Eton"". The battle of pre-cooked, boil-in-the-bag soundbites was getting nastier. A Labour MP raised domestic violence. The actor Reese Witherspoon had spoken about it that morning. Mr Brown paid tribute to ""Renny Wutherspoon"". Scottish readers: don't hesitate to tell me this is the way it's pronounced in east Scotland, you English bigot! Witherspoon once played the wife  of Johnny Cash. Or, as Labour MPs would sing, ""Because you're mine/I toe the line"". Finally, Sir Peter Tapsell was called. All sides gave him an immense cheer. The prime minister had said that there would soon be 300,000 troops fighting in Afghanistan, the same number as the Soviets who were humiliated there. Should the prime minister not RESIGN? (Or as Sir Peter, who has a slight speech impediment, put it, ""WESIGN!"")"
1,"It was Geoffrey Hoon who converted and convinced me. Six weeks ago, in this column, I described myself as an unlikely hawk. And until last Thursday evening, a hawk of sorts I remained. For I accepted the doctrine of the pre-emptive strike - the right of a nation under threat to take early action against a potential aggressor. I still do. But when I heard the secretary of state for defence - appearing on a special edition of Question Time - give the official explanation of why military action against Baghdad might be a regrettable necessity, I became a Gulf war dove. Hoon's indictment of the Baghdad regime was impressive and irrefutable. But most of it had absolutely nothing to do with Saddam Hussein's threat to the west. One item on the charge sheet was a comparison between infant mortality rates in the parts of Iraq under Saddam's personal control and those outside his area of direct influence. As Hoon explained that the further a family lived from the centre of power, the greater its children's life expectancy, I realised what should have been obvious for weeks. We are being encouraged to support the war not because Saddam is a threat, but because he is evil.  Evil he undoubtedly is. But that is not in itself sufficient justification for starting a war that will kill thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of innocent civilians. If it were, God knows how many countries we would be preparing to invade. So next Tuesday, when at last we see the dossier that explains the need for a ""regime change"", we must not be satisfied with a catalogue of wickedness.  Indeed, the more that the president and the prime minister base their argument on the undoubted villainy of Saddam, the more we are entitled to believe that they cannot demonstrate, even to their own satisfaction, that he is likely to attack Israel or the west.  For next week's dossier to be intellectually convincing its claims must be judged against three criteria. Does Saddam possess, or is he likely to acquire, weapons of mass destruction? Does he possess or is he likely to acquire delivery systems, which will allow him to target America and her allies? And assuming he possesses both warheads and missiles, are there any circumstances in which it can be plausibly agreed that he would use them?  No one seriously doubts that Saddam already possesses chemical and biological weapons and that, sooner or later, he will add a primitive nuclear capability to his arsenal. And he is building, perhaps has built, some sort of rocket, as well as a crude version of the flying bomb that was used on London during the last years of the second world war. But the third question still has to be asked. Why should Saddam launch a doomed attack on the most powerful military complex that the world has ever known? I agree he is bad enough to do it. But is he sufficiently insane to set in train a course of action that can only end in his own total destruction?  The official answer to that question is that he happily gassed his own people when they defied his will, so why should we doubt his willingness to gas Americans and Israelis? On such a glorious non sequitur is the case for war constructed. Saddam knew he could get away with mass murder inside his own boundaries. Indeed, the genocide of the marsh Arabs probably made his tyranny more secure. It only needs one gas-filled warhead to land on Long Island for him and his regime to be wiped out. It does not even have to explode.  That fate cannot be avoided - as some of the more fatalistic scenarios suggest - by contracting out the dirty work. It is possible   for freelance fanatics to send envelopes of anthrax through the post and suicide bombers do not need much logistical support. But intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads can only be landed from sophisticated installations by trained technicians. If Saddam was behind it, the world would know and he would pay the price. No doubt he does give comfort and support to al-Qaida terrorists. But if America intends to invade every country that does the same, we are on the eve of another year's war.  To believe that Saddam is likely to attack the west - the only justification for war - is to believe he is a suicidal lunatic. That is an allegation that I have not heard even George Bush make against him. Indeed, the president is now barely even bothering to pretend that it is the fear of attack that prompts American action. Only two of the five requirements that he told the United Nations Saddam must meet had anything to do with the security of the United States. The other three concerned moral conduct not military capability.  For next week's dossier to make me a hawk again it will have to explain why Saddam is bent on self-destruction. Up to now nobody has even tried.","I am absolutely certain that, sometime during last year, Norman Baker - the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes - exposed what he regarded as a political scandal and that, in consequence, he appeared on television for several consecutive days. As I cannot recall what the so-called cause clbre concerned, I assume that it did not have a lasting effect on the life of the nation. But it certainly had an effect on Mr Baker. He developed a taste for unearthing impropriety. Last week, the Sussex Savonarola dug out details of the prime minister's Egyptian holiday. The mining metaphor is not altogether appropriate. For what Mr Baker believed to be dirt was buried in the public pages of the Register of Members' Interests. Tony Blair had, therefore, already announced that the Cairo government had paid part of the cost of the holiday in Sharm el-Sheikh and that he had made a donation of an equivalent amount to an Egyptian charity. By denouncing the arrangement as ""cheapening the office of prime minister"", Mr Baker cheapened the whole business of politics.  Politicians who are determined to say something, but have nothing of value to say, have developed the unhealthy habit of accusing their opponents of corruption, certain that - justified or not - their allegations will be reported. Last week some silly ass suggested that, because she lives in Downing Street, Cherie Blair offended against the rules of propriety by seeing her professional colleagues and clients in her own home. It is all part of the degeneration of politics from arguments about conflicting policies to claims about rival personalities.  Last week's example of that unhappy trend was the revelation - soon after the government had announced its intentions to relax the gaming laws - that the Labour party had accepted a donation of 100,000 from Peter Coates, the owner of a company called Provincial Racing. All the commentators could think of was the possibility that the gambling free-for-all was intended to repay Mr Coates's generosity. The real explanation is less sinister but equally disturbing. Indeed to me, it is rather worse than ""cash for legislation"". A corrupt government might change its ways. One which has abandoned its philosophy is more difficult to rehabilitate.

Our erstwhile ""natural party of government"" does not expect to win the next election (or, perhaps, the one after that). It's down there in the pits, snarling at the Liberal Democrats, trying to hang on to second place. Even today, through a winter of liverish complaint, it is still failing. But at least abandoning immediate hope is a start. Indeed, Iain Duncan Smith - enduring yet another TV re-relaunch with Frost yesterday - seemed to go out of his way to play Charlie Kennedy without the jokes. He talked only about ""alternative"" policies (to be formulated) and a ""strong, clear sense of direction"" (to be be discovered). His claim to credibility (pure Lib Demery) rested on the supposedly mighty achievements of Tory councils out there in the wide blue yonder, so many of them apparently that few more could be expected in May. The phrase ""when I'm prime minister..."" never crossed his dry, pursed lips.  A turning point. The Conservatives have spent almost six years pretending that Blair and New Labour are merely some brief aberration, a hiccup amid continuing hegemony. They picked William Hague because he was the obvious young pretender, the inheritor. Then they sucked their thumbs and picked Duncan Smith. Now ""desperate Tory MPs"" (according to the Daily Telegraph) are hunting round for some ""men in grey suits"" to give IDS the push. Darkness without much sight of dawn, and six wasted years.  There will doubtless be war in Iraq this year, but there will be no euro referendum. Tony Blair has his own problems. He's wasted his extra layers of popularity. But what does that mean for the Tories?  It means that, at last, they have to be serious. Ken Clarke was the only serious runner in 1997. No go: a no-no on Europe. The assumption, remember, was that somehow the Tories would be swiftly back in office, so couldn't be led by some Brussels-truckling bruiser. And 2001? The same delusion ruled in the end. Duncan Smith's main selling point (with the Telegraph, among others) was that he wasn't Ken.  Yet, with only a thin smear of hindsight, there never was going to be a referendum during Labour's first term. Gordon Brown had got his fix in. And the second term is merely a re-run in less propitious circumstances. Will a third term look any better? Not if the big majorities have begun to shrivel. Not if the Conservatives begin to look remotely electable again. Not if what we fondly remember as ""real politics"" is coming back.  Take a real politician. Kenneth Clarke, now well into his 60s, is never going to be prime minister. He won't be available in 2010. He isn't the man for the long haul. But he is still - just about - the man to rough up a government losing its confidence and way as fatigue starts to gnaw. He knows about running Treasuries and Home Offices and Health and Education. Been there, done that.  Nobody has to look at him, as they do at IDS, and wonder how he would cope. If the job is effective opposition, making up lost ground, bringing a few talented people distantly remembered back on to the front bench, then he remains the obvious choice. If they'd picked him for 2001, then Labour would already be breathing less easily - and 2005 or 2006 would look much more problematic.  But it's surely too late for any of that. Iain Duncan Smith isn't going to fall on his sword because Lord Black of Crossharbour comes calling. The ""Hague rules"" for electing a new leader are death to men in grey suits. The next election is lost and the only remaining question is: how badly? And that is where any sensible party, gradually recovering its scattered wits, would start to think hard.  The job next time is damage limitation. The essential task is seeing off the Liberal Democrats. (Not so easy if Charlie, rather bravely, turns out to have called Iraq right.) The true focus is on the future, on 2010. That may not be instant politics as we know them, a shift to some distant time frame. It may be not suit what remains of the Tory press - ludicrously hailing Bush for his billions in tax cuts and deficits.  The Conservatives won't get another new leader in midstream. They could, however, get a deputy leader, a leader in waiting for next time round. Say Oliver Letwin. They could actually start to develop policies which will have resonance during Labour's third term (when the money has gone in properly and public services are either better or worse). They could resolve their tangle over reduced taxation or increased provision with something a bit more solid than phrase-making.  They could, in short, look serious again by admitting what they seriously know in their hearts: that this is the longest haul, without quick fixes. That, compared with all the toil Neil Kinnock endured, they haven't even begun."
1,"Has the remarkable 2004 presidential election merely produced a repeat of the 2000 contest, proof that United States remains as much at war with itself in the aftermath of the second Bush election as it was after the first? Judging by the closeness of the likely electoral college figures, it may look that way. But look more carefully. Here is a big difference that really matters. In 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore than for George Bush. Yesterday, on a radically increased turnout, nearly 4 million more voted for Bush than for John Kerry.  	  Here is another difference. In 2000, Bush took Florida by only 537 votes, a margin of a mere hundredth of a percentage point. Yesterday Bush captured the sunshine state by more than 360,000 votes, a clear majority of five full points. Another decisive change.  	  And here is a third. Four years ago, it is beyond doubt that Ralph Nader, running as a third party candidate, took enough votes in Florida and elsewhere to hand the White House to Bush. Yesterday, the Nader effect faded to negligibility.  But it was a sweet night for the Republicans in other ways too. In both houses of Congress, they strengthened their narrow advantage. In the senate, where John Thune knocked off the Democratic minority leader Tom Daschle in South Dakota, Republican control is now locked in, another difference from 2000. In the House, for the sixth election in a row, the Republicans retained and strengthened their control.  	  If this doesn't add up to a mandate, it is hard to know what the word means. Increased turnout. Narrow but decisive wins on all fronts. What more can you ask for from a single campaign? Bush and his party won fair (well, probably) and square.There are no excuses this time.  We can hope that Bush takes note of the great (pro-American) English conservative Edmund Burke's dictum that ""magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom"" and governs more consensually now than before. But Bush's opponents should be wise too. Bush won. They lost. It's time for the Democrats to get back to the drawing board.  <B>","So, who won it for George Bush this time? Unlike 2000, when it took a 5-4 majority among the judges on the US supreme court to deliver the White House to the Republicans, the answer in 2004 lay firmly in the ballot box. A clear majority of all voters across the US gave Mr Bush a 51%-48% margin in the popular vote to go with his expected narrow victory in the electoral college.How was that electoral college majority made up? Once again, Mr Bush won a clear majority of states, with 28 in the bag by yesterday, compared with John Kerry's 19 (plus the District of Columbia), and three states still undecided. With only Iowa, Ohio and New Mexico still to declare, only a single state - tiny New Hampshire - had switched allegiance since 2000, voting Democrat this time instead of Republican.In the Bush era, the electoral map of the US has therefore consolidated into a great swath of ""red states"" - confusingly for Europeans the colour of the more rightwing party - stretching across the middle of the country from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, contrasted with clusters of Democratic ""blue states"" on the margins - the Pacific coast (plus Hawaii but not Alaska), the upper midwest centred on the western Great Lakes, and Mr Kerry's home region of the north-east.That picture contains a vivid reminder of several of the truths of modern presidential politics. The Republicans command rural America and have a narrow majority in the suburbs, while the Democrats are stronger in the old cities. But perhaps the most important piece of US electoral geography is in the south. Ever since the Democrats ensured that black Americans in the southern states got the right to vote in the 1960s, the south has swung ever more conclusively into the Republican camp. That pattern continued this week.Neither Al Gore in 2000 nor Mr Kerry this year managed to win a single southern state. Significantly, the only two Democrats who have won the presidency since black Americans got the vote in the south have been southern governors: Jimmy Carter of Georgia in 1976 and Bill Clinton of Arkansas in 1992 and 1996. The lesson for Democrats contemplating the task in 2008 is clear: they must have a southern strategy - or perish.But it was not just the south and the heartlands that won it for Mr Bush this week. It was also American men, and American white men in particular. Mr Bush beat Mr Kerry 54% to 45% among male voters, while Mr Kerry won almost as comfortably, 52% to 47%, among women. This confirms a striking electoral contrast between the US and western Europe, including Britain. In Europe, by and large, men vote to the left of women. In America, it is the other way round; there men vote to the right of women.  The real eye-opener, though, was Mr Bush's success among white voters, where the president captured a remarkable 61% of all white male votes (against Mr Kerry's 38%), along with 54% of white female votes (Mr Kerry trailed with 45%). No Democratic presidential candidate has captured a majority of the white electorate in the US since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Mr Kerry did no better than his several predecessors. It may be many years before it happens again. In the south, Mr Bush outpolled Mr Kerry by more than two-to-one among white Americans.Among the ethnic minorities overall, Mr Bush did much less well, though he nevertheless managed to improve his numbers. Among African Americans, he took a mere 11%, two points better than in 2000, but eclipsed by Mr Kerry's 89%. Among Latino voters, on the other hand, Mr Bush pushed his share up from 35% four years ago to 42% this time, a telling score for the future, as the disproportionately young Latino electorate expands. The president's successors will have to do even better than this to keep states like Florida, Arizona and even Mr Bush's home state of Texas from falling eventually into Democratic hands. Mr Bush took 56% of Latino votes in Florida this time, a key reason for his success in this crucial state.The generation gap showed up powerfully this week, too. First-time voters and 18-29s leaned towards Mr Kerry by 54%-44%, but expectations that a great rush of new voters (55% of whom backed Mr Kerry) would swing the election for the Democrats proved unfounded. Mr Bush meanwhile had narrow leads among early and late middle-aged voters, as well as a strong lead (58%-41%) among married voters with children. Voters aged over 60 leaned more heavily than others towards Mr Bush.Not surprisingly, richer voters were disproportionately for Mr Bush and poorer voters for his challenger. Union members leaned towards Mr Kerry by nearly two to one, but people in full-time work narrowly went for Mr Bush.  Religion's place as a key political indicator - and as a central explanation of Mr Bush's success - was also confirmed on Tuesday. Regular churchgoers voted for Mr Bush by nearly two-to-one. The president had a 13-point lead among Protestant voters, managed almost a tie with the Catholic Mr Kerry among Catholic voters, but trailed badly among traditionally Democratic Jewish voters, especially in Florida. But Mr Bush's strength among evangelical Protestants, especially strong in the south, was prodigious, with 76% of this group supporting him.Mr Bush also scored heavily over Mr Kerry among gun owners (59%-39%) and among military veterans (55%-43%). Mr Kerry, on the other hand, had a commanding lead among gay and lesbian voters (78%-21%), a much smaller group than the other two.Iraq confirmed its role as a key indicator in the 2004 contest, with 85% of those who approved the initial decision to go to war supporting Mr Bush and 87% of those who opposed it supporting Mr Kerry instead.As the opinion polls had suggested for many weeks, only a small number of voters decided who to vote for in the final week of the contest. Among those who did so, Mr Kerry had a 53%-45% advantage, rather less than poll experts would normally expect. The great majority of Americans, though - nearly 80% - say they decided who to vote for long ago. Among these, Mr Bush led by 52%-47%. The president, in other words, probably had the 2004 election in the bag all along."
0,"Has the remarkable 2004 presidential election merely produced a repeat of the 2000 contest, proof that United States remains as much at war with itself in the aftermath of the second Bush election as it was after the first? Judging by the closeness of the likely electoral college figures, it may look that way. But look more carefully. Here is a big difference that really matters. In 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore than for George Bush. Yesterday, on a radically increased turnout, nearly 4 million more voted for Bush than for John Kerry.  	  Here is another difference. In 2000, Bush took Florida by only 537 votes, a margin of a mere hundredth of a percentage point. Yesterday Bush captured the sunshine state by more than 360,000 votes, a clear majority of five full points. Another decisive change.  	  And here is a third. Four years ago, it is beyond doubt that Ralph Nader, running as a third party candidate, took enough votes in Florida and elsewhere to hand the White House to Bush. Yesterday, the Nader effect faded to negligibility.  But it was a sweet night for the Republicans in other ways too. In both houses of Congress, they strengthened their narrow advantage. In the senate, where John Thune knocked off the Democratic minority leader Tom Daschle in South Dakota, Republican control is now locked in, another difference from 2000. In the House, for the sixth election in a row, the Republicans retained and strengthened their control.  	  If this doesn't add up to a mandate, it is hard to know what the word means. Increased turnout. Narrow but decisive wins on all fronts. What more can you ask for from a single campaign? Bush and his party won fair (well, probably) and square.There are no excuses this time.  We can hope that Bush takes note of the great (pro-American) English conservative Edmund Burke's dictum that ""magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom"" and governs more consensually now than before. But Bush's opponents should be wise too. Bush won. They lost. It's time for the Democrats to get back to the drawing board.  <B>","The living are always more shocking than the dead. A seven-year-old Swedish boy tramps the streets of Phuket, searching for his parents and two brothers. A mother from the Andaman Islands weeps as she feeds her baby. The poster children of disaster and the pietas of grief are the images that cling, rather than the bodies washed ashore in a soup of debris. As the new year begins, the story of the tsunami is being shaped into a simple parable. Nature is vicious and people are kind; 150,000 corpses and 50 million in British donations alone stack up to prove a message that turns global wisdom on its head. In 2004, manmade disaster prised nations and religions apart, as dead children, from Beslan to Baghdad, supplied proof of human viciousness. Then, in a codicil to a year of terror, the planet showed that it could do apocalypse and primal fear better than any mortal agent.  So goodbye cosmic solitude, banished in a tragedy that united rich tourists with the 'sea gypsies' of poor Muslim communities, eking out such a threadbare existence on the shoreline of paradise that the tidal wave bore no economic sting to the countries it devastated. The tsunami's damage to India, for example, is likely to amount to only 0.07 per cent of its gross domestic product.  Anguish is not often universal. Susan Sontag, the American writer who died of leukaemia last week, argued that victims guarded their sorrows jealously. 'It is intolerable to have one's own sufferings twinned with anyone else's,' she wrote. Not any more, as newspaper elegists focus on victims from Surrey to Sumatra and the world huddles round its shared catastrophe.  The vast sums collected reflect, beyond altruism, a hope that the wildness of nature and the folly of men can be bought off in corporate donations and pensioners' heating allowances. Individuals' generosity, though praiseworthy and humbling, suggests something more complicated than kindness.  Hideous and dramatic scenes instil to help, but they also catalyse an adrenaline of mourning. That mood does not necessarily promise a better tomorrow. The solidarity following 9/11 fractured into revenge that ushered in a more perilous world and bystanders inured to the pain of others. In contrast to the audit of tragedy after the tsunami, no government bothered to count the bodies of Iraqi civilians.  Collective emotion is always fickle and sometimes tainted. In one of the last great outbreaks of group grieving, cellophane-wrapped bouquets piled up for Princess Diana, and the media clamoured for leadership. Just as the Queen was bidden back from Balmoral, so Tony Blair was urged to get off his Egyptian deckchair and fly home. The mawkish wake for Diana is not to be compared with the heartfelt response of people who could understand, in the tsunami victims' agony, how it must feel to watch a partner drown, to cry in vain for a lost child or to lament the disappeared.  But both real and synthetic grief slide easily into blame. Scapegoats of the tsunami range from organised religion to shambolic aid providers to moneyed Westerners with an unhealthy yen for beachside primitivism. For blamers and the givers to draw what sense and solace they can from horror is not a disreputable response.  It is not an endorsement of William Hazlitt's view that love of cruelty is as natural as sympathy to human beings, let alone of Edmund Burke's belief that we have 'a degree of delight' in the pain of strangers. Modern citizens, sated by images of death, do not need a tsunami to teach them how randomly the bell tolls.  But disaster also offers a strange comfort. The solidarity of giving assuages the guilt and fractiousness of societies normally force-fed on fear and mistrust. It also lulls people into using the unthinkable as an affirmation of their own worldviews, rather than the challenge it should be.  Secularists deride the platitudes of churchmen and ask how the religious can believe in a god who sanctions such atrocities. The devout criticise the nihilism of rationalists and describe their own faith as a candle in the darkness. Creationists, who still think that 'the fountains of the great deep' in Genesis 7.11 signified the tsunami that launched Noah and his floating zoo, presumably consider the latest earthquake another instalment in the Almighty's great partwork.  Those who consider global warming an overrated fuss see the earthquake as proof that outlawing aerosols and recycling the new year champagne bottles are pointless gestures. More plausibly, people who warn that the world is on a reckless path to self-destruction decipher in the earthquake an urgent warning of what is happening to a planet cursed by hurricanes, typhoons and rising seas.  The tsunami has confirmed, and never confounded, the views of its spectators. An earthquake may tilt the world on its axis, but it cannot shake the human mind. President Bush, whose initial pledge of $15m was half the cost of his inauguration, will still not sign up to Kyoto. Mr Blair writes boldly in the Economist of 'aiming high' on climate change during the presidency of the G8, but many worry that his market-based approach to climate change and lack of curbs on lavish energy consumers smack of pitching his efforts far too low.  Ordinary citizens, even the most generous, need to notice the 30,000 children under five who die each day, irrespective of whether their corpses lie alongside those of Western babies. The godless, like me, should never presume to see catastrophe as a snub to people of faith, just as all believers should acknowledge that their god is supremely short of answers when worlds cave in and children rot to death in hospital corridors.  The donations will be counted, the aid will kick in and the monolith of the UN will creak into action, for a time. New earthquake monitors will ensure that no crab can scuttle across the floor of the Indian Ocean without activating a sensor in Jakarta or Bangkok.  But nothing will really change unless the spirit of global co-operation is real. That means confronting the overlapping problems of climate change, humanitarian crises and war. It means never again embarking so recklessly on the sort of manufactured catastrophe still unrolling in Iraq. It means realising that a volatile planet and uniquely powerful warmongers form a mix no species can reliably withstand.  The tsunami offers many lessons, but one is the selectivity of pity. A Swedish boy searches for his parents. A mother from a vanishing tribe gazes across her infant's body through a wall of tears, and the world responds to both. But the test of compassion is what happens next to millions of people made hungry and poor by acts of nature and global policy alike.  In the optimistic view, people have signalled a universal empathy not just with last week's survivors but with the legions of shadowy victims marginalised, demonised or massacred at the whim of the mighty. Citizens have distilled the essence of reform. It is up to politicians to bottle and sell it."
1,"So, who won it for George Bush this time? Unlike 2000, when it took a 5-4 majority among the judges on the US supreme court to deliver the White House to the Republicans, the answer in 2004 lay firmly in the ballot box. A clear majority of all voters across the US gave Mr Bush a 51%-48% margin in the popular vote to go with his expected narrow victory in the electoral college.How was that electoral college majority made up? Once again, Mr Bush won a clear majority of states, with 28 in the bag by yesterday, compared with John Kerry's 19 (plus the District of Columbia), and three states still undecided. With only Iowa, Ohio and New Mexico still to declare, only a single state - tiny New Hampshire - had switched allegiance since 2000, voting Democrat this time instead of Republican.In the Bush era, the electoral map of the US has therefore consolidated into a great swath of ""red states"" - confusingly for Europeans the colour of the more rightwing party - stretching across the middle of the country from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, contrasted with clusters of Democratic ""blue states"" on the margins - the Pacific coast (plus Hawaii but not Alaska), the upper midwest centred on the western Great Lakes, and Mr Kerry's home region of the north-east.That picture contains a vivid reminder of several of the truths of modern presidential politics. The Republicans command rural America and have a narrow majority in the suburbs, while the Democrats are stronger in the old cities. But perhaps the most important piece of US electoral geography is in the south. Ever since the Democrats ensured that black Americans in the southern states got the right to vote in the 1960s, the south has swung ever more conclusively into the Republican camp. That pattern continued this week.Neither Al Gore in 2000 nor Mr Kerry this year managed to win a single southern state. Significantly, the only two Democrats who have won the presidency since black Americans got the vote in the south have been southern governors: Jimmy Carter of Georgia in 1976 and Bill Clinton of Arkansas in 1992 and 1996. The lesson for Democrats contemplating the task in 2008 is clear: they must have a southern strategy - or perish.But it was not just the south and the heartlands that won it for Mr Bush this week. It was also American men, and American white men in particular. Mr Bush beat Mr Kerry 54% to 45% among male voters, while Mr Kerry won almost as comfortably, 52% to 47%, among women. This confirms a striking electoral contrast between the US and western Europe, including Britain. In Europe, by and large, men vote to the left of women. In America, it is the other way round; there men vote to the right of women.  The real eye-opener, though, was Mr Bush's success among white voters, where the president captured a remarkable 61% of all white male votes (against Mr Kerry's 38%), along with 54% of white female votes (Mr Kerry trailed with 45%). No Democratic presidential candidate has captured a majority of the white electorate in the US since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Mr Kerry did no better than his several predecessors. It may be many years before it happens again. In the south, Mr Bush outpolled Mr Kerry by more than two-to-one among white Americans.Among the ethnic minorities overall, Mr Bush did much less well, though he nevertheless managed to improve his numbers. Among African Americans, he took a mere 11%, two points better than in 2000, but eclipsed by Mr Kerry's 89%. Among Latino voters, on the other hand, Mr Bush pushed his share up from 35% four years ago to 42% this time, a telling score for the future, as the disproportionately young Latino electorate expands. The president's successors will have to do even better than this to keep states like Florida, Arizona and even Mr Bush's home state of Texas from falling eventually into Democratic hands. Mr Bush took 56% of Latino votes in Florida this time, a key reason for his success in this crucial state.The generation gap showed up powerfully this week, too. First-time voters and 18-29s leaned towards Mr Kerry by 54%-44%, but expectations that a great rush of new voters (55% of whom backed Mr Kerry) would swing the election for the Democrats proved unfounded. Mr Bush meanwhile had narrow leads among early and late middle-aged voters, as well as a strong lead (58%-41%) among married voters with children. Voters aged over 60 leaned more heavily than others towards Mr Bush.Not surprisingly, richer voters were disproportionately for Mr Bush and poorer voters for his challenger.

Even the most sober reader, though, may have difficulty calling to mind the present US ambassador's name. The explanation is simple, however. There isn't one. America has not had an ambassador here for five months. Not that, in recent years, you would have been much the wiser if there had been. Britain may be Washington's most devoted ally, and the London posting may be one of the most prestigious in the American foreign service, but the last US ambassador in London, William Farish, was so low profile that most people here were unaware of his presence or his departure.  Ambassador Farish was not the first envoy to get his job for services rendered - he was for years the Bush family's private banker - and he will doubtless not be the last. But the point was not that he was a political appointment rather than a career diplomat. It was that he was the original silent envoy, and his anonymity - save in bloodstock circles - came at a heavy political price.  It meant that, throughout one of the most demanding periods of modern transatlantic relations, America lacked a strong voice and presence on this side of the water. This was a double deprivation. It was a loss to Britain, since it left Tony Blair to take all the hits while attempting to mediate US policy in this country. And it was a loss to the US, because there was no one with the clout to mediate Britain's views back to the American administration and people.  You could argue, as some do, that in the networked world of the 21st century, ambassadors are not as important as they once were. And you would be right. Obviously when Blair and George Bush can do a video conference any time they choose, then the once decisive role of the ambassador is clearly diminished.  But this is also to underestimate the role, especially in the modern media world. An accomplished communicator, constantly absorbing and sensitive to a foreign country's mood on a daily basis, is an immense proactive asset for any nation. At its best, it means being able to participate in and influence opinion - having someone to go on the Today programme in the morning, to respond to the newspapers during the day, and to go on Newsnight at the end of the evening.  Above all, though, it means being a nation's dialoguer-in-chief, putting the case not just with the politicians but with the people. Britain's most recent ambassadors in Washington - Christopher Meyer and David Manning - have both been good at this. Many London embassies, including the French and the German, currently have ambassadors who can do it too.  But the Americans, infinitely more important, don't. That absence leaves a vacuum. Ambassador Farish's invisibility meant that most of the British public got its take on American policy from news footage of Bush and Donald Rumsfeld speaking in American ways to American audiences. Or else, since our broadcasters like attention-seekers, they got it hyped up by ideological provocateurs such as Richard Perle or Frank Gaffney.  What explains this deliberate absence from public debate? Is this because American diplomats are now so sealed off that they just don't get it? Or that they have calculated that it is simply not worth the aggravation? Or is it, as one reading of Condoleezza Rice's move to the state department has it, that the Rhett Butler view of the world - ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" - now rules across Washington, from Pennsylvania Avenue to Foggy Bottom?  Whatever the explanation, America is wrong not to have a more positive strategy for dialogue with the peoples of other nations, a strategy in which embassies would be bound to play a crucial part. Whatever conclusion one draws about the Iraq war has to include the fact that it constituted an overall failure of US diplomacy. Put the blame where you choose - with America and its allies or with America's opponents, or share it round - but the failure is unresolved business. You only have to look at opinion polls round the world to see that. Anti-Americanism has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished. But this will not happen without working at it.  There are very few signs anywhere in Europe that Bush's re-election is encouraging an outbreak of pragmatism. Perhaps in Germany, and to some extent in Spain. But not in France, and not in this country either. The readiness of some, happily only a few, to talk down the democratic revolution in Ukraine because it is supported by the US is ultimately more of a problem for those who think this way than for anyone else. But it is indicative of the poisonous nature of the wider problem facing the US, and that poison ought to be drawn.  So we should welcome two recent signs that the American embassy here is beginning to be concerned about the tone of some of the allegations levelled against its country. On November 26, as Naomi Klein described on these pages last Saturday, the London embassy indignantly challenged her claim that the US was fighting a war directed at Iraqi civilians and was ""eliminating"" witnesses of its policy, notably journalists, doctors and clerics. The same week, David T Johnson, the US charge d'affaires in London, wrote a letter published here on November 27 defending American support for democracy in Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern Europe in the face of an article headlined ""US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev"".  Both these responses were overdue in their own right. The one to Klein over Iraq was necessary because of the exceptional seriousness of the charges she is making, while that on Ukraine was a politically important rebuttal of the ""my enemy's enemy is my friend"" syndrome that has eaten into some anti-American responses to the scenes in Kiev. But the embassy's engagement is also something else: a recognition that the state department believes things have gone too far. Not before time, some might say.  It would be naive to say that the administration's foreign policy problems will be solved merely by international dialogue, still more to imply that the appointment of a top communicator to head each of the US's major embassies would achieve that goal. But these problems will certainly not be resolved without dialogue and better communicators. And unless the US raises its game, it will simply allow others to make the running. A new US ambassador prepared to make Washington's case not just articulately but also respectfully and sensitively would be good for America. But it would be good for Britain, too."

If you were to come down from space, I mean, and read the papers. Not if you were actually on a protest march.All regular marches against all regular evils are populated by extremely pretty 18-year-old women. The template for this was the Paris student riots of 1968. ""Never mind the issues,"" said we English. ""Why can't we have one of those very attractive blond ladies, waving flags? Why do we always have to have beardy trade unionists?"" However, innovators pointed out that we, too, could have young women at demonstrations - all we needed to do was concentrate, like we do when the A-level results come out. See that group of young men, with spots, punching the air, making you feel ashamed for your nation, nay, species? Ignore them. Ignore the fat ones, who are crying. Happy... young... yes, you're almost there... female. Bingo. If you were to come down from space, you could be forgiven for thinking that men weren't allowed to take A-levels at all; they took some kind of BTEC, the results of which came out on Christmas Day and sadly couldn't be published.Anyway, there are, of course, some exceptions to the Pretty Protester rule. Protesters against war, environmental issues, poll tax, these will all be pretty - even publications that are fervently in favour of poll tax will concede there are some very pretty women around and it would be a shame not to take pictures of them. Countryside Alliance marches, as represented in the leftwing press, will, again, involve some very pretty people. In the rightwing press, however, they will mainly be populated by families. These are proper people, with proper sperm, put to proper use. Anarchist protesters, however, are not ladies. They are aggressive young men. Rationale: these marches were not cleared with the police; attractive people do not break the law; ergo, there were no attractive people at this protest. Either that, or the coloured mohican hairstyles were so special it seemed a shame to overshadow them with blondness.Likewise, on a march where the majority are Muslims, there won't be any pretty ones. If there are pretty ones, they will have snuck in, under an umbrella of shouting people. And really, I can't make up my mind which is less respectful - the pretty approach, which is really a means of saying, ""We don't need to worry about these people, they are just young, with high spirits,"" or the non-pretty approach, which is a way of saying, ""Do worry about these people; they may also be young, but they mean you no good.""Ideally, of course, the pictures chosen to represent a march should be of a sensible, not particularly attractive person, of a sensible, not particularly young age, chanting a sensible chant, not disfigured by hate and rage. Someone like me. Only take pictures of me. I'm always there. I'll be near the back."

Above all, though, it means being a nation's dialoguer-in-chief, putting the case not just with the politicians but with the people. Britain's most recent ambassadors in Washington - Christopher Meyer and David Manning - have both been good at this. Many London embassies, including the French and the German, currently have ambassadors who can do it too.  But the Americans, infinitely more important, don't. That absence leaves a vacuum. Ambassador Farish's invisibility meant that most of the British public got its take on American policy from news footage of Bush and Donald Rumsfeld speaking in American ways to American audiences. Or else, since our broadcasters like attention-seekers, they got it hyped up by ideological provocateurs such as Richard Perle or Frank Gaffney.  What explains this deliberate absence from public debate? Is this because American diplomats are now so sealed off that they just don't get it? Or that they have calculated that it is simply not worth the aggravation? Or is it, as one reading of Condoleezza Rice's move to the state department has it, that the Rhett Butler view of the world - ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" - now rules across Washington, from Pennsylvania Avenue to Foggy Bottom?  Whatever the explanation, America is wrong not to have a more positive strategy for dialogue with the peoples of other nations, a strategy in which embassies would be bound to play a crucial part. Whatever conclusion one draws about the Iraq war has to include the fact that it constituted an overall failure of US diplomacy. Put the blame where you choose - with America and its allies or with America's opponents, or share it round - but the failure is unresolved business. You only have to look at opinion polls round the world to see that. Anti-Americanism has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished. But this will not happen without working at it.  There are very few signs anywhere in Europe that Bush's re-election is encouraging an outbreak of pragmatism. Perhaps in Germany, and to some extent in Spain. But not in France, and not in this country either. The readiness of some, happily only a few, to talk down the democratic revolution in Ukraine because it is supported by the US is ultimately more of a problem for those who think this way than for anyone else. But it is indicative of the poisonous nature of the wider problem facing the US, and that poison ought to be drawn.  So we should welcome two recent signs that the American embassy here is beginning to be concerned about the tone of some of the allegations levelled against its country. On November 26, as Naomi Klein described on these pages last Saturday, the London embassy indignantly challenged her claim that the US was fighting a war directed at Iraqi civilians and was ""eliminating"" witnesses of its policy, notably journalists, doctors and clerics. The same week, David T Johnson, the US charge d'affaires in London, wrote a letter published here on November 27 defending American support for democracy in Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern Europe in the face of an article headlined ""US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev"".  Both these responses were overdue in their own right. The one to Klein over Iraq was necessary because of the exceptional seriousness of the charges she is making, while that on Ukraine was a politically important rebuttal of the ""my enemy's enemy is my friend"" syndrome that has eaten into some anti-American responses to the scenes in Kiev. But the embassy's engagement is also something else: a recognition that the state department believes things have gone too far. Not before time, some might say.  It would be naive to say that the administration's foreign policy problems will be solved merely by international dialogue, still more to imply that the appointment of a top communicator to head each of the US's major embassies would achieve that goal. But these problems will certainly not be resolved without dialogue and better communicators. And unless the US raises its game, it will simply allow others to make the running. A new US ambassador prepared to make Washington's case not just articulately but also respectfully and sensitively would be good for America. But it would be good for Britain, too.","Has the remarkable 2004 presidential election merely produced a repeat of the 2000 contest, proof that United States remains as much at war with itself in the aftermath of the second Bush election as it was after the first? Judging by the closeness of the likely electoral college figures, it may look that way. But look more carefully. Here is a big difference that really matters. In 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore than for George Bush. Yesterday, on a radically increased turnout, nearly 4 million more voted for Bush than for John Kerry.  	  Here is another difference. In 2000, Bush took Florida by only 537 votes, a margin of a mere hundredth of a percentage point. Yesterday Bush captured the sunshine state by more than 360,000 votes, a clear majority of five full points. Another decisive change.  	  And here is a third. Four years ago, it is beyond doubt that Ralph Nader, running as a third party candidate, took enough votes in Florida and elsewhere to hand the White House to Bush. Yesterday, the Nader effect faded to negligibility.  But it was a sweet night for the Republicans in other ways too. In both houses of Congress, they strengthened their narrow advantage. In the senate, where John Thune knocked off the Democratic minority leader Tom Daschle in South Dakota, Republican control is now locked in, another difference from 2000. In the House, for the sixth election in a row, the Republicans retained and strengthened their control.  	  If this doesn't add up to a mandate, it is hard to know what the word means. Increased turnout. Narrow but decisive wins on all fronts. What more can you ask for from a single campaign? Bush and his party won fair (well, probably) and square.There are no excuses this time.  We can hope that Bush takes note of the great (pro-American) English conservative Edmund Burke's dictum that ""magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom"" and governs more consensually now than before. But Bush's opponents should be wise too. Bush won. They lost. It's time for the Democrats to get back to the drawing board.  <B>"
0,"There used to be a game at particularly drunken 1930s house parties - I must have read this in PG Wodehouse - in which one person would leave the room and the remaining guests then tried to remember who it was. Even the most sober reader, though, may have difficulty calling to mind the present US ambassador's name. The explanation is simple, however. There isn't one. America has not had an ambassador here for five months. Not that, in recent years, you would have been much the wiser if there had been. Britain may be Washington's most devoted ally, and the London posting may be one of the most prestigious in the American foreign service, but the last US ambassador in London, William Farish, was so low profile that most people here were unaware of his presence or his departure.  Ambassador Farish was not the first envoy to get his job for services rendered - he was for years the Bush family's private banker - and he will doubtless not be the last. But the point was not that he was a political appointment rather than a career diplomat. It was that he was the original silent envoy, and his anonymity - save in bloodstock circles - came at a heavy political price.  It meant that, throughout one of the most demanding periods of modern transatlantic relations, America lacked a strong voice and presence on this side of the water. This was a double deprivation. It was a loss to Britain, since it left Tony Blair to take all the hits while attempting to mediate US policy in this country. And it was a loss to the US, because there was no one with the clout to mediate Britain's views back to the American administration and people.  You could argue, as some do, that in the networked world of the 21st century, ambassadors are not as important as they once were. And you would be right. Obviously when Blair and George Bush can do a video conference any time they choose, then the once decisive role of the ambassador is clearly diminished.  But this is also to underestimate the role, especially in the modern media world. An accomplished communicator, constantly absorbing and sensitive to a foreign country's mood on a daily basis, is an immense proactive asset for any nation.

It's something the media need to avoid playing their unwatchful part in, but it's part of what political persuasion is about. The invention of consent is another matter. It's the modern byproduct of a politics that turns people off. It's therefore likely to be especially alluring to a government that managed to induce only 59% of the voters to turn out at the last election. So we are discovering now. The single most contentious element of the Blair-Blunkett law reform programme is being prepared with the invention of consent. The appointed inventor is Michael Wills MP, junior minister to the lord chancellor. His Saturday letter to the Guardian, replying to a leader, let us into his workshop. Curtailing the right to trial by jury, he wrote, would be subject to the full panoply of consultation. But this was not the point. The change was already a done deal with the people. ""I am surprised you ignore the manifesto on which this government was elected last June,"" he declared, from a substantial height. ""The people considered that manifesto and voted for it."" There was hardly any more to be said.  Seldom has the doctrine of the mandate been more starkly, or more absurdly, put. First, it seems to overlook the problem of scale. When governments got in with 50 or even 40% support, as they did at times in the last century, the mandate might have been   a plausible construct of what could be called the general will. The Blair government got the votes of 23% of the electorate. Was this proof of anything in detail, except a level of reluctant approval exceeding that accorded the other parties?  Second, it must be doubted how many of the few people who, as research always tells us, ""considered that manifesto"" read the section on trial by jury. Their omission would be forgivable. The subject was never mentioned in any speech by anyone in the Labour leadership. It had no priority. It did not feature in the party broadcasts. It could not have been in even the remoter minds of many, if any, of the 10m voters who gave Blair a second term.  That is because of a third factor, namely the absence from this famous, legitimising, solemnly examined manifesto of any explicit promise to abolish the right to jury trial. There were no speeches on the subject partly because the words of the manifesto were crafted to avoid the provocation that might require them. It promised to ""remove the widely abused right of defendants alone to dictate whether or not they should be tried in a crown court"": words that only aficionados of courts were meant to understand as promising the widespread curtailment of jury trial.  What we have, in short, is the opposite of the Wills version of the truth. Instead of majority consent being demonstrably given by the classic democratic method, an attenuated minority were   deprived of such opportunity as they might have had to object to a proposal whose purpose was carefully masked in gobbledegook. Far from the voters having agreed to abolish some jury trials, even the small number who read the manifesto were not confronted with the meaning of what the next Labour government intended to do.   If they had been, no doubt Labour would still have won. But this only adds to the corruption of the mandate theory as Wills and his masters are applying it to trial by jury. What they claim to have got approved, they dishonestly concealed. Now they're relying on it as protection against the thinness of their substantive arguments: their dissembling about the quality of justice that will result: their pretence that the change has nothing to do either with getting more convictions or with saving money: the abject sophistry with which Mr Wills proposes that, because 95% of all crime is tried by magistrates, jumping that up to 98% (why not 100?) should cause us not the slightest apprehension.  The plan grows out of a recommendation by Lord Justice Auld, whose inquiry into the trial process was always   likely to be hot politics in an election year. He adroitly deflected blatant attempts to nobble him, or leak a few cherry-picked ideas. Telephoned one day by a Downing Street official probing to find out where his report was heading, Auld apparently asked Mr Blair's man to put his questions on paper. The official, recoiling in horror, proposed just a casual, always deniable conversation. Fine, said the judge - but wait a moment while I get my shorthand writer.  The probe was quickly abandoned. But abolition of the right to trial by jury turned out to be one of Auld's central recommendations, and one most pleasing to ministers. The right, he proposed, should no longer be available across the range of medium-level cases carrying prison sentences of up to two years, where defendants can now choose whether to go before magistrates or a jury.  Under the rules laid out by Auld, some experts have estimated, this could halve the 50,000 jury trials that take place every year. Internal Home Office papers, picked up in a pub and never formally repudiated, show one official even estimating a two thirds reduction. So this is not a minor re-drawing of the frontiers, as Wills implies. It's an attack on the historic right - one of the most celebrated and worthwhile instruments of British democratic freedom - of perhaps half those accused of serious crimes to be tried by a jury of their peers.  Governments have dreamed of doing this for at least a   decade. The last time it was subjected to rational discussion, when Jack Straw was home secretary, the legislature threw it out. Straw brought it forward twice, in different forms, and each time the House of Lords rejected the new mode of trial he proposed. Each time, the bill fell essentially because of outrage at what could easily lapse into class-based justice.  Shoplifting might attract a small sentence, but for first-time offenders would ruin their reputation, which meant their right to a jury must be inviolate. On the other hand, if that right existed for a white professional, why should it be withdrawn from a black street robber with a record? Such were the dilemmas the Lords thought irresolvable by any bureaucratic system that transferred the decision from the defendant to the magistrates or the district judge.  The arguments have not changed. Auld has not demolished them. It's a matter, in the end, of moral choice. Wills' invention of popular consent is a way of not engaging with the assault the government wants to make on a cornerstone of liberty. It is saying to the House of Lords: do not dare, once again, to defy the will of the people. But the clearer message of this history is to Labour MPs in the House of Commons: you did not get elected to abolish the right to trial by jury, and therefore have no duty to be whipped into abandoning the belief many of you hold, that it would be indefensible."
1,"Another day, another front page NHS horror story. London's billboards were ablaze this week with an evening paper tale - ""94-year-old abandoned in casualty"". It was a good blood-boiler - a frail old lady who had fallen and concussed herself was left alone ""caked in blood"" and forgotten for three days in A and E for lack of a hospital bed. Except it wasn't true. There were beds, but she was kept under observation, moved to a room of her own and only sent to a ward when well enough. But despite the hospital's vigorous denials the story still appeared, repeated in the Daily Mail, deeply implanting in a million minds yet another nasty NHS snapshot.  The NHS is in grave danger - not from internal failure but from external attack. A war of anecdotes has replaced most attempts at careful analysis. It is more fun to write ""My hospital hell"", or ""My hospital heaven in a much better Spanish hospital"", ""My wonderful NHS birth experience"", or ""My neighbour's 10-hour wait for his son's cut finger"". Journalists who do not usually write about health feel quite at liberty to expound their own sudden brushes with medicine, good and bad, as if this were ""evidence"" of the state of the NHS, taking leave of the objective analysis they would apply to other subjects. Since I write about health, I am bombarded with friends' and colleagues' NHS sagas - good and bad - as if these were triumphant ""proof"" of anything. A head of a TV news service told me the   other day that he now ""knew"" the NHS could not survive: his wife had a bad NHS birth. Actually it was because the hospital at the time was undergoing a major maternity ward renovation, one of more than 200 around the country, costing 100m. To be sure the temporary decanting process had been abominably managed, but this was not the sign he took it to be that now we must reach for some radical privatising alternative.   Health stories are dynamite. Inordinate gleeful space and TV time is given to any medical calamity - last week's corker happened to come from a private hospital where a young mother died. As the NHS treats a million people a day, there will never be a shortage of such tales, as indeed, there never is in ""better"" Europe where just such horror stories of killer surgeons or fatal injections fill their tabloid pages too. In TV news rooms I see how pushy health correspondents, competing to get their faces on screen, can always elbow their way into the running order with some souped-up NHS crisis. Only 100% perfect medicine will do now, with zero mistakes and zero below-average treatment (a statistical impossibility). Without statistics, any bad anecdote lets the press ring the death knell for a non-viable, non-survivable health service.   No such excited attention greeted the first annual report of the NHS modernisation board, the body which oversees the government's 10-year plan, on which sit leaders of the royal colleges of doctors and nurses, trade unions, managers and the independent Kings Fund. Barely reported, (not at all in most papers), here is the first annual assessment of what is actually happening. This is no New Labour spin machine, for on this board sit those who shout loudest when things get bad: they have no vested interest in glossing the facts, especially as many are in the middle of tricky NHS contract negotiations.   Their report charts progress so far, not startling, but progress: 597 new critical care beds, 714 new general beds, 500 more secure mental beds, 10,000 more nurses, four new medical schools to double doctors in training, 10 new major hospitals, free nursing care for people in nursing homes, 150 new rapid access chest pain clinics, 797 GPs surgeries modernised, 42 new high street walk-in health centres, 5.75m patients using the new NHS Direct telephone advice service, and more. But some of the ""successes"" only serve to remind us how far there is still to go: 60% of GP surgeries now see patients within 48 hours, (hardly a triumph). The number of people waiting more than 15 months for their operation fell by a third but was still 8,100 (to be eliminated by 2005). Meanwhile, seven out of 10 were treated within three months. It is not much of a boast that no hospital now has ""red"" alert status for dirt, while more are still ""yellow"" than top class ""green"" clean. But the money is at last flowing in - 21 new MRI scanners, 52 CT scanners and so on.   For all that, the killer anecdote will always win. Meanwhile consider the absence of some old stories. Leading NHS figures, like Lord Winston, are no longer blowing the whistle, as they rightly did on Labour's disastrous first two low-spending years. So far, for the second year running there has been no winter beds crisis. The NHS dog is no longer barking, even if it is too early to start wagging its tail.   However good the NHS may become, the front pages of the 75% Conservative press will still proclaim it is getting worse. Tory hopes are pinned on persuading voters this failed ""Stalinist"" institution can only be saved by a dose of privatisation. As a tactic it works: Labour did the same with its own outrageous ""24 hours to save the NHS"" slogan at the 1997 election. It is lethal for public trust in the NHS, but all politicians kick it about recklessly for their own self-interest. The recent Telegraph poll showed how voters are swayed: two thirds think the NHS is in bad shape. Yet asked about their personal experience, 86% are happy with their GP and 77% happy with their hospital treatment. What can the NHS do when people believe the Daily Mail more than the evidence of their own lives?   The answer has to come from within the NHS itself. Those doctors and nurses who speak out in bad times must get used to the idea of publicly defending it in good times against its predators. Tory ideas are flowing fast: Iain Duncan Smith posits getting people to pay to visit GPs. Professor Tim Congdon, Tory economic guru, this week publishes a pamphlet calling for state spending to shrink from 40% to 25% of GDP, cutting public services to a rump with minimal vouchers for health and education to be cashed in private facilities. ""Over time extra expenditure would have to be financed by parents, patients and citizens, as they saw fit."" It is not just the usual Tory extremists who now play around with the idea that the NHS is beyond repair, a 1940s outfit unfit for the 21st century and the like.   The prime minister and Alan Milburn deserve their own share of the blame. It is time to stop floating a clever new NHS wheeze every week. It is time they started to stand up for the basic principles of the NHS, proclaiming its growing strength and encouraging its staff. Nuts and bolts reforms being implemented by the modernisation board are bearing fruit. The more Labour talks up radical ideas using the word ""private"", the more they undermine trust and confirm the Tory story that an ideological revolution is required: their own facts and figures suggest otherwise.","The ID-cards vote passed: however angry Labour MPs are at this succession of pointless provocations inflicted on them, there is sensible a limit to how much damage they will inflict on themselves. Plenty of them have much to fear in their own constituencies in this low season for Labour.Those who did spend a freezing wet weekend in Blackpool found the spring conference pretty dismal and dispiriting. It was planned as a rip-roaring celebration of Labour's glorious centenary, but few people came; there were few MPs, a smattering of ministers drafted in, and the press room was bare. Many constituency parties sent no delegates.The frail state of the grassroots was whispered often in the Winter Gardens. Hazel Blears and John Prescott, trying to bounce the party into a semblance of life with defibrillator jolts of demented optimism, rashly opined that parties which wither at the roots will die at the top. With most big cities lost and a massacre of remaining councils expected at the May elections, some constituency parties that have recently lost their MP, their council and most councillors are struggling to sustain the will to live. Now add in the Dunfermline result and it's not surprising that so few went to Blackpool. As the leadership interregnum drags on, it saps the blood of the party.Tony Blair turned in a below-par speech. But even belowpar and fading in power to convince, every time he steps up to a lectern he reminds them all of his political genius. It is the same in the Commons: he stands amid swelling backbench rebellion, yet on Wednesday mornings he can rouse his party to whooping glee as he lands punches on the bench opposite, reminding his own that they may miss him when he's gone. With all that vim and verve, no wonder he can't let go. So much still to do, so much to stop his successor doing.It is human instinct to clutch after immortality, leaving a footstep in the shifting sand. But political leaders crave it with unnatural passion. Blair is trying to force his legacy on to his successor, fixing Gordon Brown's feet in concrete into his own footsteps. The so-called ""dual prime minister"" scenario described by Charles Clarke looks more like the grizzly embrace of death, the dying man holding the future leader in a deadly grip with his last gasp.In this terminal phase, Brown has no option but to obey. So out he goes to bat for the ID cards he used to think wildly too expensive. In his speech yesterday on security, he even made a reasonable stab at pretending a pressing need for the ""glorification of terrorism"" clause, which virtually no one in the Commons believes. His speeches are taking a Churchillian turn as he reprises his Britishness theme, calling for ceremonies in every constituency for Veterans' Day and new cadet schemes to instil military discipline in state-school pupils. ""We will not yield, relax, rest, become complacent or lower our guard but will use every means, every necessary resource..."" and more, to fight terror.The daily taunts from the Tories (and some Blairites) that Brown will abandon ""reform"" to lead Labour back to its dark days of producer interests and union power seem to be hitting their mark. In response, no flag is big enough, no trumpet loud enough, no dead hero's memorial tall enough - Brown must add to their patriotic clamour.It may not gladden the hearts of those hoping that his premiership will herald renewal, optimism and progressive enthusiasm. Every time Brown parrots the need for ""reform, reform, reform"" as defined by Blair, spirits in the party sink a bit lower. But he has no choice. He is destined to follow Blair's footsteps every inch of the way - until the old leader finally departs and discovers that no prime minister can ever command the future beyond his time.All this tells us very little of what to expect when Brown's day finally comes. Expect no more than a tiny flash of the cardinal's red lining in what he says now. Whether once in power he will ever give more than the odd tantalising glimpse, it's hard to know. But for now he has no choice but tough talking. The success of New Labour was built on the ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"" slogan that Brown himself devised. Unless Labour can prove itself as patriotic, as ready to fight and as ready to punish wrongdoers as the Tories, it will lose, lose and lose again. True, Blair has taken this game into extreme overkill, fighting more wars and locking up more criminals than any other government. But no Labour leader can survive if they fail the ""toughness"" test.With Brown, more lies beneath the rhetoric. Everyone is for ""reform"": he hints that his might be of a different hue. Tucked into yesterday's tough speech on security was a balancing thoughtfulness on stronger democratic accountability and shoring up civil liberties, and a seriousness about rights, with radical constitutional proposals to come. There are layers of ideas wrapped inside his flag as he strives to reclaim patriotism and Britishness for the progressive cause. It sounds so counterintuitive and unconvincing to many Labour ears that it may be a hopeless task - but it does make him unassailable by the Tories. He promises more optimistic themes in speeches to follow - easing the hardship of the lives of those ""hardworking"" families so often extolled by politicians, with more to come on social justice, children and opportunity.But he can say little while cemented into the Blair footprints. Hints and briefings are not much to go on, leaving his party clutching at straws: some will point despairingly at Brown's ultra-caution, secretiveness and failure to castigate boardroom greed. The economic dysfunction caused by gross income inequality never draws a murmur of disapproval. Some doubters worry it will be more of the same, but without Blair's magic appeal to the middle classes.Just wait until he gets his freedom, say his supporters. There will be a cornucopia of surprises, an opening up of government in a style to confound his critics. Purpose, drive and dynamism will bring the renewal this party needs.Whichever it is to be, even those wary of Brown now join his enthusiasts in just wanting to get the waiting over. At Blackpool I stopped 15 local delegates in a row, including some Labour party stewards. That's hardly a significant sample, but every single one said unequivocally that Blair should go by the summer and let the party start again at the autumn conference. Until he goes this will remain a fractious party in a state of suspended animation."

Only 100% perfect medicine will do now, with zero mistakes and zero below-average treatment (a statistical impossibility). Without statistics, any bad anecdote lets the press ring the death knell for a non-viable, non-survivable health service.   No such excited attention greeted the first annual report of the NHS modernisation board, the body which oversees the government's 10-year plan, on which sit leaders of the royal colleges of doctors and nurses, trade unions, managers and the independent Kings Fund. Barely reported, (not at all in most papers), here is the first annual assessment of what is actually happening. This is no New Labour spin machine, for on this board sit those who shout loudest when things get bad: they have no vested interest in glossing the facts, especially as many are in the middle of tricky NHS contract negotiations.   Their report charts progress so far, not startling, but progress: 597 new critical care beds, 714 new general beds, 500 more secure mental beds, 10,000 more nurses, four new medical schools to double doctors in training, 10 new major hospitals, free nursing care for people in nursing homes, 150 new rapid access chest pain clinics, 797 GPs surgeries modernised, 42 new high street walk-in health centres, 5.75m patients using the new NHS Direct telephone advice service, and more. But some of the ""successes"" only serve to remind us how far there is still to go: 60% of GP surgeries now see patients within 48 hours, (hardly a triumph). The number of people waiting more than 15 months for their operation fell by a third but was still 8,100 (to be eliminated by 2005). Meanwhile, seven out of 10 were treated within three months. It is not much of a boast that no hospital now has ""red"" alert status for dirt, while more are still ""yellow"" than top class ""green"" clean. But the money is at last flowing in - 21 new MRI scanners, 52 CT scanners and so on.   For all that, the killer anecdote will always win. Meanwhile consider the absence of some old stories. Leading NHS figures, like Lord Winston, are no longer blowing the whistle, as they rightly did on Labour's disastrous first two low-spending years. So far, for the second year running there has been no winter beds crisis. The NHS dog is no longer barking, even if it is too early to start wagging its tail.   However good the NHS may become, the front pages of the 75% Conservative press will still proclaim it is getting worse. Tory hopes are pinned on persuading voters this failed ""Stalinist"" institution can only be saved by a dose of privatisation. As a tactic it works: Labour did the same with its own outrageous ""24 hours to save the NHS"" slogan at the 1997 election. It is lethal for public trust in the NHS, but all politicians kick it about recklessly for their own self-interest. The recent Telegraph poll showed how voters are swayed: two thirds think the NHS is in bad shape. Yet asked about their personal experience, 86% are happy with their GP and 77% happy with their hospital treatment. What can the NHS do when people believe the Daily Mail more than the evidence of their own lives?   The answer has to come from within the NHS itself. Those doctors and nurses who speak out in bad times must get used to the idea of publicly defending it in good times against its predators. Tory ideas are flowing fast: Iain Duncan Smith posits getting people to pay to visit GPs. Professor Tim Congdon, Tory economic guru, this week publishes a pamphlet calling for state spending to shrink from 40% to 25% of GDP, cutting public services to a rump with minimal vouchers for health and education to be cashed in private facilities. ""Over time extra expenditure would have to be financed by parents, patients and citizens, as they saw fit."" It is not just the usual Tory extremists who now play around with the idea that the NHS is beyond repair, a 1940s outfit unfit for the 21st century and the like.   The prime minister and Alan Milburn deserve their own share of the blame. It is time to stop floating a clever new NHS wheeze every week. It is time they started to stand up for the basic principles of the NHS, proclaiming its growing strength and encouraging its staff. Nuts and bolts reforms being implemented by the modernisation board are bearing fruit. The more Labour talks up radical ideas using the word ""private"", the more they undermine trust and confirm the Tory story that an ideological revolution is required: their own facts and figures suggest otherwise.","So, who won it for George Bush this time? Unlike 2000, when it took a 5-4 majority among the judges on the US supreme court to deliver the White House to the Republicans, the answer in 2004 lay firmly in the ballot box. A clear majority of all voters across the US gave Mr Bush a 51%-48% margin in the popular vote to go with his expected narrow victory in the electoral college.How was that electoral college majority made up? Once again, Mr Bush won a clear majority of states, with 28 in the bag by yesterday, compared with John Kerry's 19 (plus the District of Columbia), and three states still undecided. With only Iowa, Ohio and New Mexico still to declare, only a single state - tiny New Hampshire - had switched allegiance since 2000, voting Democrat this time instead of Republican.In the Bush era, the electoral map of the US has therefore consolidated into a great swath of ""red states"" - confusingly for Europeans the colour of the more rightwing party - stretching across the middle of the country from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, contrasted with clusters of Democratic ""blue states"" on the margins - the Pacific coast (plus Hawaii but not Alaska), the upper midwest centred on the western Great Lakes, and Mr Kerry's home region of the north-east.That picture contains a vivid reminder of several of the truths of modern presidential politics. The Republicans command rural America and have a narrow majority in the suburbs, while the Democrats are stronger in the old cities. But perhaps the most important piece of US electoral geography is in the south. Ever since the Democrats ensured that black Americans in the southern states got the right to vote in the 1960s, the south has swung ever more conclusively into the Republican camp. That pattern continued this week.Neither Al Gore in 2000 nor Mr Kerry this year managed to win a single southern state. Significantly, the only two Democrats who have won the presidency since black Americans got the vote in the south have been southern governors: Jimmy Carter of Georgia in 1976 and Bill Clinton of Arkansas in 1992 and 1996. The lesson for Democrats contemplating the task in 2008 is clear: they must have a southern strategy - or perish.But it was not just the south and the heartlands that won it for Mr Bush this week. It was also American men, and American white men in particular. Mr Bush beat Mr Kerry 54% to 45% among male voters, while Mr Kerry won almost as comfortably, 52% to 47%, among women. This confirms a striking electoral contrast between the US and western Europe, including Britain. In Europe, by and large, men vote to the left of women. In America, it is the other way round; there men vote to the right of women.  The real eye-opener, though, was Mr Bush's success among white voters, where the president captured a remarkable 61% of all white male votes (against Mr Kerry's 38%), along with 54% of white female votes (Mr Kerry trailed with 45%). No Democratic presidential candidate has captured a majority of the white electorate in the US since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Mr Kerry did no better than his several predecessors. It may be many years before it happens again. In the south, Mr Bush outpolled Mr Kerry by more than two-to-one among white Americans.Among the ethnic minorities overall, Mr Bush did much less well, though he nevertheless managed to improve his numbers. Among African Americans, he took a mere 11%, two points better than in 2000, but eclipsed by Mr Kerry's 89%. Among Latino voters, on the other hand, Mr Bush pushed his share up from 35% four years ago to 42% this time, a telling score for the future, as the disproportionately young Latino electorate expands. The president's successors will have to do even better than this to keep states like Florida, Arizona and even Mr Bush's home state of Texas from falling eventually into Democratic hands. Mr Bush took 56% of Latino votes in Florida this time, a key reason for his success in this crucial state.The generation gap showed up powerfully this week, too. First-time voters and 18-29s leaned towards Mr Kerry by 54%-44%, but expectations that a great rush of new voters (55% of whom backed Mr Kerry) would swing the election for the Democrats proved unfounded. Mr Bush meanwhile had narrow leads among early and late middle-aged voters, as well as a strong lead (58%-41%) among married voters with children. Voters aged over 60 leaned more heavily than others towards Mr Bush.Not surprisingly, richer voters were disproportionately for Mr Bush and poorer voters for his challenger. Union members leaned towards Mr Kerry by nearly two to one, but people in full-time work narrowly went for Mr Bush.  Religion's place as a key political indicator - and as a central explanation of Mr Bush's success - was also confirmed on Tuesday. Regular churchgoers voted for Mr Bush by nearly two-to-one. The president had a 13-point lead among Protestant voters, managed almost a tie with the Catholic Mr Kerry among Catholic voters, but trailed badly among traditionally Democratic Jewish voters, especially in Florida. But Mr Bush's strength among evangelical Protestants, especially strong in the south, was prodigious, with 76% of this group supporting him.Mr Bush also scored heavily over Mr Kerry among gun owners (59%-39%) and among military veterans (55%-43%). Mr Kerry, on the other hand, had a commanding lead among gay and lesbian voters (78%-21%), a much smaller group than the other two.Iraq confirmed its role as a key indicator in the 2004 contest, with 85% of those who approved the initial decision to go to war supporting Mr Bush and 87% of those who opposed it supporting Mr Kerry instead.As the opinion polls had suggested for many weeks, only a small number of voters decided who to vote for in the final week of the contest. Among those who did so, Mr Kerry had a 53%-45% advantage, rather less than poll experts would normally expect. The great majority of Americans, though - nearly 80% - say they decided who to vote for long ago. Among these, Mr Bush led by 52%-47%. The president, in other words, probably had the 2004 election in the bag all along."
1,"What's gone wrong with the war? So far, four weeks in, nothing much. No disasters, beyond a near-botched small raid that left behind a slice of helicopter and an American soldier's foot - hardly Arnhem. Opinion polls right across Europe continue to support the war. Far from wobbling, EU leaders were angered at having offers of troops rejected. How is the war going? We know bald facts. Some 7,000 bombs and missiles have been dropped on the 118 designated targets, missing six of them. Cluster bombs have been used against five targets - an al-Qaida camp and four Taliban military installations. Most observers think it unlikely there have been heavy civilian casualties: officials give no estimates for fear of sounding callous about those there have been. The true picture will only emerge afterwards: in Kosovo there were many fewer than feared.  There is no reason to think the fight to remove the Taliban is bogged down or in any particular trouble. There is an observable steady increase in activity with B-52s bombing the front line (not ""carpet bombing"" Dresden-style, when vast formations wiped whole cities). Many Taliban soldiers are dead, but a certain reticence stops officials saying that either.  Reports showing the Northern Alliance doing nothing much, waiting just a few miles from Kabul and Mazar within easy sight of the Taliban on the other side look lackadaisical. Why don't they get on with it? For the very good reason that they are in no hurry to get their men killed. What's the rush? Their civil war has been going on for years and time is on their side. Why not just sit and watch bombs do most of the work? In Kosovo, bombing lasted three months; in Kuwait it lasted six months before ground attack.  Time is not on the side of starving Afghans facing winter. Retorting sharply to a Taliban call for more UN help, UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said yesterday: ""The UNHCR and our partner agencies have had our vehicles stolen, our offices taken over and our staff beaten. It has not been easy ... The breakdown in law and order has made it difficult to distribute aid. What we would like from the Taliban is the return of our offices and assets and a guarantee that our people on the ground won't be hassled by armed men."" Bombing is not the only obstacle to aid. Kenzo Oshima, the UN's under- secretary general for humanitarian affairs, told the Today programme: ""There have been some calls for a pause ... but I wonder whether that really helps. As a matter of fact, military strikes have not hampered in any significant way the delivery of assistance."" The race against time is to remove the Taliban before they let more Afhgans starve.  Time is also not on the side of the news-hungry, who need daily signs of progress. ""In for the kill!"" promised the Mirror headline yesterday in full here-we-go bloodrush. But the Big Push may not happen. Beyond the occasional glimpse through a keyhole at a tiny part of a plan, everyone is left guessing. Officials warn of a long campaign of mostly invisible forays into Taliban territory, lasting beyond a new broad-based government arriving in power.  Public opinion in the west lacks the Northern Alliance's patience, (maybe because they are not on the frontline). Seeing only distant puffs of smoke, a queasy public is left to imagine the worst - civilian bloodshed and a military stalemate. Air war is always a public relations disaster. To modern societies it looks cowardly, disobeying some notional chivalric rules, as if war were a game. Bombardment works, making victory less dangerous, but it doesn't satisfy the Hollywood version of what war should be.  The sight of western troops going over the top would be more satisfying: hand to hand fighting is ""fairer"". An action movie needs a moral script ensuring the good guy wins against the odds, not with the odds heavily stacked on his side from the start. It is a kind of decadence to forget that only one thing matters - the right side must win. Few seriously doubt the Taliban will fall, with Bin Laden either es caped or caught and the UN will be installed for years, to guarantee peace and human rights in this anarchic land.  After that, what is ""winning"" in the longer run? Does President Bush really understand the enormous implications? America has been brutally awoken from a solipsistic dream of its own virtue to find itself hated in ways it never knew. Now it is painfully aware of a vulnerability that will last until America genuinely becomes the force for good it always imagined itself to be.  The first test comes in Doha where the WTO talks open on Friday, when the US delegation arrives in Qatar with gas masks and emergency supplies, as vivid reminders. Their attitude towards opening markets to benefit poor countries will reveal whether the US has really understood. Success in Doha matters desperately for a world economy on the verge of recession: one study reveals that cutting trade barriers by just one third would increase global income by $612bn. The poor world needs doors opened to its agriculture which means the US and the EU cutting back on its colossal and pointless agricultural subsidies. But will they put the urgent needs of developing countries who depend on agricultural exports above their own agriculture which forms only a very small part of their economies? Will they break the patents and give the poor world access to cheap medicines and tech nology? The rich put low tariffs on raw materials they need but high tariffs on imported finished products: the US charges 48% on imported sports footwear to protect its own industry.  The other test is Israel. As Sharon snubs the president, cancelling a visit to Washington and insulting him with talk of Nazi appeasement, the world looks on to see whether the US will insist its wayward client gets back to the peace process and shuts down the settlements snatched on Palestinian land. Then there is the lunacy of the US missile defence system. Will they press on at a price that could buy real security in the form of energy self-sufficiency with wind and solar power? Or will they squander any moral authority in the battle to stop nuclear proliferation? And there is the UN. The US could single-handedly breathe new life and finance into it, agreeing to sign up to provisions it has rejected - such as the international criminal court.  How victory in Afghanistan will look to the outside world depends on how America behaves in victory. Islamic fundamentalists and others who dismiss the UN human rights convention as a ""western"" construct will have every excuse to continue rejecting democracy, freedom for women and the rule of law if they still see double standards in how the west treats Israel and Palestine or double-dealing in trade with poor countries. Everything is now linked.","Another day, another front page NHS horror story. London's billboards were ablaze this week with an evening paper tale - ""94-year-old abandoned in casualty"". It was a good blood-boiler - a frail old lady who had fallen and concussed herself was left alone ""caked in blood"" and forgotten for three days in A and E for lack of a hospital bed. Except it wasn't true. There were beds, but she was kept under observation, moved to a room of her own and only sent to a ward when well enough. But despite the hospital's vigorous denials the story still appeared, repeated in the Daily Mail, deeply implanting in a million minds yet another nasty NHS snapshot.  The NHS is in grave danger - not from internal failure but from external attack. A war of anecdotes has replaced most attempts at careful analysis. It is more fun to write ""My hospital hell"", or ""My hospital heaven in a much better Spanish hospital"", ""My wonderful NHS birth experience"", or ""My neighbour's 10-hour wait for his son's cut finger"". Journalists who do not usually write about health feel quite at liberty to expound their own sudden brushes with medicine, good and bad, as if this were ""evidence"" of the state of the NHS, taking leave of the objective analysis they would apply to other subjects. Since I write about health, I am bombarded with friends' and colleagues' NHS sagas - good and bad - as if these were triumphant ""proof"" of anything. A head of a TV news service told me the   other day that he now ""knew"" the NHS could not survive: his wife had a bad NHS birth. Actually it was because the hospital at the time was undergoing a major maternity ward renovation, one of more than 200 around the country, costing 100m. To be sure the temporary decanting process had been abominably managed, but this was not the sign he took it to be that now we must reach for some radical privatising alternative.   Health stories are dynamite. Inordinate gleeful space and TV time is given to any medical calamity - last week's corker happened to come from a private hospital where a young mother died. As the NHS treats a million people a day, there will never be a shortage of such tales, as indeed, there never is in ""better"" Europe where just such horror stories of killer surgeons or fatal injections fill their tabloid pages too. In TV news rooms I see how pushy health correspondents, competing to get their faces on screen, can always elbow their way into the running order with some souped-up NHS crisis.

He was succeeded by Hu Jintao in November 2002.  <BR><BR>  <B><HR size=""1""></HR></B>  <BR><BR> Here are some things that people think. The majority of people, anyway. People think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best books ever written. People approve of the reintroduction of capital punishment (lethal injection, for preference). People want fox hunting banned. Their favourite song is Bohemian Rhapsody. People believe in ghosts and are in favour of identity cards. Their favourite meal is fish and chips and they feel sure GM food is a very bad thing. Almost half of them don't think the MMR jab is safe. People underestimate the hygiene complications of preparing a Christmas turkey. They have never heard of the European Constitution. They think parents have the right to know the name and address of any sex offender in the neighbourhood. They think parental selection of a baby's gender is so awful it should be banned. Mercifully, for those who deviate from the majority position on most of the above, the public view does not have to be emulated, or obeyed. We are not subject to its moronic line on literature, music or the paranormal. On gender selection, however, the feelings of the mob are to be enforced. When Suzy Leather, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, explained why this body, after a year's review, now advocates a ban on sex selection, the main reason adduced for the decision was that the majority of people say they don't like the idea. Or as Leather put it, there is ""a substantial public consensus against sex selection for social reasons"". In this area, then, the conduct of your private life is to be directed by public consultation backed by a Mori poll. Unless, that is, you have the energy and cash to defy the public fiat: sex selection is legally available, at a price, at private clinics in America and across the Channel.  Quite why ""people"" should be so against this ostensibly not very wicked expression of a preference is not easily understood. If people had concluded, having completed the relevant research, that gender selection might result in a great preponderance of girls or boys, or an increased number of abortions or incidence of neglect, then one might sympathise with their fears, when polled. The deputy chairman of the HFEA, Tom Baldwin, has said that much of the opposition sprang from ""widespread hostility"", and from anxieties about a ""slippery slope"". So it is not because sex selection was found wanting by the HFEA experts, you gather, so much as to assuage the public's nightmares about designer babies or hundreds of mini-Bin Ladens (quite understandable if you watch a lot of late-night television) that women such as Nicola Chenery, of Plymouth, who really wanted a daughter after her four boys, should now be prevented from having sex selection by IVF at a clinic in Spain. If this decisive body of technophobes had got their way a bit earlier, Chenery's twin baby girls would never have been born. How fortunate, in fact, that Mori polls were not in charge around the time IVF was invented. Ditto blood transfusion and heart transplants.  But it's true: slippery slopes can be awfully worrying. What, for example, are the implications of the HFEA's deferral to public opinion in a country where politicians customarily go to great lengths to avoid doing what the public actually wants? Should we now look forward to seeing paedophiles in the stocks, zero fuel tax, the prohibition of speed limits, a quick exit from Europe and the immediate expulsion of all asylum seekers?  The HFEA's recourse to public sentiment suggests that consultation should go much further than that. Most of us, after all, have some acquaintance with the issues of crime and of tax-paying, some opinion on public services. In the case of sex selection, there can be no recourse to experience or, even, to folk wisdom. It's a question many poll respondents might never have considered before - unless you count inclining, secretly, to one sex or the other.  If fertility experts on the Clapham omnibus can decide policy on gender selection as well as the outcome of Pop Idol, there is no reason why they should not be invited to rule on other scientific advances likely to prompt substantial ethical debate. Those clinicians currently hoping to attempt a facial transplant, for example, and the few gravely disfigured individuals who have expressed interest in the operation, may need to consider not only the profound questions of identity involved in such a procedure, but whether the public will, once again, be so utterly outraged by the affront to nature that doctors, ethicists and prospective patients must all bow to its opinion. <BR><BR><B>Presidents and the right to protest</B><BR><BR>Isn't it time we had Jiang Zemin round? It's been ages and on his last stay, thanks to Robin Cook's insistence on sparing the feelings of the Chinese president, he hardly got to meet anyone. Quite possibly he went home with the idea that the United Kingdom is, leaving aside 1,000-year-old eggs and the occasional peasouper, just like China. A ruthless police state in which any dissent is either concealed from visitors or suppressed, if necessary by violence. But after George Bush's visit, that should all be different, shouldn't it? Even those who maintain that Bush is the vilest ruler of the most evil empire that ever existed must concede that, if his visit helps restore the right to peaceful protest that Cook suddenly withdrew in 1991, it can't have been all bad. Next time Jiang comes to stay, the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens will want to make sure that he sees the welcoming Tibetan flags, banners and T-shirts instead of having all the human rights demonstrators obscured from the presidential view or dragged away by police. Unless, that is, Blair's government has no objection to our shouting abuse at passing democrats, who are probably used to that sort of thing, but draws the line at anything that might offend the sensitive visitor from less tolerant climes.  There's only one way to find out. Come back, Jiang, and next time, bring your mates.<BR><BR><B>Where are the women?</B><BR><BR>Was Patricia Hewitt well advised to make gleeful capital out of Michael Howard's almost all-male shadow cabinet? True, Howard's one-to-12 ratio is almost comically shameful (though he was apparently spurned by Ann Widdecombe). But is Blair's record with women so much better? After the departure, hurt, of Mowlam, Short and Morris, Blair's six senior women (out of a cabinet of 21) are: an extremely disturbed person called Margaret Hodge, who seems in need of a long rest; Tessa Jowell, who is probably busy with the Olympics; the tireless caravanner Margaret Beckett; the not-readily-identifiable Hilary Armstrong; Baroness Valerie Amos (appointed, doesn't count); and Patricia Hewitt herself, who is still having a little difficulty reconciling her 1970s feminism with the present day. The Labour ministers with big jobs, are, like Howard's favourites, all men. Until Labour gets closer to electing a woman leader, any triumphalism in this department looks distinctly premature."
1,"The ID-cards vote passed: however angry Labour MPs are at this succession of pointless provocations inflicted on them, there is sensible a limit to how much damage they will inflict on themselves. Plenty of them have much to fear in their own constituencies in this low season for Labour.Those who did spend a freezing wet weekend in Blackpool found the spring conference pretty dismal and dispiriting. It was planned as a rip-roaring celebration of Labour's glorious centenary, but few people came; there were few MPs, a smattering of ministers drafted in, and the press room was bare. Many constituency parties sent no delegates.The frail state of the grassroots was whispered often in the Winter Gardens. Hazel Blears and John Prescott, trying to bounce the party into a semblance of life with defibrillator jolts of demented optimism, rashly opined that parties which wither at the roots will die at the top. With most big cities lost and a massacre of remaining councils expected at the May elections, some constituency parties that have recently lost their MP, their council and most councillors are struggling to sustain the will to live. Now add in the Dunfermline result and it's not surprising that so few went to Blackpool. As the leadership interregnum drags on, it saps the blood of the party.Tony Blair turned in a below-par speech. But even belowpar and fading in power to convince, every time he steps up to a lectern he reminds them all of his political genius. It is the same in the Commons: he stands amid swelling backbench rebellion, yet on Wednesday mornings he can rouse his party to whooping glee as he lands punches on the bench opposite, reminding his own that they may miss him when he's gone. With all that vim and verve, no wonder he can't let go. So much still to do, so much to stop his successor doing.It is human instinct to clutch after immortality, leaving a footstep in the shifting sand. But political leaders crave it with unnatural passion. Blair is trying to force his legacy on to his successor, fixing Gordon Brown's feet in concrete into his own footsteps. The so-called ""dual prime minister"" scenario described by Charles Clarke looks more like the grizzly embrace of death, the dying man holding the future leader in a deadly grip with his last gasp.In this terminal phase, Brown has no option but to obey. So out he goes to bat for the ID cards he used to think wildly too expensive. In his speech yesterday on security, he even made a reasonable stab at pretending a pressing need for the ""glorification of terrorism"" clause, which virtually no one in the Commons believes. His speeches are taking a Churchillian turn as he reprises his Britishness theme, calling for ceremonies in every constituency for Veterans' Day and new cadet schemes to instil military discipline in state-school pupils. ""We will not yield, relax, rest, become complacent or lower our guard but will use every means, every necessary resource..."" and more, to fight terror.The daily taunts from the Tories (and some Blairites) that Brown will abandon ""reform"" to lead Labour back to its dark days of producer interests and union power seem to be hitting their mark. In response, no flag is big enough, no trumpet loud enough, no dead hero's memorial tall enough - Brown must add to their patriotic clamour.It may not gladden the hearts of those hoping that his premiership will herald renewal, optimism and progressive enthusiasm. Every time Brown parrots the need for ""reform, reform, reform"" as defined by Blair, spirits in the party sink a bit lower. But he has no choice. He is destined to follow Blair's footsteps every inch of the way - until the old leader finally departs and discovers that no prime minister can ever command the future beyond his time.All this tells us very little of what to expect when Brown's day finally comes. Expect no more than a tiny flash of the cardinal's red lining in what he says now. Whether once in power he will ever give more than the odd tantalising glimpse, it's hard to know. But for now he has no choice but tough talking. The success of New Labour was built on the ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"" slogan that Brown himself devised. Unless Labour can prove itself as patriotic, as ready to fight and as ready to punish wrongdoers as the Tories, it will lose, lose and lose again. True, Blair has taken this game into extreme overkill, fighting more wars and locking up more criminals than any other government. But no Labour leader can survive if they fail the ""toughness"" test.With Brown, more lies beneath the rhetoric. Everyone is for ""reform"": he hints that his might be of a different hue. Tucked into yesterday's tough speech on security was a balancing thoughtfulness on stronger democratic accountability and shoring up civil liberties, and a seriousness about rights, with radical constitutional proposals to come. There are layers of ideas wrapped inside his flag as he strives to reclaim patriotism and Britishness for the progressive cause. It sounds so counterintuitive and unconvincing to many Labour ears that it may be a hopeless task - but it does make him unassailable by the Tories. He promises more optimistic themes in speeches to follow - easing the hardship of the lives of those ""hardworking"" families so often extolled by politicians, with more to come on social justice, children and opportunity.But he can say little while cemented into the Blair footprints. Hints and briefings are not much to go on, leaving his party clutching at straws: some will point despairingly at Brown's ultra-caution, secretiveness and failure to castigate boardroom greed. The economic dysfunction caused by gross income inequality never draws a murmur of disapproval. Some doubters worry it will be more of the same, but without Blair's magic appeal to the middle classes.Just wait until he gets his freedom, say his supporters. There will be a cornucopia of surprises, an opening up of government in a style to confound his critics. Purpose, drive and dynamism will bring the renewal this party needs.Whichever it is to be, even those wary of Brown now join his enthusiasts in just wanting to get the waiting over. At Blackpool I stopped 15 local delegates in a row, including some Labour party stewards. That's hardly a significant sample, but every single one said unequivocally that Blair should go by the summer and let the party start again at the autumn conference. Until he goes this will remain a fractious party in a state of suspended animation.","What's gone wrong with the war? So far, four weeks in, nothing much. No disasters, beyond a near-botched small raid that left behind a slice of helicopter and an American soldier's foot - hardly Arnhem. Opinion polls right across Europe continue to support the war. Far from wobbling, EU leaders were angered at having offers of troops rejected. How is the war going? We know bald facts. Some 7,000 bombs and missiles have been dropped on the 118 designated targets, missing six of them. Cluster bombs have been used against five targets - an al-Qaida camp and four Taliban military installations. Most observers think it unlikely there have been heavy civilian casualties: officials give no estimates for fear of sounding callous about those there have been. The true picture will only emerge afterwards: in Kosovo there were many fewer than feared.  There is no reason to think the fight to remove the Taliban is bogged down or in any particular trouble. There is an observable steady increase in activity with B-52s bombing the front line (not ""carpet bombing"" Dresden-style, when vast formations wiped whole cities). Many Taliban soldiers are dead, but a certain reticence stops officials saying that either.  Reports showing the Northern Alliance doing nothing much, waiting just a few miles from Kabul and Mazar within easy sight of the Taliban on the other side look lackadaisical. Why don't they get on with it? For the very good reason that they are in no hurry to get their men killed. What's the rush? Their civil war has been going on for years and time is on their side. Why not just sit and watch bombs do most of the work? In Kosovo, bombing lasted three months; in Kuwait it lasted six months before ground attack.  Time is not on the side of starving Afghans facing winter. Retorting sharply to a Taliban call for more UN help, UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said yesterday: ""The UNHCR and our partner agencies have had our vehicles stolen, our offices taken over and our staff beaten. It has not been easy ... The breakdown in law and order has made it difficult to distribute aid. What we would like from the Taliban is the return of our offices and assets and a guarantee that our people on the ground won't be hassled by armed men."" Bombing is not the only obstacle to aid. Kenzo Oshima, the UN's under- secretary general for humanitarian affairs, told the Today programme: ""There have been some calls for a pause ... but I wonder whether that really helps. As a matter of fact, military strikes have not hampered in any significant way the delivery of assistance."" The race against time is to remove the Taliban before they let more Afhgans starve.  Time is also not on the side of the news-hungry, who need daily signs of progress. ""In for the kill!"" promised the Mirror headline yesterday in full here-we-go bloodrush. But the Big Push may not happen. Beyond the occasional glimpse through a keyhole at a tiny part of a plan, everyone is left guessing. Officials warn of a long campaign of mostly invisible forays into Taliban territory, lasting beyond a new broad-based government arriving in power.  Public opinion in the west lacks the Northern Alliance's patience, (maybe because they are not on the frontline). Seeing only distant puffs of smoke, a queasy public is left to imagine the worst - civilian bloodshed and a military stalemate. Air war is always a public relations disaster. To modern societies it looks cowardly, disobeying some notional chivalric rules, as if war were a game. Bombardment works, making victory less dangerous, but it doesn't satisfy the Hollywood version of what war should be.  The sight of western troops going over the top would be more satisfying: hand to hand fighting is ""fairer"". An action movie needs a moral script ensuring the good guy wins against the odds, not with the odds heavily stacked on his side from the start. It is a kind of decadence to forget that only one thing matters - the right side must win. Few seriously doubt the Taliban will fall, with Bin Laden either es caped or caught and the UN will be installed for years, to guarantee peace and human rights in this anarchic land.  After that, what is ""winning"" in the longer run? Does President Bush really understand the enormous implications? America has been brutally awoken from a solipsistic dream of its own virtue to find itself hated in ways it never knew. Now it is painfully aware of a vulnerability that will last until America genuinely becomes the force for good it always imagined itself to be.  The first test comes in Doha where the WTO talks open on Friday, when the US delegation arrives in Qatar with gas masks and emergency supplies, as vivid reminders. Their attitude towards opening markets to benefit poor countries will reveal whether the US has really understood. Success in Doha matters desperately for a world economy on the verge of recession: one study reveals that cutting trade barriers by just one third would increase global income by $612bn. The poor world needs doors opened to its agriculture which means the US and the EU cutting back on its colossal and pointless agricultural subsidies. But will they put the urgent needs of developing countries who depend on agricultural exports above their own agriculture which forms only a very small part of their economies? Will they break the patents and give the poor world access to cheap medicines and tech nology? The rich put low tariffs on raw materials they need but high tariffs on imported finished products: the US charges 48% on imported sports footwear to protect its own industry.  The other test is Israel. As Sharon snubs the president, cancelling a visit to Washington and insulting him with talk of Nazi appeasement, the world looks on to see whether the US will insist its wayward client gets back to the peace process and shuts down the settlements snatched on Palestinian land. Then there is the lunacy of the US missile defence system. Will they press on at a price that could buy real security in the form of energy self-sufficiency with wind and solar power? Or will they squander any moral authority in the battle to stop nuclear proliferation? And there is the UN. The US could single-handedly breathe new life and finance into it, agreeing to sign up to provisions it has rejected - such as the international criminal court.  How victory in Afghanistan will look to the outside world depends on how America behaves in victory. Islamic fundamentalists and others who dismiss the UN human rights convention as a ""western"" construct will have every excuse to continue rejecting democracy, freedom for women and the rule of law if they still see double standards in how the west treats Israel and Palestine or double-dealing in trade with poor countries. Everything is now linked."

Until he goes this will remain a fractious party in a state of suspended animation.","The NHS is under-resourced. Every user knows it. Its staff know it. The political establishment accepts it. The Prime Minister has admitted as much. Britain has fewer doctors and hospital beds per head than almost any other country in Europe. More needs to be spent, so when Blair committed himself last week to raising health expenditure to the European average by the end of the next parliament there should have been a national sense of relief. Instead it was an occasion for hand-wringing, Prime Ministerial wobble and general disbelief.  It couldn't be done, it was said. There isn't and there won't be enough money. Blair was dodging difficult choices about which taxes to raise. The Conservatives insisted that the only means to this end was to allow the private sector to lead the charge, urging the reintroduction of tax relief for private health insurance. And then Number 10 seemed to get windy, briefing on Monday that it was only an aspiration - and conditional in any case on the economy doing well.   But for once beleaguered liberal Britain should not look a gift horse in the mouth; this is an occasion for a cheer. The Prime Minister, despite his partial retreat, has set an important benchmark for the desirable growth of NHS spending, and by implication other key programmes such as education and transport. He has also put down a marker that the extraordinarily large Treasury surpluses projected in the years ahead will be spent on improving   public services and not given away in tax cuts. And he has put the Tories on the spot; they have to match his commitment or demonstrate that private health insurance can achieve the same result - a demonstration that is beyond them. In the new politics of how to spend the budget surpluses, Blair - panicked perhaps by the hysterical reaction to the comparatively small rise in flu cases and media overkill - has set the political agenda. It is an important moment.   The scale of the implied increase in NHS spending is vast. The 50 billion (in round numbers) spent on the NHS in Britain at the moment is 5.7 per cent of GDP; another 9bn - or 1 per cent of GDP - is spent on health privately. The crude European average is 8 per cent of GDP, but that is simply arrived at by adding up each country's average and dividing it by the total, so that Luxembourg's spending has the same importance as Germany's. If you weight the calculation by size of country, the real average of European health spending, according to the King's Fund, is 8.6 per cent of GDP.   Because the Blair Government does not plan to expand the private health sector, it will have to pay to close the gap of 1.9 per cent of GDP itself - 17bn at today's prices. If it wants to do that over the next six years, health spending will have to rise by just under 8 per cent a year in real terms to 2006; if spending grows at only 5 per cent annum in real terms - the figure the Prime Minister cited - then it will take a full 12 years to reach the true European average. And if the Europeans further increase spending, then it will take longer still. It takes time to redress a generation of neglect.   Can 8 per cent growth in NHS spending until 2006 be achieved without raising taxes? The straight answer is yes, even though it would push Gordon Brown's demanding framework for spending and borrowing to the limit. But spending in every other department   could only grow in line with the growth of GDP, the reason for Cabinet restiveness last week.   If this is a surprise, it is because almost nobody seems to have come to terms with the transformation in public finances under New Labour. The combination of Brown's 'stealth' taxes, equivalent to more than 2 per cent of GDP, sticking to the Conservatives' spending plans for the first two years of this parliament, economic growth of close to 2 per cent instead of recession in 1999, the fall in unemployment and continuing low inflation has been stunning. The current budget surplus last year was 7bn; it will more than double by 2003.   Indeed if the long run economic growth rate is the 2.5 per cent now assumed by the Treasury, then as the TUC calculated in its submission to the Treasury's Spending Review last week, public spending could be raised another 12bn by 2004 and, on my calculations, to the necessary 17bn for the NHS by 2006 - and still leave the 7bn safety margin Brown had last year.   If growth turns out lower, then the NHS budget can be protected by running down the safety margin; and in an economic downturn borrowing is allowed even under Brown's rules. A European class health service is ours for the having - and without raising taxes.   The Conservative proposition that the alternative can be achieved through private insurance is for the birds and, while New Labour retreats and tem porises in so many areas of policy, it is good to see some iron in its soul over private medical insurance. It is expensive, focused on those who are good medical risks, and rarely extends to the over-75s who are most in need. Worse, even if it worked in building up the private sector, it would have the perverse result of driving up the NHS's cost as private contractors bid up wages to attract the limited number of trained staff.   But the proof is in the pudding. Tax relief on medical insurance for the over-60s was introduced in 1990; but by 1997, when Labour abolished it, only 1 per cent more of the over-60s had taken advantage of the tax break. Moreover as the human genome project is completed, we will soon know each individual's DNA structure and predicted health experience; in this emerging world private insurance is madness, because those known to be poor risks will simply not be able to insure themselves at a reasonable premium. Poor Liam Fox, the Shadow Health Secretary, is stuck with a ludicrous, provenly unworkable policy that is out of kilter with the times - the mirror image of Labour's 1983 far-fetched commitment to extend nationalisation to promote economic efficiency.   The only way to fund the NHS is through general taxation or comprehensive social insurance; the hypothecated health tax is another blind alley. If all NHS spending is dependent on a stand-alone or hypothecated tax, then its revenues will go up and down with the economic cycle; if only part is hypothecated, then by the second or third year it becomes impossible to disentangle what is new and what is old money.   On the NHS New Labour is making a stand. What it needs to do next is to drop building privately financed hospitals with fewer beds, genuinely end the internal market and redress the system's disgraceful lack accountability - and we really could start cheering."
1,"The land of the free now wields an absolute power, free of responsibility, such as the world has never known. The rest of the globe watches its elections with renewed anguish as powerless spectators and demi-subjects. The two conventions displayed all that is most repugnant and alien in a political system corrupted beyond recognition in the democratic world. The $100m campaigns lift off in an obscene haze of sanctimonious, lachrymose religiosity, oozing family unction and lies. With 77 days to go and contenders neck and neck in the polls, George W Bush says that Jesus is his guiding influence, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman share a prayer with reporters and both campaigns promise instant gratification and no sacrifice for anything or anyone ever. Dishonest fantasy politics turn America into an out-of-control, self-absorbed, infantilised monster. The richer, stronger and more globally unaccountable America becomes, the more self-centred its politics grows. The end of the cold war should have brought great psychological dividends. Generous in global victory, free of paranoia and with wealth beyond imagining, here at last was its chance to become what it has always believed itself to be - the brave, the beautiful, the free and so on. The high-flown rhetoric of the conventions is echoed in every high school valedictory speech, in every rotary and church, pledging allegiance to a constitution that has lost any vision of society beyond the pursuit of happiness. God's chosen people, uniquely blessed, nurture a self-image almost as deranged in its profound self-delusion as the old Soviet Union. The most advanced, knowledgeable, educated, psychoanalysed, therapised nation on earth knows nothing of itself, irony-free and blind to the world around it.  This is the indictment:   Global warming: both poles are now melting and the process can never be stopped or reversed without America. The US federal government report on climate change itself predicted a 5-10C heat increase this century, with attendant fires, droughts and floods. A quarter of the world's population consumes 80% of its energy, most in the US. At Kyoto the US agreed to a very modest 7% cut in emissions by 2010. Congress refused to ratify it and since then America's emissions have increased by over 20%. The Republicans deny the cause of global warming, Democrats say nothing of cuts. As a result other countries are now sliding out of Kyoto promises, finding loopholes. Why should politicians in France or Germany take huge political pain in demanding cuts from their voters when the monster across the Atlantic goes on guzzling? With global power should come global responsibility to lead, but it doesn't.   Defence: Congress's refusal to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty last October virtually urges others to acquire their own weapons.   The Bush camp talks of tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Both parties are committed to the insane national missile defence system, putting the US under an umbrella protecting it from imaginary threats by ""rogue"" states that might lob a missile across, presumably unafraid of retaliation. It will end the old mutually assured destruction policy by which the world survived the cold war. Costing $60bn, it works even less well than the smart bombs of recent wars but still arouses fear and anger in China and Russia. Zbigniew Brzezinski calls it the mentality of the ""internationally gated community"".   Such isolationism will make the US role as a good global police force less likely: already political cowardice at losing any US soldier's life damaged its moral credibility in a genuinely unself-interested intervention in Kosovo.   The third world: the US promised $600m towards the relief of third-world debt, with 25 countries partly aided by the end of this year. Not a penny has been paid because Congress refused. The rhetoric was good - a recent US poll showed half the population thought the   problem already solved - but even Uganda, the exemplary ""good"" poor country, has still received nothing. Following US parsimony, the EU and Japan have been dragging their heels too. If the world's richest country, whose GNP has risen by a third in five years, hasn't paid, why should anyone else? Then there are the world trade negotiations, wrecked instead of saved by US political selfishness.   Poverty: a nation that does next to nothing about its own poor is unlikely to offer much to other countries. While US stock market values have increased five-fold in a decade, with half of all shares owned by 1% of the people, welfare has been cut to a five-year lifetime limit. With 40% of the people not covered by medical insurance, Medicare for the elderly is being cut by $115bn - and the Republicans promise far worse to come. Virtually all the income gains of the last five years have been enjoyed by the top 20% of the population. The real value of the minimum wage is still below what it was in John F Kennedy's day, income distribution as unequal as in the 1920s. (Bill Gates' wealth is equal to that of the entire bottom 40% of the nation). The poor go to jail in a country that imprisons more than any dictatorship - 5% of adult males are under ""correction"". Some 3,500 people await execution on death row; 580 have been executed since the Supreme Court lifted its ban.  This is not the portrait of a civilised modern state. We are deceived by history. We are deceived by the myriad   rainbow wonders of America, this mighty engine of invention and imagination, of creativity and enthusiasm from sea to shining sea. Europeans visit New York, San Francisco or Cape Cod, read the great American novelists and intellectuals, revel in America's popular culture, films and art and admire the super-sophistication of its academic discourse. It's rather like visiting St Petersburg before the revolution, wondering at the brilliance of Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov, Dostoevsky or maybe Faberg&eacute;, while trying to disregard the Tsar. The US constitution is kept on a mighty altar and lowered into a bomb-proof shelter at night as if it were indeed the guarantor of freedom: all it proves is that constitutions, freedoms of speech or information are only a small part of a good society. (The Soviet constitution was a pretty good document too.)  In elections there is always a better and worse. Bush is terrifying - in hock to oil and arms, promising a $1.3 trillion tax cut to the exclusive benefit of the top few. Gore is better. But whoever wins, America's dismal failure to address the key questions with any realism must strengthen European resolution on future unity. The life, views, values, ideas and politics of any town or village anywhere in the EU feels much more like home than any small town in middle America these days. The more we look at alien America, the more European we feel and the stronger we need to become.","The National Lottery plants its golden footprints up and down the land. And 12bn of good has been done so far: the Angel of the North spreads its iron wings, athletes hold gold medals aloft hailing the lottery that made them possible, the Eden project gleams within its glass domes, while hundreds of new community centres start thriving local activities. Decayed parks in towns everywhere are restored to Victorian municipal glory. A playgroup arises in an area with none. And, yes, asylum seekers get a little too.  But the lottery always had enemies. On the left puritans complain it is a regressive tax on the poor (though they don't propose banning Ladrokes). The moral right are uneasy at state-sponsored sin, but mainly loathe do-gooders. The result is sour sniping at everything the lottery does, emphasising the errors - the dome and the Churchill papers. But the latest war over grants to asylum seekers is doing real damage, destroying pride in its great benefits.   This is a story of folly and also of wickedness. Start with the folly: the Community Fund, one of the six boards distributing lottery largesse, gave money to the National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns (NCACD), a Birmingham group counselling asylum seekers on their rights, fighting deportations and getting many decisions successfully reversed. This is unpopular but necessary work: people should be helped to use what rights they have. They also campaign against the asylum laws, but that is not against charity law. All well and good. However, had the Community Fund glanced at the group's website, they would have found some wild, abusive stuff unbefitting lottery recipients. One group compared Bush to Hitler. The NCACD accused Blunkett of ""colluding with fascism"". Unwise.   When Blunkett learned of a relatively small story on page 5 in the Mail about this grant, he went nuclear. He could have picked up the telephone for a private word with Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary who oversees the lottery. Together they could have limited the damage quietly by calling the Community Fund and requesting them to ask the NCACD to clean up their language and their website. If the NCACD had two ounces of sense and hoped for future grants, it would have spontaneously issued a correction/apology and a polite press release describing the good work they do. But with the Mail on their doorstep, they were embattled.   What happened instead is that David Blunkett and his special adviser saw their chance for yet another of their regular nasty-story-for-the-Sundays slot. They constructed an inflammatory press release denouncing the grant. Tessa Jowell managed to get her hands on it in time and soften its language a bit, promising to review the grant. But Blunkett fanned the flames into a firestorm led by the Daily Mail, which day after day attacked the Community Fund with incendiary and racist ferocity. The Daily Mail gave a statement to Radio 4's World at One this week claiming that it was ""highlighting the activities of the Community Fund with the wholehearted support of the home secretary"". David Blunkett hotly denies this.   The Daily Mail's campaign against the Community Fund has on four days urged readers: ""Please vent your anger"" against Diana Brittan (wife of Sir Leon), head of the fund. Staff have been forced to open 4,000 abusive letters wearing gloves, since some contained excrement, reading ""I'm going to kill you"", ""fucking bitch"", ""fucking arsehole"" and more. The Midland office has had a bomb threat. Falkland's hero Simon Weston joined in with an anti-lottery diatribe at the Tory party conference, complaining veterans had been refused money. Why was he helping slaughter the golden goose, when his own charity, the Weston Spirit, has had 2m of lottery money with another three applications pending?    Not surprisingly, the fund went into meltdown and took too long to respond. Only 5% of its money goes to asylum seekers, 11% to ethnic minorities, and 5% to the third world, but yes, their remit is to give to less cuddly causes neglected by traditional giving. Their instructions are to fill the gaps, not follow popular sentiment. Any fund giving to smaller community groups makes some mistakes. One such was to give money to a man rescuing criminal youth from the streets: alas he was recruiting them to his own criminal gang. Was it the fund's fault? No. The man was an adviser to the police - if even the police didn't know, how could they?   Worse is to come. Next week it is likely the fund will be forced to announce that the NCACD grant will go ahead. Dearly though some might regret it, unless evidence emerges of law-breaking, the promised cash cannot be rescinded. Expect mushroom clouds. Camelot, itself is in trouble after the abysmal failure of their chief executive Diane Thompson's relaunch of new games, had the cheek last week to add petrol on the flames by claiming this asylum seekers' grant had cut lottery sales by 500,000 a week. (She said nothing about Camelot's own foundation's grants to asylum seekers). Camelot has yet to produce figures proving they are not disguising their own failures: Thompson's ""you'd be lucky to win a tenner"" Ratner remark, about the negligible chance of winning, didn't help.   Now every lottery hater has proclaimed the lottery undemocratic, demanding the right of lottery players to tick a box on their ticket to say where the money should go.   October 31 is the closing date for a public consultation on the lottery. Radical change is needed to repair its reputation, to make it trusted and loved. Jowell is seriously considering nationalisation: the fiasco of the last contract proved that no outsider can ever beat the incumbent. Where there is no competition, it would be wise to make it into a national institution, with no profits lost.   The six distribution boards will be amalgamated into one, with a single national lottery plaque emblazoned on every project that gets money, so people can see where the money is spent. Areas that have had too little funding - too deprived to apply - may get local referenda on how to spend lump sums. Democratic local citizens panels, (already in place for the Heritage Fund) may distribute money more accountably, gaining expertise as they go. When under fire, they would be better trusted to explain their spending decisions.   But big grants over 1m must still be taken centrally. It should not all flow to kittens and cancer at the behest of the tabloids. If the government gave in to pressure for tick boxes, it might temporarily stop tabloid insults about ""the liberal, lentil-chomping lefties who hand out Lotto cash"".   But granting funds at public whim would be a wicked abdication of the elected politicians' duty to see that all money is as wisely and justly spent as possible - give or take the odd inevitable mistake."
0,"The land of the free now wields an absolute power, free of responsibility, such as the world has never known. The rest of the globe watches its elections with renewed anguish as powerless spectators and demi-subjects. The two conventions displayed all that is most repugnant and alien in a political system corrupted beyond recognition in the democratic world. The $100m campaigns lift off in an obscene haze of sanctimonious, lachrymose religiosity, oozing family unction and lies. With 77 days to go and contenders neck and neck in the polls, George W Bush says that Jesus is his guiding influence, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman share a prayer with reporters and both campaigns promise instant gratification and no sacrifice for anything or anyone ever. Dishonest fantasy politics turn America into an out-of-control, self-absorbed, infantilised monster. The richer, stronger and more globally unaccountable America becomes, the more self-centred its politics grows. The end of the cold war should have brought great psychological dividends. Generous in global victory, free of paranoia and with wealth beyond imagining, here at last was its chance to become what it has always believed itself to be - the brave, the beautiful, the free and so on. The high-flown rhetoric of the conventions is echoed in every high school valedictory speech, in every rotary and church, pledging allegiance to a constitution that has lost any vision of society beyond the pursuit of happiness. God's chosen people, uniquely blessed, nurture a self-image almost as deranged in its profound self-delusion as the old Soviet Union. The most advanced, knowledgeable, educated, psychoanalysed, therapised nation on earth knows nothing of itself, irony-free and blind to the world around it.  This is the indictment:   Global warming: both poles are now melting and the process can never be stopped or reversed without America. The US federal government report on climate change itself predicted a 5-10C heat increase this century, with attendant fires, droughts and floods. A quarter of the world's population consumes 80% of its energy, most in the US. At Kyoto the US agreed to a very modest 7% cut in emissions by 2010. Congress refused to ratify it and since then America's emissions have increased by over 20%. The Republicans deny the cause of global warming, Democrats say nothing of cuts. As a result other countries are now sliding out of Kyoto promises, finding loopholes. Why should politicians in France or Germany take huge political pain in demanding cuts from their voters when the monster across the Atlantic goes on guzzling? With global power should come global responsibility to lead, but it doesn't.   Defence: Congress's refusal to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty last October virtually urges others to acquire their own weapons.   The Bush camp talks of tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Both parties are committed to the insane national missile defence system, putting the US under an umbrella protecting it from imaginary threats by ""rogue"" states that might lob a missile across, presumably unafraid of retaliation. It will end the old mutually assured destruction policy by which the world survived the cold war. Costing $60bn, it works even less well than the smart bombs of recent wars but still arouses fear and anger in China and Russia. Zbigniew Brzezinski calls it the mentality of the ""internationally gated community"".   Such isolationism will make the US role as a good global police force less likely: already political cowardice at losing any US soldier's life damaged its moral credibility in a genuinely unself-interested intervention in Kosovo.   The third world: the US promised $600m towards the relief of third-world debt, with 25 countries partly aided by the end of this year. Not a penny has been paid because Congress refused. The rhetoric was good - a recent US poll showed half the population thought the   problem already solved - but even Uganda, the exemplary ""good"" poor country, has still received nothing. Following US parsimony, the EU and Japan have been dragging their heels too. If the world's richest country, whose GNP has risen by a third in five years, hasn't paid, why should anyone else? Then there are the world trade negotiations, wrecked instead of saved by US political selfishness.   Poverty: a nation that does next to nothing about its own poor is unlikely to offer much to other countries. While US stock market values have increased five-fold in a decade, with half of all shares owned by 1% of the people, welfare has been cut to a five-year lifetime limit. With 40% of the people not covered by medical insurance, Medicare for the elderly is being cut by $115bn - and the Republicans promise far worse to come. Virtually all the income gains of the last five years have been enjoyed by the top 20% of the population. The real value of the minimum wage is still below what it was in John F Kennedy's day, income distribution as unequal as in the 1920s. (Bill Gates' wealth is equal to that of the entire bottom 40% of the nation). The poor go to jail in a country that imprisons more than any dictatorship - 5% of adult males are under ""correction"". Some 3,500 people await execution on death row; 580 have been executed since the Supreme Court lifted its ban.  This is not the portrait of a civilised modern state. We are deceived by history. We are deceived by the myriad   rainbow wonders of America, this mighty engine of invention and imagination, of creativity and enthusiasm from sea to shining sea. Europeans visit New York, San Francisco or Cape Cod, read the great American novelists and intellectuals, revel in America's popular culture, films and art and admire the super-sophistication of its academic discourse. It's rather like visiting St Petersburg before the revolution, wondering at the brilliance of Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov, Dostoevsky or maybe Faberg&eacute;, while trying to disregard the Tsar. The US constitution is kept on a mighty altar and lowered into a bomb-proof shelter at night as if it were indeed the guarantor of freedom: all it proves is that constitutions, freedoms of speech or information are only a small part of a good society. (The Soviet constitution was a pretty good document too.)  In elections there is always a better and worse. Bush is terrifying - in hock to oil and arms, promising a $1.3 trillion tax cut to the exclusive benefit of the top few. Gore is better.

The more we look at alien America, the more European we feel and the stronger we need to become.","John Major started it with his potty ""family values"" crusade. Thou shalt not fall into bed with the wrong woman and remain a member of my blokeish government. (Shurrup, Edwina!) But prime ministerial pottiness is ever with us. Who, doe-eyed and dripping sincerity, invited our trust - and made himself the ultimate repository of that virtue? Tony Blair. So who now lives or dies on the red line he created?Pause, though, for pottiness is a three-syllable word of some complexity. Major wasn't daft to go back to basics per se; he was crazy to let his moral musings turn into a kind of ministerial code of toe-sucking practice. The truth was then, is now and must indelibly remain that politicians are just ordinary men and women, people like us, people no better than we ought to be. Jawbone them about fornication to your heart's content, but don't make silly, rigid rules that will inevitably - in ordinary, lustful humanity - be broken. That's potty.And trust - after seven years of bitter examination - is just the same, a plastic plant plonked in a flowerpot from some Daily Mail Ideal Home exhibition. The modern Mail, remember, deals in absolutes. Absolute family harmony or perfidy? A Major-type choice. Complete trust in our leaders or another pile of overspun horse manure from Mendacity Inc? It's a phoney construction, but a hugely powerful one: and we've swallowed it hook, line and stinker.Of course politicians, for a while at least, revel in public trust. Leaders great or small always like the adoration of the led. But try injecting another dose of ordinary humanity into that argument.Trust is a relative, nuanced thing. You may or may not trust your neighbour to feed the cat while you're away. It depends on the neighbour. You may or may not tell the local police you're going on holiday. That depends on what happened last time you went to Majorca. Who trusts a boss in a pay negotiation who says he's run out of money on day two? Or a union leader who promises to pull down the pillars then settles behind the arras?Would I trust the present Archbishop of Canterbury to be strong, consistent and stalwart over gay bishops? I'd be a fool if I did. Or the Cantuar just past, peddling an autobiography, to stay mum about Charles and Camilla? Ditto. Or Andy Gilchrist to hang tough when the fires of fury burned too high? Ditto - or however they say that in Portuguese.Trust is a matter of individual judgment and experience. If you work in an office, look round and categorise the people at the next desks. (No: of course you've done that long since, the first of the necessary work skills learned, office politics.) So why on earth should trust in politicians or governments, in prime ministers themselves, come as a job lot of pretty packages? It's an utterly false dichotomy. It carves professional politics away from politics day-to-day and seeks to bathe it in an artificially kindly light.You may trust doctors, but not Harold Shipman. Academic publishers, but not Robert Maxwell. Presidents of the US, but not ... oh, forget it! Some of the time, out in the back garden smoking a surreptitious fag, you may not even trust yourself.The point - the critical point - about any blanket concept of trust is the way it creates a Daily Mail kind of world. They, those bigwigs over there, are the leaders, and we gave them our trust. We, us lot over here, have been lied to and traduced ever since, suckers, victims, neglected pawns. See: the construct assumes that we are fools, self-deluding, malleable idiots incapable of doing what we do naturally in everyday life - thinking, assessing, making our own choices.There's something convenient, in a fast-food sort of way, about that divide, of course. It means we never have to admit that we, personally, might have got an issue wrong. We were ""lied to"" over WMD, and so need never grow introspective about what we'd have done on the information then available. We marched and were spurned. Fine, but blamefests come too damn easy.Throughout Europe, eight days ago, politicians in power got a rare old roasting from electorates oozing distrust. Same here: we put our faith in Robert Kilroy-Silk, maybe because Jerry Springer wasn't standing. Last week in Brussels, Blair tried ""his cynical ploy"" of ""making as much fuss about a number of red lines as possible"" and ""keeping very quiet about the other issues he wasn't going to win"". How do I know that? Because the Mail's main European ""analyst"" told me before the essential bargaining had even started. Never let facts or contemporaneous reporting get in the way of received opinion.This isn't, you may be relieved to hear, yet another column arguing for or against Europe membership. Leave that for the relevant time. What it is, though, is a shivering apprehension of debates that matter conducted in gimcrack stereotypes to barely hidden agendas.The cry from core Labour now is still ""Trust Tony"" - with an anxious descant demanding to know whether Tony can ever regain such trust. Of course he can't. Such trust is a plastic plant in a plastic pot. It can't be summoned on demand or glued back together.But this trust is anyway a worthless commodity. Its manifest lack didn't wreck Lloyd George or SuperMac or the wizard called Wilson. Nobody gave it to Bill Clinton (though he was more poll popular when he left office than Ronald Reagan). Nobody in full sentience would dream of trusting Charlie Kennedy to tell the same story in Aberdeen and Penzance - or Michael Howard to explain why he sacked the head of the prison service. Too much ado about synthetic sincerity. Trust me, I'm not a politician."
1,"George W Bush appears to be on a near-vertical global learning curve. And it is not just him. In the past two weeks the world has been changing astonishingly quickly beneath our feet and commentators are running to keep up. It may turn out to be a temporary phenomenon, just erratic after-shocks before global business returns to normal. But a hurricane wind of change is in the air.<BR><BR> The prospect opens up that a whole logjam of territorial and ideological conflicts have been jolted into unblocking some rivers of progress - if this ends well, if the US stays fully engaged. All of us who stand watching and waiting for war, hearts in mouths, fearing cataclysm but hoping for success, need to be alert and ready to change. This is a time to park ideological shoes outside and be prepared to reassess all kinds of old id&eacute;es fixes, of right and left. (The shoes will still be there if the world disappointingly backslides behind old battlelines.) Start with the Bush phenomenon. This political pygmy fought a poisonous election campaign, a caricature of everything the outside world despises about greedy America. Once in power he was tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to impose NMD as a symbol of a US isolated under its exclusive umbrella - and to hell with the rest of the world. <BR><BR>World trade negotiations were one-sided, not a penny of US debt relief was paid as he pushed through $1.3 trillion tax cuts despite the need for health and schools. Drilling in Alaskan wildlife refuges, the oil man denying global warming and denouncing Kyoto: belching America didn't give a damn, that was the Bush global message. He didn't need to know the names of faraway countries because they didn't count.  But now suddenly they do. One after another the nations of the world joining a grand coalition have shown him how interconnected things are. Foreign peoples are now needed and their needs are interwoven with US interests in security, prosperity, trade and terrorism: no country, even the US, is an island after all. Globalisation works both ways.  Did we misunderestimate the man, to use his own misword? Probably not, but it hardly matters what is or isn't in his head, who pulls his strings, does the diplomacy or writes the speeches. What matters now is what he says and does. On the old Nixon-in-China principle, this man might direct the world towards peace better than some liberal president always fearful of redneck US opinion. So an open mind is required by all after his speech last week and the background briefings since. Astonishing things have been said and done. Short of the fall of the iron curtain, few world leaders have ever about-faced so fast.  One great jolt came when Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defence, mused last week that it would now be necessary for the US to construct an acceptable post-Kyoto strategy: that presumably is a message carried back from Europe, where Green parties share government. All over the world the quid pro quos are coming home to roost: America has had to change. Nothing is set in stone any more, everything is fluid. <BR><BR>Before September 11 there was a European way, largely social democratic, and an American way, largely conservative. British anti-Europeans clung to the US, the left looked to Europe and Tony Blair's bridge across the Atlantic looked like an irritating third way fudge. But those of us who saw the world that way have had to shift: in extremis, the cultural and political dividers between Europe and the US are second-order issues when compared to the Taliban and Bin Laden.  No doubt the day will come again when those issues loom large - but not now. As for the Eurosceptics, they have to swallow their old distaste in admiration for the coherence of Europe of which we are an integral part. In another remarkable global jolt there is Vladimir Putin offering airspace, airports and military aid in a joint Russian/US/EU anti-Taliban enterprise.  One more after-shock is the changed attitude to Israel. Bush said in his early days he would not bother with the peace process, but no more: Israel's best friends now look set to enforce it. Luckily it is a far-right Israeli government that will have to face the global reality of its situation, even if it did greet Jack Straw's mere mention of a Palestinian state as ""obscene"" and ""pornographic"". <BR><BR>But the message of Iran's return to the international fold and all those other Arab states offering positive support has to mean an imposed peace between Israel and Palestine sooner rather than later. It is the absolute sine qua non for calming Islamic fury against the west. Only an Israel residing strictly within its borders can secure long-term security from this new world coalition. <BR><BR>Until now the bloodied Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism could look the soft Americans in the eye and shame them. Now the Americans are bloodied too. As they send their men in to die fighting terrorism they have the moral right to tell the Israelis and the Palestinians that peace is the only game in town, for everyone's safety. Meanwhile Arab autocracies fester dangerously while propped up by the west, but they will not be democratised until the Israel/Palestine tragedy is cauterised.  Will the Afghan war be worth it? The government grumbles about the usual Phil Space articles with whizz-bang boys' comic maps of imaginary fighters zapping phantom Bin Laden hideouts, while the real war plans are secret to virtually all. Laptop brigadiers can only demand that it is quick, proportionate and does not knock down dominos of violence elsewhere. We cannot assess the odds of removing the Taliban, denying terrorists the water they swim in and keeping this coalition together afterwards to ease other long-standing grievances. But official language suggests the US knows that carpet-bombing atrocities would end the fragile coalition.  Pacifists are up in arms, an ever-necessary warning to war leaders not to make matters worse - but alternative plans to bomb the Taliban with food lack a certain conviction. Recent military interventions by the democratic world to impose freedoms have mainly had good outcomes, creating something better for proportionate casualties. Though each war provoked peace protests at the time, most Sierra Leoneans, Kuwaitis, Serbians and Kosovans are better off. So are the peoples of Croatia, East Timor and Argentina. Bosnia and Rwanda were lessons in favour of fighting, where mere peacekeeping permitted shameful massacres.  This time the Taliban are indisputably the vilest regime on earth, as well as lethally dangerous: the only unknown is the outcome. For now, old fixed attitudes towards the US and many other nations need to be suspended, waiting to see if many parts of the world really are undergoing fundamental recalibrations of old positions.","The land of the free now wields an absolute power, free of responsibility, such as the world has never known.

On the old Nixon-in-China principle, this man might direct the world towards peace better than some liberal president always fearful of redneck US opinion. So an open mind is required by all after his speech last week and the background briefings since. Astonishing things have been said and done. Short of the fall of the iron curtain, few world leaders have ever about-faced so fast.  One great jolt came when Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defence, mused last week that it would now be necessary for the US to construct an acceptable post-Kyoto strategy: that presumably is a message carried back from Europe, where Green parties share government. All over the world the quid pro quos are coming home to roost: America has had to change. Nothing is set in stone any more, everything is fluid. <BR><BR>Before September 11 there was a European way, largely social democratic, and an American way, largely conservative. British anti-Europeans clung to the US, the left looked to Europe and Tony Blair's bridge across the Atlantic looked like an irritating third way fudge. But those of us who saw the world that way have had to shift: in extremis, the cultural and political dividers between Europe and the US are second-order issues when compared to the Taliban and Bin Laden.  No doubt the day will come again when those issues loom large - but not now. As for the Eurosceptics, they have to swallow their old distaste in admiration for the coherence of Europe of which we are an integral part. In another remarkable global jolt there is Vladimir Putin offering airspace, airports and military aid in a joint Russian/US/EU anti-Taliban enterprise.  One more after-shock is the changed attitude to Israel. Bush said in his early days he would not bother with the peace process, but no more: Israel's best friends now look set to enforce it. Luckily it is a far-right Israeli government that will have to face the global reality of its situation, even if it did greet Jack Straw's mere mention of a Palestinian state as ""obscene"" and ""pornographic"". <BR><BR>But the message of Iran's return to the international fold and all those other Arab states offering positive support has to mean an imposed peace between Israel and Palestine sooner rather than later. It is the absolute sine qua non for calming Islamic fury against the west. Only an Israel residing strictly within its borders can secure long-term security from this new world coalition. <BR><BR>Until now the bloodied Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism could look the soft Americans in the eye and shame them. Now the Americans are bloodied too. As they send their men in to die fighting terrorism they have the moral right to tell the Israelis and the Palestinians that peace is the only game in town, for everyone's safety. Meanwhile Arab autocracies fester dangerously while propped up by the west, but they will not be democratised until the Israel/Palestine tragedy is cauterised.  Will the Afghan war be worth it? The government grumbles about the usual Phil Space articles with whizz-bang boys' comic maps of imaginary fighters zapping phantom Bin Laden hideouts, while the real war plans are secret to virtually all. Laptop brigadiers can only demand that it is quick, proportionate and does not knock down dominos of violence elsewhere. We cannot assess the odds of removing the Taliban, denying terrorists the water they swim in and keeping this coalition together afterwards to ease other long-standing grievances. But official language suggests the US knows that carpet-bombing atrocities would end the fragile coalition.  Pacifists are up in arms, an ever-necessary warning to war leaders not to make matters worse - but alternative plans to bomb the Taliban with food lack a certain conviction. Recent military interventions by the democratic world to impose freedoms have mainly had good outcomes, creating something better for proportionate casualties. Though each war provoked peace protests at the time, most Sierra Leoneans, Kuwaitis, Serbians and Kosovans are better off. So are the peoples of Croatia, East Timor and Argentina. Bosnia and Rwanda were lessons in favour of fighting, where mere peacekeeping permitted shameful massacres.  This time the Taliban are indisputably the vilest regime on earth, as well as lethally dangerous: the only unknown is the outcome. For now, old fixed attitudes towards the US and many other nations need to be suspended, waiting to see if many parts of the world really are undergoing fundamental recalibrations of old positions.","I know you should not judge by appearances, but 'Mrs B' doesn't look like a child killer. To use old-fashioned language, she is motherly - a plump, rosy-cheeked woman of Kent, whom nature seemed to have created to raise children. Kent social services soon put a stop to that. In 1999, Mrs B gave birth to a daughter. The child suffered fits that would have baffled previous generations of doctors, but which modern doctors could label with an impressively scientific name. Two concluded that Mrs B was poisoning the girl because she was an attention-seeker suffering from Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. First, they claimed she had fed her tranquillisers. There was no trace of tranquilliser in the child's blood, hair or urine. Then they claimed she had injected her with water from a flower bowl or lavatory. One of Britain's foremost toxicologists said the idea that either could have caused fits was nonsense. The family paediatrician said he found the allegations absurd. The evidence was so feeble the police didn't investigate. No matter. In 2003, the Family Division of the High Court, sitting in closed session, upheld the decision to take the girl from her mother and send her to live with relatives 200 miles away. Curiously, since the authorities had declared that Mrs B was an insane and depraved woman, the courts allowed her to keep her other two daughters. I don't know how to explain this - maybe it's a miracle - but they survive in rude health. The Family Division might have been designed to allow miscarriages of justice. Judges need only find the case against parents proven 'on the balance of probabilities' rather than 'beyond reasonable doubt'. Reasonable questioning of their decisions by outsiders is next to impossible because it is a contempt of court to reveal what has gone on. The formal reason for secrecy is that it prevents the media identifying children - and, undoubtedly, there are circumstances in which they need protecting. When there is an injustice, however, it is in the interests of parents and child for the mother to be able to exercise a free woman's right to make a fuss by going to the papers, local TV station, her councillors and MP. In normal circumstances, the law would have stymied Mrs B, but she had two strokes of luck. The first was that her solicitor was Sarah Harman. This case has come close to ruining Harman. The best part of the past 18 months has been the admiring tributes. At the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal last week, clients, judges and fellow solicitors spoke of a lawyer of the highest integrity who 'looks to right injustice wherever she finds it'. People who know her rely on her. After Michael Stone murdered Josie Russell's mother and sister, her father Shaun asked Harman to be Josie's trustee and protect her interests. If you need to smash your way through a brick wall, she is a good lawyer to have holding your coat. Mrs B was also fortunate that by 2003 politicians were belatedly realising that like many another secret world the Family Division was liable to be swept by pseudo-scientific manias. The spark for their concern was the quashing by the Court of Appeal of the convictions of Sally Clark, Angela Cannings and others allegedly driven mad by Munchausen's. The evidence of Professor Sir Roy Meadow which had sent them down for child killing was revealed to be tosh. It was not just his cockeyed testimony. The Court of Appeal wisely noticed that doctors were trying to identify illnesses that 'may be unexplained today [but] perfectly well understood tomorrow'. When medieval cartographers did not know what lay beyond the mountains they filled the blank spaces on their maps with 'There be dragons'. Much the same had happened in English law. When no one could explain injuries or illnesses, Meadow and his associates filled the blank spaces with pictures of monstrous women. Margaret Hodge, the Children's Minister, announced a review that was potentially more explosive than the Court of Appeal's verdicts. Whatever else Angela Cannings and Sally Clark had suffered, their friends and families could at least protest loudly and in public. Hodge was to look at 5,000 Family Division cases with disputed medical evidence where the courts had taken away children in secret. Well, thought Sarah Harman, if there's at last going to be a review I want my client's voice heard. She sent details of Mrs B's case to the local MP and to her sister Harriet Harman, the solicitor-general, who passed them to Hodge. Nothing they saw identified Mrs B's daughter. Mrs B also spoke to the Daily Mail and the BBC. Nothing was printed or broadcast which identified the girl. Closed systems hate daylight. Kent County Council went ape and claimed that Sarah Harman was in contempt of court for talking to politicians and the press. It was far from clear that she was. No other common law democracy imposes such restrictions on child care cases. Even in Scotland, what Sarah Harman had done would not have raised an eyebrow. Kent County Council itself discussed Mrs B with Roy Meadow, even though he was not a witness in the case. If Sarah Harman were guilty of contempt of court, so were its officers, presumably. Mr Justice Munby heard the argument. On one point all sides agreed: Sarah Harman was slow to disclose what she had done to the court. She had a good excuse. Her doctors had just told her she was suffering from cancer, and she had to endure two bouts of emergency surgery while she was fighting to defend her reputation. You might have forgiven her for being a touch confused. Munby didn't forgive and threw the book at her. She was in contempt of court and had misled the court, he declared. No one had the right to discuss a Family Division case with anyone - not with the Children's Minister or the solicitor-general or their MP. People talk about judicial activism, but this was judicial totalitarianism. Britain is a parliamentary democracy, but Munby was saying that citizens who brought their grievances to their elected representatives were in contempt of court. Harman had to pay &pound;20,000 in legal costs. The punishments didn't stop there. Last week the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal heard Kent County Council's complaint against Sarah Harman and banned her from practising law for three months. It is an ugly but typical picture of the legal establishment thumping critics when its faults are exposed. The backlash won't work and isn't working. Parliament reacted to Munby's treatment of Sarah Harman by changing the rules and giving citizens the right to discuss injustices. More reform is coming, albeit slowly and timorously. Even Mr Justice Munby told Parliament that he did not think 'the existing rules are necessary'. The old regime will die, but it is getting its pound of flesh before it goes. Sarah Harman has had her good name blackened and spent so many thousands of pounds defending herself that she has given up counting. I'm not saying all the 5,000 parents who had their children snatched were innocent. But the pathetic and frankly incredible review of their treatment found that in only one case - that's right, just one - did the Family Division get it wrong. Despite the scandal, despite the General Medical Council striking Meadow's name from the medical register, 'Mrs B' and 4,998 others are still being punished as child abusers. BBC1's adaptation of Bleak House continues at 4.10 this afternoon."
1,"The National Lottery plants its golden footprints up and down the land. And 12bn of good has been done so far: the Angel of the North spreads its iron wings, athletes hold gold medals aloft hailing the lottery that made them possible, the Eden project gleams within its glass domes, while hundreds of new community centres start thriving local activities. Decayed parks in towns everywhere are restored to Victorian municipal glory. A playgroup arises in an area with none. And, yes, asylum seekers get a little too.  But the lottery always had enemies. On the left puritans complain it is a regressive tax on the poor (though they don't propose banning Ladrokes). The moral right are uneasy at state-sponsored sin, but mainly loathe do-gooders. The result is sour sniping at everything the lottery does, emphasising the errors - the dome and the Churchill papers. But the latest war over grants to asylum seekers is doing real damage, destroying pride in its great benefits.   This is a story of folly and also of wickedness. Start with the folly: the Community Fund, one of the six boards distributing lottery largesse, gave money to the National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns (NCACD), a Birmingham group counselling asylum seekers on their rights, fighting deportations and getting many decisions successfully reversed. This is unpopular but necessary work: people should be helped to use what rights they have. They also campaign against the asylum laws, but that is not against charity law. All well and good. However, had the Community Fund glanced at the group's website, they would have found some wild, abusive stuff unbefitting lottery recipients. One group compared Bush to Hitler. The NCACD accused Blunkett of ""colluding with fascism"". Unwise.   When Blunkett learned of a relatively small story on page 5 in the Mail about this grant, he went nuclear. He could have picked up the telephone for a private word with Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary who oversees the lottery. Together they could have limited the damage quietly by calling the Community Fund and requesting them to ask the NCACD to clean up their language and their website. If the NCACD had two ounces of sense and hoped for future grants, it would have spontaneously issued a correction/apology and a polite press release describing the good work they do. But with the Mail on their doorstep, they were embattled.   What happened instead is that David Blunkett and his special adviser saw their chance for yet another of their regular nasty-story-for-the-Sundays slot. They constructed an inflammatory press release denouncing the grant. Tessa Jowell managed to get her hands on it in time and soften its language a bit, promising to review the grant. But Blunkett fanned the flames into a firestorm led by the Daily Mail, which day after day attacked the Community Fund with incendiary and racist ferocity. The Daily Mail gave a statement to Radio 4's World at One this week claiming that it was ""highlighting the activities of the Community Fund with the wholehearted support of the home secretary"". David Blunkett hotly denies this.   The Daily Mail's campaign against the Community Fund has on four days urged readers: ""Please vent your anger"" against Diana Brittan (wife of Sir Leon), head of the fund. Staff have been forced to open 4,000 abusive letters wearing gloves, since some contained excrement, reading ""I'm going to kill you"", ""fucking bitch"", ""fucking arsehole"" and more. The Midland office has had a bomb threat. Falkland's hero Simon Weston joined in with an anti-lottery diatribe at the Tory party conference, complaining veterans had been refused money. Why was he helping slaughter the golden goose, when his own charity, the Weston Spirit, has had 2m of lottery money with another three applications pending?    Not surprisingly, the fund went into meltdown and took too long to respond. Only 5% of its money goes to asylum seekers, 11% to ethnic minorities, and 5% to the third world, but yes, their remit is to give to less cuddly causes neglected by traditional giving. Their instructions are to fill the gaps, not follow popular sentiment. Any fund giving to smaller community groups makes some mistakes. One such was to give money to a man rescuing criminal youth from the streets: alas he was recruiting them to his own criminal gang. Was it the fund's fault? No. The man was an adviser to the police - if even the police didn't know, how could they?   Worse is to come. Next week it is likely the fund will be forced to announce that the NCACD grant will go ahead. Dearly though some might regret it, unless evidence emerges of law-breaking, the promised cash cannot be rescinded. Expect mushroom clouds. Camelot, itself is in trouble after the abysmal failure of their chief executive Diane Thompson's relaunch of new games, had the cheek last week to add petrol on the flames by claiming this asylum seekers' grant had cut lottery sales by 500,000 a week. (She said nothing about Camelot's own foundation's grants to asylum seekers). Camelot has yet to produce figures proving they are not disguising their own failures: Thompson's ""you'd be lucky to win a tenner"" Ratner remark, about the negligible chance of winning, didn't help.   Now every lottery hater has proclaimed the lottery undemocratic, demanding the right of lottery players to tick a box on their ticket to say where the money should go.   October 31 is the closing date for a public consultation on the lottery. Radical change is needed to repair its reputation, to make it trusted and loved. Jowell is seriously considering nationalisation: the fiasco of the last contract proved that no outsider can ever beat the incumbent. Where there is no competition, it would be wise to make it into a national institution, with no profits lost.   The six distribution boards will be amalgamated into one, with a single national lottery plaque emblazoned on every project that gets money, so people can see where the money is spent. Areas that have had too little funding - too deprived to apply - may get local referenda on how to spend lump sums. Democratic local citizens panels, (already in place for the Heritage Fund) may distribute money more accountably, gaining expertise as they go. When under fire, they would be better trusted to explain their spending decisions.   But big grants over 1m must still be taken centrally. It should not all flow to kittens and cancer at the behest of the tabloids. If the government gave in to pressure for tick boxes, it might temporarily stop tabloid insults about ""the liberal, lentil-chomping lefties who hand out Lotto cash"".   But granting funds at public whim would be a wicked abdication of the elected politicians' duty to see that all money is as wisely and justly spent as possible - give or take the odd inevitable mistake.","The ID-cards vote passed: however angry Labour MPs are at this succession of pointless provocations inflicted on them, there is sensible a limit to how much damage they will inflict on themselves. Plenty of them have much to fear in their own constituencies in this low season for Labour.Those who did spend a freezing wet weekend in Blackpool found the spring conference pretty dismal and dispiriting. It was planned as a rip-roaring celebration of Labour's glorious centenary, but few people came; there were few MPs, a smattering of ministers drafted in, and the press room was bare. Many constituency parties sent no delegates.The frail state of the grassroots was whispered often in the Winter Gardens. Hazel Blears and John Prescott, trying to bounce the party into a semblance of life with defibrillator jolts of demented optimism, rashly opined that parties which wither at the roots will die at the top. With most big cities lost and a massacre of remaining councils expected at the May elections, some constituency parties that have recently lost their MP, their council and most councillors are struggling to sustain the will to live. Now add in the Dunfermline result and it's not surprising that so few went to Blackpool. As the leadership interregnum drags on, it saps the blood of the party.Tony Blair turned in a below-par speech. But even belowpar and fading in power to convince, every time he steps up to a lectern he reminds them all of his political genius. It is the same in the Commons: he stands amid swelling backbench rebellion, yet on Wednesday mornings he can rouse his party to whooping glee as he lands punches on the bench opposite, reminding his own that they may miss him when he's gone. With all that vim and verve, no wonder he can't let go. So much still to do, so much to stop his successor doing.It is human instinct to clutch after immortality, leaving a footstep in the shifting sand. But political leaders crave it with unnatural passion. Blair is trying to force his legacy on to his successor, fixing Gordon Brown's feet in concrete into his own footsteps. The so-called ""dual prime minister"" scenario described by Charles Clarke looks more like the grizzly embrace of death, the dying man holding the future leader in a deadly grip with his last gasp.In this terminal phase, Brown has no option but to obey. So out he goes to bat for the ID cards he used to think wildly too expensive. In his speech yesterday on security, he even made a reasonable stab at pretending a pressing need for the ""glorification of terrorism"" clause, which virtually no one in the Commons believes. His speeches are taking a Churchillian turn as he reprises his Britishness theme, calling for ceremonies in every constituency for Veterans' Day and new cadet schemes to instil military discipline in state-school pupils. ""We will not yield, relax, rest, become complacent or lower our guard but will use every means, every necessary resource..."" and more, to fight terror.The daily taunts from the Tories (and some Blairites) that Brown will abandon ""reform"" to lead Labour back to its dark days of producer interests and union power seem to be hitting their mark. In response, no flag is big enough, no trumpet loud enough, no dead hero's memorial tall enough - Brown must add to their patriotic clamour.It may not gladden the hearts of those hoping that his premiership will herald renewal, optimism and progressive enthusiasm. Every time Brown parrots the need for ""reform, reform, reform"" as defined by Blair, spirits in the party sink a bit lower. But he has no choice. He is destined to follow Blair's footsteps every inch of the way - until the old leader finally departs and discovers that no prime minister can ever command the future beyond his time.All this tells us very little of what to expect when Brown's day finally comes. Expect no more than a tiny flash of the cardinal's red lining in what he says now. Whether once in power he will ever give more than the odd tantalising glimpse, it's hard to know. But for now he has no choice but tough talking. The success of New Labour was built on the ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"" slogan that Brown himself devised. Unless Labour can prove itself as patriotic, as ready to fight and as ready to punish wrongdoers as the Tories, it will lose, lose and lose again. True, Blair has taken this game into extreme overkill, fighting more wars and locking up more criminals than any other government. But no Labour leader can survive if they fail the ""toughness"" test.With Brown, more lies beneath the rhetoric. Everyone is for ""reform"": he hints that his might be of a different hue. Tucked into yesterday's tough speech on security was a balancing thoughtfulness on stronger democratic accountability and shoring up civil liberties, and a seriousness about rights, with radical constitutional proposals to come. There are layers of ideas wrapped inside his flag as he strives to reclaim patriotism and Britishness for the progressive cause. It sounds so counterintuitive and unconvincing to many Labour ears that it may be a hopeless task - but it does make him unassailable by the Tories. He promises more optimistic themes in speeches to follow - easing the hardship of the lives of those ""hardworking"" families so often extolled by politicians, with more to come on social justice, children and opportunity.But he can say little while cemented into the Blair footprints. Hints and briefings are not much to go on, leaving his party clutching at straws: some will point despairingly at Brown's ultra-caution, secretiveness and failure to castigate boardroom greed. The economic dysfunction caused by gross income inequality never draws a murmur of disapproval. Some doubters worry it will be more of the same, but without Blair's magic appeal to the middle classes.Just wait until he gets his freedom, say his supporters. There will be a cornucopia of surprises, an opening up of government in a style to confound his critics. Purpose, drive and dynamism will bring the renewal this party needs.Whichever it is to be, even those wary of Brown now join his enthusiasts in just wanting to get the waiting over. At Blackpool I stopped 15 local delegates in a row, including some Labour party stewards. That's hardly a significant sample, but every single one said unequivocally that Blair should go by the summer and let the party start again at the autumn conference. Until he goes this will remain a fractious party in a state of suspended animation."

Perhaps it was too many. For sure, these pieces contained their share of mis-spoken words and fragile judgments. But here was the big subject. It raised so many issues of global concern, from Euro-American relations, through all the Blair-Bush encounters, into the Middle East process, on to civil liberties. How to forestall and suppress global terrorism is the greatest of all contemporary challenges, subsuming many others about economic and territorial justice on a grand scale. I've tried to address them as a reporter and analyst, as much as an opinionated columnist. Independence Day, however, is the moment to note an unhappy trend. Discourse and relationships have narrowed not broadened in 10 months. There's a hardening of tone between Europe and America. I sense trenches being dug. In particular, it becomes ever more difficult to discuss these colossal problems, rife with potential for prudent scepticism, in words that don't call forth instant labelling as to their categoric loyalty or treason. At the beginning, President Bush stared at the world and said you are either with us or against us. Time hasn't worked any refinement of his message, rather the reverse. We are all anti-Americans now, unless we happen to be pro.  Each side has made its contribution to this starkness. The Europeans began it, with the voices that refused to address what had happened. A seam of vindictiveness exposed itself. Anti-American paranoia enjoyed its finest hour, in some quarters, at the hands of Mohammed Atta, the leader of the plane-bombers.  This lack of empathy, though no longer so pitiless, is still apparent in Europe. Despite the best efforts of some reporters, the European mind - which includes the British mind - recoils from what America has embraced. It does not understand the enormity of what happened not only to New York and Washington but to the psyche of a once invulnerable nation. Most of Europe still tends to take its own experience of terrorism as a reason to disdain Americans' over-reaction to their own taste of it, and I'm speaking of the citizens at least as much as the political leaders. Ultimately, there's a difference of caring and a want of rage.  This has led Europeans into some amnesiac generalisations. They speak about Americans without remembering history, or distinguishing between the people and the Bush regime. They overlook American generosity both as a world power - which nation was it that saved the world from German and Soviet tyranny? - and as a nation of open doors and open hearts. Though the government, even one with a mandate as doubtful as George Bush's, can be said to be acting for the people, it seems important to be as careful in vaporising about Americans as about, say, Jewish or black people. Ethnic monoliths are a curse at every level of humanity.  But some Americans are moving down the same slope. Europeans too are generalised into infamy by the east-coast zeitgeist. Europe has been smeared as generally anti-semitic, on the basis of a microscopic number of voters in two or three countries. Europe is stigmatised as wimpish if not cowardly, because it does not place the same faith as America in the military response to terrorism.  To some extent, each continent is reacting according to the facts of geo-politics. Lesser powers have always sparred with great ones, as jealousies collide. No formerly lesser power knows this better than America. In 1795, John Adams, on the brink of the presidency of a new country still suffering under the transatlantic yoke, wrote to his wife Abigail: ""I wish that misfortune and adversity could soften the temper and humiliate the insolence of John Bull. But he is not yet sufficiently humble. If I mistake not, it is the destiny of America one day to beat down his pride.""  Now that the beating is long done, Europeans have a problem that's acutely visible at this time. They may never be sufficiently humble, but they should at least be clear. Neither the most pro- nor the most anti-American European governments, including this one, are unambiguous about what they want America to do or be. Sometimes, as in the Middle East and Afghanistan, they want intervention of a certain kind. Other times, they rail against American interventionism as if it were an ideological disease. There is justice in the Pentagon's scorn for a continent that wants America to do the heavy lifting against terror, while it dithers on the side.  Americans also need to consider some unlearned lessons. In power politics, the present period cannot be characterised as one of their magnanimous phases. Donald Rumsfeld is as insolent as John Bull used to be. At the grass roots, the soil is even more acidulous than it was a little while ago. I judge from the email responses I've had, often in massive quantities, to some of those 22 columns, almost entirely from the US, where the Guardian website seems to be a must-read. While it's true that more anti-Bush voices are starting to surface, the vocal majority have become more inflexible, more righteous and more harshly scathing of European critics than they were at the turn of the year.  And now we hear their British echoes, from people drawn towards the same stark analysis. Iraq is being prepared for its role as this generation's Vietnam. Long before an invasion happens, adamancy is beginning to prevail. Positions about pre-emption are being pre-emptively demanded: will you be with us or against us, whatever we choose to do? The question is asked at dinner as well as at Camp David. To give the wrong answer is to face certain ignominy from one side or the other, for failing or passing a simplistic loyalty test on an issue no longer to be treated as amenable to honest argument.  It would be another simplistic error to think these attitudes can be reconciled. Good will is not enough to bury such visceral differences as exist on a familiar and lengthening list of issues. The continents are without doubt drifting apart. They have interests in common, but also interests around which America, as now led, has the power and the hardness to insist on non-negotiable policies that we can take or leave. There are few cosy solutions to anything much, which the allies in the old western alliance will any longer unanimously sign up to.  But it only demeans things further to pre-stigmatise all debate with the mark of ""anti-American"". Some Europeans deserve the label, but very few. Most want to share in a dialogue where they are listened to, especially when they disagree. The crisis is far, far too serious for its terms to be entirely coloured by that convenient, thought-killing smear. The US, I think, will do what it wants anyway. But I don't think it's anti-American to say so. The real anti-Americans - anti-worlders, in fact - are those who don't want a serious discussion."

""Copenhagen is the land of make-believe and fairytales,"" she said. ""Does the leader of the house have a favourite fairy tale?"" We groaned, silently, for we could guess what was coming. ""Could it be The Emperor's New Clothes? Is she The Little Robber Girl, or is she really the princess?"" Oh dear. Laugh? We almost started. A team of top French deconstructionists could have spent semesters on that question. The reference to the emperor's new clothes was, I suppose, something to do with the government thinking it had performed better than it had. Or that Gordon Brown was preening himself while wearing nothing but body hair and goose pimples. Who can say? I don't know which princess Ms McIntosh had in mind, since there are several. As for The Little Robber Girl, no doubt this was meant to evoke high taxes, yet the actual story is horrible, involving mass murder and hideous cruelty. It is the kind of tale that was probably read to kids who have gone on to coin millions with misery memoirs: ""Mommy chained me to the radiator, and Daddy read me The Little Robber Girl, every night."" Anyhow, Ms Harman was prepared, sort of. She leapt up and said: ""We could all learn a lesson from fairytales, which is that you need to avoid""  and here she waved frantically at the Tory front bench  ""the brothers Grimm!"" She kept on talking, but we couldn't hear. Labour MPs, who had been largely sitting in a grumpy and morose silence, suddenly erupted as if it were the funniest political barb every fired. They rolled round in fits of comedy delight, slapping their thighs and holding their stomachs as if afraid that the force of the laughter inside them might make them explode.

A good point, but it may be a bit late to worry about public disgust now.","The media couldn't have made a bigger pig's ear of the white phosphorus story. So, before moving on to the new revelations from Falluja, I would like to try to clear up the old ones. There is no hard evidence that white phosphorus was used against civilians. The claim was made in a documentary broadcast on the Italian network RAI, called Falluja: the Hidden Massacre. It claimed that the corpses in the pictures it ran ""showed strange injuries, some burnt to the bone, others with skin hanging from their flesh ... The faces have literally melted away, just like other parts of the body. The clothes are strangely intact."" These assertions were supported by a human-rights advocate who, it said, possessed ""a biology degree"".I, too, possess a biology degree, and I am as well qualified to determine someone's cause of death as I am to perform open-heart surgery. So I asked Chris Milroy, professor of forensic pathology at the University of Sheffield, to watch the film. He reported that ""nothing indicates to me that the bodies have been burnt"". They had turned black and lost their skin ""through decomposition"". We don't yet know how these people died.But there is hard evidence that white phosphorus was deployed as a weapon against combatants in Falluja. As this column revealed last Tuesday, US infantry officers confessed that they had used it to flush out insurgents. A Pentagon spokesman told the BBC that white phosphorus ""was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants"". He claimed ""it is not a chemical weapon. They are not outlawed or illegal."" This denial has been accepted by most of the mainstream media. UN conventions, the Times said, ""ban its use on civilian but not military targets"". But the word ""civilian"" does not occur in the chemical weapons convention. The use of the toxic properties of a chemical as a weapon is illegal, whoever the target is.The Pentagon argues that white phosphorus burns people, rather than poisoning them, and is covered only by the protocol on incendiary weapons, which the US has not signed. But white phosphorus is both incendiary and toxic. The gas it produces attacks the mucous membranes, the eyes and the lungs. As Peter Kaiser of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told the BBC last week: ""If ... the toxic properties of white phosphorus, the caustic properties, are specifically intended to be used as a weapon, that of course is prohibited, because ... any chemicals used against humans or animals that cause harm or death through the toxic properties of the chemical are considered chemical weapons.""The US army knows that its use as a weapon is illegal. In the Battle Book, published by the US Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, my correspondent David Traynier found the following sentence: ""It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets.""Last night the blogger Gabriele Zamparini found a declassified document from the US department of defence, dated April 1991, and titled ""Possible use of phosphorus chemical"". ""During the brutal crackdown that followed the Kurdish uprising,"" it alleges, ""Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam may have possibly used white phosphorus (WP) chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels and the populace in Erbil ... and Dohuk provinces, Iraq. The WP chemical was delivered by artillery rounds and helicopter gunships ... These reports of possible WP chemical weapon attacks spread quickly ... hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled from these two areas."" The Pentagon is in no doubt, in other words, that white phosphorus is an illegal chemical weapon.The insurgents, of course, would be just as dead today if they were killed by other means. So does it matter if chemical weapons were mixed with other munitions? It does. Anyone who has seen those photos of the lines of blind veterans at the remembrance services for the first world war will surely understand the point of international law, and the dangers of undermining it.But we shouldn't forget that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime within a war crime within a war crime. Both the invasion of Iraq and the assault on Falluja were illegal acts of aggression. Before attacking the city, the marines stopped men ""of fighting age"" from leaving. Many women and children stayed: the Guardian's correspondent estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians were left. The marines treated Falluja as if its only inhabitants were fighters. They levelled thousands of buildings, illegally denied access to the Iraqi Red Crescent and, according to the UN's special rapporteur, used ""hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population"".I have been reading accounts of the assault published in the Marine Corps Gazette. The soldiers appear to have believed everything the US government told them. One article claims that ""the absence of civilians meant the marines could employ blast weapons prior to entering houses that had become pillboxes, not homes"". Another said that ""there were less than 500 civilians remaining in the city"". It continued: ""The heroics [of the marines] will be the subject of many articles and books ... The real key to this tactical victory rested in the spirit of the warriors who courageously fought the battle. They deserve all of the credit for liberating Falluja.""But buried in this hogwash is a grave revelation. An assault weapon the marines were using had been armed with warheads containing ""about 35% thermobaric novel explosive (NE) and 65% standard high explosive"". They deployed it ""to cause the roof to collapse and crush the insurgents fortified inside interior rooms"". It was used repeatedly: ""The expenditure of explosives clearing houses was enormous.""The marines can scarcely deny that they know what these weapons do. An article published in the Gazette in 2000 details the effects of their use by the Russians in Grozny. Thermobaric, or ""fuel-air"" weapons, it says, form a cloud of volatile gases or finely powdered explosives. ""This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area. The lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure ... Personnel under the cloud are literally crushed to death. Outside the cloud area, the blast wave travels at some 3,000 metres per second ... As a result, a fuel-air explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without residual radiation ... Those personnel caught directly under the aerosol cloud will die from the flame or overpressure. For those on the periphery of the strike, the injuries can be severe. Burns, broken bones, contusions from flying debris and blindness may result. Further, the crushing injuries from the overpressure can create air embolism within blood vessels, concussions, multiple internal haemorrhages in the liver and spleen, collapsed lungs, rupture of the eardrums and displacement of the eyes from their sockets."" It is hard to see how you could use these weapons in Falluja without killing civilians.This looks to me like a convincing explanation of the damage done to Falluja, a city in which between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians might have been taking refuge. It could also explain the civilian casualties shown in the film. So the question has now widened: is there any crime the coalition forces have not committed in Iraq? www.monbiot.com"

Civilians fled for cover as Alan Clark raged that the United States Air Force had ""an abominable record, hitting Iranian airliners, British forces, bridges, trains, factories and now refugee convoys . . . it is the worst possible implement to use''.

But Mr Clark positively cosied up to the USAF compared to the Downing Street press secretary, Alastair Campbell, ""who has gone to Brussels to put a spin on things. But you cannot spin a war. He would be better advised to stay coaching the prime minister,"" (Mr Clark curled his lip, and when he curls his lip it stays curled, as if he'd inserted Eva Braun heated rollers there) ""whose sole present practice is to wave his hands about and say 'Milosevic' all the time.""

Yet in spite of all this rage, yesterday's debate on Kosovo was grim, unhysterical, and deeply anxious. Often there was an eerie quiet in the chamber , as if no one else was present except the member speaking.

There were no cheers, except for the ritual praise for our armed forces; equally, there was no jeering or scorn. You could sense a certain unease when the isolationists and the pacifists spoke, but this reflected less disagreement with what they said than a mild rancour that anyone could claim with such certainty that they knew what was for the best.

The mood was the opposite of tub-thumping: it was tub-tapping; rabble-soothing, sabre-sheathing, calming and not hortatory.

The foreign secretary began. He was as optimistic as the circumstances currently permit. The campaign had made a ""real impact on President Milosevic's war machine''. (Unlike John Prescott, Mr Cook knows exactly how to pronounce it. He just swallows it whole, like a bad oyster, so it emerges as ""Mlos""'.)

Serbian commanders were having trouble keeping in touch with HQ because of the bombing. Loss of oil reserves meant that `officers have to watch the fuel gauge with increasing worry'', he said, making them sound like Allegro drivers who had forgotten to fill up on Christmas Eve.

Milosevic's tanks are now in hiding from our planes. Serb reservists are refusing the call-up. Around the world, other nations applaud us.

All of this should have been a cause for rejoicing, yet nobody at all rejoiced. Mr Cook stood grasping the dispatch box, one leg and a beard jutting fiercely forward, being heard in something near to silence. This must be the least jingoistic war Britain has ever been engaged in.

MPs are by now way ahead of the government in recognising that a ground war will be essential if Nato is to succeed. Nicholas Soames, Martin Bell  all those who spoke with authority assumed the use of land troops, and the need to prepare public opinion for the inevitable losses.

The most unusual suggestion came from Gwynneth Dunwoody who revealed that as a little girl, she had been taken for tea with Marshal Tito. The thought of Ms Dunwoody as a little girl was bewildering enough. ""Tito told us that when the Germans arrived, the Serbs were largely unarmed, so they put dinner plates on the road. When the very precise Germans got out to look, they were shot, and the Serbs had a tank.""

I'll bet Nato hasn't thought of the dinner plate option. That's why the Greeks are thought of as the weak link in the alliance  they'd want to smash them before they could be used."

The Labour front bench collapsed in laughter. There is little love lost there.","There used to be a game at particularly drunken 1930s house parties - I must have read this in PG Wodehouse - in which one person would leave the room and the remaining guests then tried to remember who it was. Even the most sober reader, though, may have difficulty calling to mind the present US ambassador's name. The explanation is simple, however. There isn't one. America has not had an ambassador here for five months. Not that, in recent years, you would have been much the wiser if there had been. Britain may be Washington's most devoted ally, and the London posting may be one of the most prestigious in the American foreign service, but the last US ambassador in London, William Farish, was so low profile that most people here were unaware of his presence or his departure.  Ambassador Farish was not the first envoy to get his job for services rendered - he was for years the Bush family's private banker - and he will doubtless not be the last. But the point was not that he was a political appointment rather than a career diplomat. It was that he was the original silent envoy, and his anonymity - save in bloodstock circles - came at a heavy political price.  It meant that, throughout one of the most demanding periods of modern transatlantic relations, America lacked a strong voice and presence on this side of the water. This was a double deprivation. It was a loss to Britain, since it left Tony Blair to take all the hits while attempting to mediate US policy in this country. And it was a loss to the US, because there was no one with the clout to mediate Britain's views back to the American administration and people.  You could argue, as some do, that in the networked world of the 21st century, ambassadors are not as important as they once were. And you would be right. Obviously when Blair and George Bush can do a video conference any time they choose, then the once decisive role of the ambassador is clearly diminished.  But this is also to underestimate the role, especially in the modern media world. An accomplished communicator, constantly absorbing and sensitive to a foreign country's mood on a daily basis, is an immense proactive asset for any nation. At its best, it means being able to participate in and influence opinion - having someone to go on the Today programme in the morning, to respond to the newspapers during the day, and to go on Newsnight at the end of the evening.  Above all, though, it means being a nation's dialoguer-in-chief, putting the case not just with the politicians but with the people. Britain's most recent ambassadors in Washington - Christopher Meyer and David Manning - have both been good at this. Many London embassies, including the French and the German, currently have ambassadors who can do it too.  But the Americans, infinitely more important, don't. That absence leaves a vacuum. Ambassador Farish's invisibility meant that most of the British public got its take on American policy from news footage of Bush and Donald Rumsfeld speaking in American ways to American audiences. Or else, since our broadcasters like attention-seekers, they got it hyped up by ideological provocateurs such as Richard Perle or Frank Gaffney.  What explains this deliberate absence from public debate? Is this because American diplomats are now so sealed off that they just don't get it? Or that they have calculated that it is simply not worth the aggravation? Or is it, as one reading of Condoleezza Rice's move to the state department has it, that the Rhett Butler view of the world - ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" - now rules across Washington, from Pennsylvania Avenue to Foggy Bottom?  Whatever the explanation, America is wrong not to have a more positive strategy for dialogue with the peoples of other nations, a strategy in which embassies would be bound to play a crucial part. Whatever conclusion one draws about the Iraq war has to include the fact that it constituted an overall failure of US diplomacy. Put the blame where you choose - with America and its allies or with America's opponents, or share it round - but the failure is unresolved business. You only have to look at opinion polls round the world to see that. Anti-Americanism has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished. But this will not happen without working at it.  There are very few signs anywhere in Europe that Bush's re-election is encouraging an outbreak of pragmatism. Perhaps in Germany, and to some extent in Spain. But not in France, and not in this country either. The readiness of some, happily only a few, to talk down the democratic revolution in Ukraine because it is supported by the US is ultimately more of a problem for those who think this way than for anyone else. But it is indicative of the poisonous nature of the wider problem facing the US, and that poison ought to be drawn.  So we should welcome two recent signs that the American embassy here is beginning to be concerned about the tone of some of the allegations levelled against its country. On November 26, as Naomi Klein described on these pages last Saturday, the London embassy indignantly challenged her claim that the US was fighting a war directed at Iraqi civilians and was ""eliminating"" witnesses of its policy, notably journalists, doctors and clerics. The same week, David T Johnson, the US charge d'affaires in London, wrote a letter published here on November 27 defending American support for democracy in Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern Europe in the face of an article headlined ""US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev"".  Both these responses were overdue in their own right. The one to Klein over Iraq was necessary because of the exceptional seriousness of the charges she is making, while that on Ukraine was a politically important rebuttal of the ""my enemy's enemy is my friend"" syndrome that has eaten into some anti-American responses to the scenes in Kiev. But the embassy's engagement is also something else: a recognition that the state department believes things have gone too far. Not before time, some might say.  It would be naive to say that the administration's foreign policy problems will be solved merely by international dialogue, still more to imply that the appointment of a top communicator to head each of the US's major embassies would achieve that goal. But these problems will certainly not be resolved without dialogue and better communicators. And unless the US raises its game, it will simply allow others to make the running.

That's why the Greeks are thought of as the weak link in the alliance  they'd want to smash them before they could be used.","It was our first chance to see David Miliband in action after Hillary Clinton's confession of  if not love, then of a deep and profound attraction. In an interview with American Vogue, the US secretary of state came over all Mills &amp; Boon. ""If you saw him,"" she said, ""it would be a big crush. I mean, he is so vibrant, vital, attractive, smart! He's a really good guy, and he's so young!"" You can say that again. The foreign secretary is 18 years her junior. That makes her what is known these days as a ""cougar"", an older woman who preys on younger men. (I think I know the origin of this curious term, but it isn't very nice, and I would not dare repeat it in the Guardian.) So Mr Miliband must feel a lot more welcome in Foggy Bottom, Washington, than he does in the Commons. The only woman facing him in the chamber today was Anne Main (C, St Albans) and she is a mere seven years older than him. A puma perhaps, or a lynx. And in any case she didn't exactly look smitten. Nor did Sir Peter Tapsell, the Man Who Warned the World About Afghanistan. He too was clearly not suffering from a crush. As Mr Miliband spoke, Sir Peter's expression ranged from sceptical to cynical, from disbelief to scorn. Finally he rose to intervene with a pair of questions designed to upend our deliciously vibrant foreign secretary through his own superior knowledge of the North-West Frontier and associated hell holes. We learned how the Taliban were once supported only by the Pashtun. Now they were being driven into the Swat Valley and Baluchistan! You could almost see that vital, smart brain thinking: ""I've heard of them. They were on the news!"" But he thought too soon. Sir Peter, never to be out-manoeuvred in the Great Game went on, ""which are an immense distance away from the Durand frontier!"" What possible answer can there be to that? It was a magnificent example of one-upmanship, a meeting between Stephen Potter, Flashman and Google Earth. Mr Miliband had no reply, and moved swiftly on to the Israel/Palestine question and something he called ""the Clinton parameters"". Well, I thought, I've never heard them called that before. It turned out that he was referring to the gorgeous, pouting Hillary's husband, who showed the world his parameters back in 2000. Disappointing. Then William Hague rose and enjoyed himself hugely over the appointment of ""Cathy Ashton"", as  he claimed  Gordon Brown's third choice as EU high representative. Why, he said, the foreign secretary had been tempted by the job, for all the right reasons including ""his belief that the prime minister will soon be gone"". Peter Mandelson had also been put forward. Ministers would have a chance to deny this, but instead ""an icy stillness"" rose from the front bench. This would not just be a case of a rat leaving the sinking ship, but the lord high admiral himself departing  ""though we are reluctant to suggest new titles, because he might adopt them"". The Labour front bench collapsed in laughter. There is little love lost there."

I'll bet Nato hasn't thought of the dinner plate option. That's why the Greeks are thought of as the weak link in the alliance  they'd want to smash them before they could be used.","Nick Raynsford's alibi is unchallengeable. The minister was not trying to cover up his decision to allow a unique listed building in Oxford to be moved, to make way for a business school funded by the arms broker Wafic Said. He had failed to inform the local MP simply because he was away in Egypt, leading a trade mission.  It's still not clear why the government refused to examine an application to dismantle one of the country's most important industrial monuments, or why the prime minister's office felt compelled to intervene in such a trivial matter as the timing of a planning decision. But the most interesting question has yet to be asked: what was the British planning minister doing on a trade delegation to Egypt? The answer suggests that Mr Raynsford's alibi is rather more heinous than the alleged crime.   Mr Raynsford was leading a delegation of 27 corporations. Among them were some of the most controversial multinationals stationed in this country: Balfour Beatty, Enron, Laing, Mott MacDonald, Thames Water and WS Atkins. The projects they visited included Egypt's most contested development scheme: the $90bn Toshka programme to divert the Nile. Environmentalists warn that it will devastate the river's ecology, financial consultants warn that it will have a similar impact on the country's economy. It's the sort of scheme, in other words, which, were it to have been proposed in Britain, should have been subject to the fiercest scrutiny by planning officials at the Department of the Environment (DoE), overseen by Mr Raynsford.   Interestingly, the major beneficiary of the trade mission appears to have been not a British company, but a Norwegian one. Soon after the tour, Kvaerner revealed that it had landed a 266m contract to build a pumping system at Toshka. Kvaerner's otherwise inexplicable presence on a British trade tour might have had something to do with the fact that it had seconded more of its employees into the DoE than any other company.   So why was Mr Raynsford, rather than a minister from the Department of Trade and Industry, helping these companies to sell their wares in Egypt? Well, Nick Raynsford has a curious double role. He is minister for planning, which means he is the regulator of development in Britain. But he is also minister for construction, which means he is the promoter of development in Britain. He routinely resolves this conflict of interests in favour of the industry he's supposed be regulating.   Mr Raynsford has gone to some lengths to show construction companies whose side he is on. ""I see my job,"" he told Building magazine, as ""creating a climate in   which the industry can do well."" To this end, his division has sought repeatedly to undermine government policy. It has sponsored, for example, a public relations offensive for the quarrying industry called Minerals 98. One of its purposes was to help companies lobby against the tax on roadstone that another division of the environment department had proposed.   At Labour's 1998 local government conference, Mr Raynsford argued against the environment department's plans for a tax on out-of-town parking places and in support of the superstores' objections to them. He has promised the British Council of Shopping Centres that he will seek to speed up major new retail schemes. Last week, he undermined the government's commitments on climate change by watering down the rules on energy efficiency in new homes, arguing that the standards were ""an undue burden on builders"".   But perhaps most alarming is his alleged role in the debate about the Ilisu dam in Turkey: the devastating ethnic cleansing project that will drive 78,000 Kurds out of their cultural heartland. It was Mr Raynsford, according to Whitehall sources, who persuaded Tony Blair to back the project. Why should he have done so? Well, in September 1999 he led a trade mission to Turkey. The consortium he accompanied was seeking to land 4bn-worth of contracts for rebuilding after the earthquake. The consortium was fronted by Balfour Beatty, which also happens to be the firm hoping to build the Ilisu dam. Three months later, the British government announced that it was ""minded to grant"" export credit for the Ilisu scheme. Is it possible that Mr Raynsford was told by the Turkish government that British rebuilding contracts were conditional on support for the dam?   The real scandal surrounding the Oxford business school is that everything Mr Raynsford says about it is probably true. There were no peculiar measures taken to approve the development; there was nothing unusual about the government's decision not to review the case. Decisions to turn a blind eye to the destruction of our heritage and environment are taken on behalf of the construction industry every week, by the man who is supposed to be policing it."
1,"A great PM's questions. But first, a moment in British constitutional history. On Tuesday I reported that Sir Peter Tapsell, one of the last knights of the shires, had been reselected. That morning, another thunderously grand knight, Sir Patrick Cormack, announced he would not be standing again. I am told these two events are closely connected. Both men were desperate to become father of the house. But now it seems almost certain that Sir Peter (known as ""Blofeld"" on the Labour benches) will succeed. For Sir Patrick this is a devastating time, and all our thoughts are with him. He sat behind his rival, in easy backstabbing distance, but being the ultimate gentleman, Sir Patrick refused to take advantage. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and David Cameron were knocking seven bells out of each other. The Tory leader wanted to know why Britain was the only G20 country still in recession. Gordon Brown made a mistake. He said that Spain was in recession, and six other EU members were too. I assume he meant Latvia, Bulgaria, etc. This is like saying,: ""No, I am not the stupidest boy in the class. Snotty Wilson got one less than me in maths."" It is better left unsaid. He went on to say Cameron was ""talking down Britain"". This is always a sign of the end. John Major used the line in the dying days of his government. Any criticism was ""talking down Britain"". It was weedy then and it's weedy now. Cameron riposted that Brown had promised we would ""lead the world out of recession"". Brown did what he always does, and accused the Tories of having no policies. The sound in the chamber grew louder and louder as he shot: ""The voice might be that of a modern PR man, but the mindset is the 1930s!"" ""That must have sounded great in the bunker!"" snapped Cameron. Brown fought back with his trusty if rusted old sword, the Tory policy of raising the inheritance tax threshold  for, he usually adds, the rich people on Cameron's Christmas card list. This time Cameron was ready. The Labour party was the only party which had already legislated for an increase in the inheritance tax!  Brown wriggled  for him, quite deftly. He brought up the fact that the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith was a multimillionaire who paid no British tax on his offshore income. Clearly he and Cameron had dreamed up inheritance tax policy on ""the playing fields of Eton"". The battle of pre-cooked, boil-in-the-bag soundbites was getting nastier. A Labour MP raised domestic violence. The actor Reese Witherspoon had spoken about it that morning. Mr Brown paid tribute to ""Renny Wutherspoon"". Scottish readers: don't hesitate to tell me this is the way it's pronounced in east Scotland, you English bigot! Witherspoon once played the wife  of Johnny Cash. Or, as Labour MPs would sing, ""Because you're mine/I toe the line"". Finally, Sir Peter Tapsell was called. All sides gave him an immense cheer. The prime minister had said that there would soon be 300,000 troops fighting in Afghanistan, the same number as the Soviets who were humiliated there. Should the prime minister not RESIGN? (Or as Sir Peter, who has a slight speech impediment, put it, ""WESIGN!"")","There are times in the Commons when the only tolerable response is to throw food. Sadly this is not allowed. Nor may we shout at MPs from the public and press galleries. Otherwise we'd be constantly yelling ""Next!"", or as they would say in the comedy clubs, ""Taxi for the minister!"" The urge to interrupt the proceedings is often strongest when members are trying to be funny. This is usually like watching a walrus attempting to tap-dance: you admire the effort rather than the result. Today Harriet Harman, leader of the house, was standing in for Gordon Brown who was at the climate change conference in Copenhagen. Anne McIntosh, the Tory MP for Vale of York, saw her chance. ""Copenhagen is the land of make-believe and fairytales,"" she said. ""Does the leader of the house have a favourite fairy tale?"" We groaned, silently, for we could guess what was coming. ""Could it be The Emperor's New Clothes? Is she The Little Robber Girl, or is she really the princess?"" Oh dear. Laugh? We almost started. A team of top French deconstructionists could have spent semesters on that question. The reference to the emperor's new clothes was, I suppose, something to do with the government thinking it had performed better than it had. Or that Gordon Brown was preening himself while wearing nothing but body hair and goose pimples. Who can say? I don't know which princess Ms McIntosh had in mind, since there are several. As for The Little Robber Girl, no doubt this was meant to evoke high taxes, yet the actual story is horrible, involving mass murder and hideous cruelty. It is the kind of tale that was probably read to kids who have gone on to coin millions with misery memoirs: ""Mommy chained me to the radiator, and Daddy read me The Little Robber Girl, every night."" Anyhow, Ms Harman was prepared, sort of. She leapt up and said: ""We could all learn a lesson from fairytales, which is that you need to avoid""  and here she waved frantically at the Tory front bench  ""the brothers Grimm!"" She kept on talking, but we couldn't hear. Labour MPs, who had been largely sitting in a grumpy and morose silence, suddenly erupted as if it were the funniest political barb every fired. They rolled round in fits of comedy delight, slapping their thighs and holding their stomachs as if afraid that the force of the laughter inside them might make them explode. I began to suspect that the noise had little to do with the quality of Hattie's joke but the fact that she had made it  and had said something brief and crisp in contrast to the endless vague rambling she had offered before. The row did not stop: it grew more raucous, and in the end the Speaker had to intervene. Good humour was one thing, disorder another, he said. The public wanted to be reassured, not disgusted. A good point, but it may be a bit late to worry about public disgust now."

(Or as Sir Peter, who has a slight speech impediment, put it, ""WESIGN!"")","The oldest saw in modern politics is that elections are won only on the centre ground. Extremists have to abandon, or at any rate disguise, their passions, and move to positions as close to being all things to all fickle voters as they can invent. That's how Tony Blair made Labour electable. The coalitions of continental Europe are built round the same inescapable proposition. In such politics, nuance replaces conviction, and manoeuvre boldness, as the identifying marks of a winning team. What's going on in America as the 2004 election begins is unnervingly the opposite. It's one of the more extraordinary spectacles a political scientist, or journalist, let alone a professional politician, could encounter. George Bush is running his campaign from the same fringe position as the one he has adopted for his presidency.  This is a hard-right administration offering virtually no concessions to the soothing niceties that might make it more electorally attractive to voters who are not Republicans. Its tax policy is grotesquely loaded against the masses and in favour of the rich. Its bias on the environment unfailingly comes out on the side of the big commercial interests. It is daily tearing up tracts of policy and practice that protected the basic rights of people snared in the justice system. It is the hardest right administration since Herbert Hoover's from a very different era. And, which is the point, delights in being so. There is no apology or cover-up.  But even that isn't the most striking thing about the set-up as it now stands. For this we have to turn to the Democrats. Unlike Bush, many Democrats are sticking to the conventional wisdom. They grope for some kind of centre ground. But so far has the territory shifted, thanks to the Republicans' shameless stakeout on the hard right, that their quest continues to drain their party of most of its meaning and any of its capacity to inspire.  The rules are being observed, but we find that in some circumstances these rules are a fallacy. They draw a party so far into the orbit of its rival as to render itself meaningless as anything except a political machine of variable potency around the country. Yet the dominant mode of most presidential candidates is still to cling to the kind of centrism that defines them at best as Bush-lite, at worst as people who have nothing to say that could send the smallest shiver up the spine of afloating voter.  One should hesitate to second-guess all these massively professional politicians, laden with polls. But their reflex looks to me as unnecessary as it is self-destructive. One way to respond to Bush's rewrite of the rule book - which covers more contentious ground than Ronald Reagan's campaigns ever did, for example - may be to meekly accept the new setting for old maxims. The other is to treat the maxims, in present times, as a snare.   For one thing, many Democrats seem to have forgotten that they did win the election last time. For four years it has been idle to challenge the Florida vote and the bizarre workings of the electoral college, but now is the time to recall that in 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore's progressive version of the future than Bush's more conservative one. Bush was still posing as a bit centrist then, and Gore was scarcely a raving liberal. Gore mostly stuck to the Clinton third way doctrine that had taken the Democrats away from the narrowest version of their past. But there was a left-right choice, and more Americans voted left than right.  In most systems, that would have been another reason for the technical winners to gravitate towards the centre. Since that did not happen, it is instead an excellent reason for the losers to rediscover their raison d'tre. Yet most of them seem mesmerised with terror at the prospect, and full of guff about Democratic ""values"" which they take to excuse them from advancing any awkward Democratic policies.  The Iraq war is to blame for this, but only partly. It is Bush's alibi for everything   else. To the extent that voters dislike his right-wingery on domestic matters, Iraq and terrorism give cover to the Great Leader. We may be sure he will exploit this until the day of the election. It puts Democrats in a bind, though something has changed when dreary Joe Lieberman, an early war supporter, now feels it necessary to bleat defensively that his was a ""principled"" position, and posturing John Kerry - probably the favourite as things stand - calibrates a position edging finely away from believer to mealy-mouthed critic. Another year of Baghdad body bags, with Osama bin Laden still at large, and the politics of the war cannot be so neatly predicted.  For any Democrat to take advantage of Bush's waning popularity and overcome his vast campaign finances, however, he must have something to say. There needs to be some clarity, on all fronts. The other day, the same edition of the New York Times carried stories saying that neither young African-Americans nor the Boston Irish could any longer be counted on as part of the core vote. Is this heresy surprising when nobody knows with any certainty what Democrats stand for? If a party can't fire up its core vote, it will be deader quicker than if it can't draw in people who've never voted for it before. Watching what Bush has done to both the economy and the constitution, it should be easy for a Democrat to come up with soundbites and articles of simple faith to inspire a few more than the millions of Americans who voted for Gore last time.  Wiseacres continue to pretend otherwise. They think Howard Dean, the most lefty of the candidates, and former governor of the state of Vermont, could never get elected. Transfixed by the attractions of triangulated centrism, they're prepared to have its geometry laid out exclusively by their opponents. They come out against a bit of the Bush tax plan but not all of it. They're all but silent, as are much of the media, on what anti-terrorism psychosis is doing to civil liberties.  Yet the Republicans didn't get where they are today by such half-baked timidity. The challenge they make is for the life and death of the soul of the America very many Americans still believe in. What their opponents need is a leader whose voice rings more eloquently than Bush's - surely not the hardest contest to win. That won't happen until they abandon their backing and filling, and their belief that being a Democrat no longer adds up to anything more than a milder version of their enemies.  ""Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice ... Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" Barry Goldwater said that 40 years ago. It was the start of the recovery of the right. The words now belong rather exactly in the other side's mouth. If they came out of Senator Kerry's this autumn, they'd make him sound less like a calculating wimp."
1,"Whatever the truth of Naomi Wolf's sex-pest accusations against Harold Bloom, nobody, so far, is coming out of the business very well. Wolf picked a funny old time to come out with this charge - not within the two years that charges can be investigated by the authorities; some considerable time after she had made suggestions of harassment on a public forum, though refused to name names (owing to the ""soft spot of complicity"" in her soul); two full decades after the event itself. Bloom has declined to comment, using instead the ""a friend says..."" avenue (the friend, incidentally, has denounced this as a vicious lie), which I always find a bit lame. Sundry other commentators have unleashed a weird level of spite, specifi cally Camille Paglia, who raged: ""It really grates on me that Naomi Wolf for her entire life has been batting her eyes and bobbing her boobs in the face of men and made a profession out of courting male attention.""  An assessment of that kind has to be based upon pretty close personal intimacy - in other words, Paglia needs to have observed Wolf exhibiting that behaviour, at close range and over a period of years. Otherwise, all she's saying is: ""This woman is pretty, and that disqualifies her from reasoned thought.""  I'd also, in the interests of perfect clarity, conduct some research into how transfixed men really are by boobs that bob, but never mind that for the time being. This vitriol is, without question, disproportionate. Had Wolf written an essay claiming that, while at Yale, a professor or student stole from her, hit her over the head with a chair, involved her in a pyramid scheme that was really a scam, or perpetrated any crime at all against her that didn't involve sex, the response would have been different. There might have been some puzzlement that she'd left it so long. There would have been people who questioned her veracity or, at the very least, were prepared to withhold judgment until greater evidence could be provided than the word of the accuser. But there wouldn't be anything like this fury that gushes out like a geyser whenever a woman, especially so tardily, makes a charge of sexual assault, be she an academic or 'er off Shooting Stars (Ulrika Jonsson, I mean). And it almost always comes from other women, handily, if bizarrely uniting feminists, post-feminists, non-feminists and the undecided, in a single voice of unsisterly incandescence. Why should the response be so vehement? What is it about sex crimes, or charges thereof, which riles not men, defending each other in an old-boy stylie, but other women?  It's partly that the dangerous predator in question is often characterised not as an individual who behaved badly, but as a symptom of the rottenness at the core of all of society. For instance, Bloom's behaviour ""devastated"" Wolf's sense of ""being valuable to Yale as a student rather than as a pawn of powerful men"". Wolf depicts Bloom as the personification not just of an intellectual landscape (Yale), but of an entire gender (""powerful men""). In so doing, she styles herself as the binary opposite, the personification of her own gender, the eternal pawn or victim. And this is where, as someone who shares that gender, something rises in my throat (and no doubt in Paglia's) - it really is debateable whether or not some drunk bloke putting his face quite near yours and his hand on your thigh, when you thought he'd come round to read poetry, undermines your value to an entire institution. In the barometer that runs from ""misunderstanding"" to ""act of violence"", it leans irrefutably towards the former. So, sure, object to it, at the time or many years afterwards, but not in the name of your gender. Not in the name of people who see no possibility of gender-parity in a world where women achieve victim status simply by being women. Not in my name - object to it in your own name.  Moreover, women making claims of sexual harassment or violation many years after the event often bat off ""why now?"" critics by saying they're doing it for other women; that, at the time, they were too afraid/ young/ powerless to object. Again, this is a flawed position - as an individual, it's up to you when you make an allegation. But if you're doing it under the guise of being a role model, then frankly, you're making a terrible fist of it.

It's better to wait till you're famous, which in all probability you won't be, before you let this kind of thing out of the bag.  Ultimately, sexual politics is the one thing that really dates feminism, that makes it ""old school"" and lets it down. Equal pay for equal work will never go out of fashion. But blanket assumptions of female victimhood and weakness, the inevitability of male exploitation, the drive to politicise every ambiguous physical gesture as if we're all working shoulder to shoulder against malevolent men - this is not feminism. To bundle it all together as such catches a lot of us who cannot agree, like dolphins in a tuna net. No wonder we thrash about so much.","For as long as medicine improves, for as long as birthrates fall, there will be problems with the demographic breakdown of developed societies. There are not enough young people to pay for society's old ones as it stands, and it's only going to get worse. Nobody wants to blame greater life expectancy, since it seems churlish to go to all that effort to prolong life, only to then complain about it. Instead, people point to the falling birthrate. In the past this has caused some rancour among childless women, who get blamed for this when in fact women who have children, but opt to stop at two, are by far the more statistically influential group.The Institute for Public Policy Research has characterised the problem as a ""baby gap"" - women want to have children sooner, and more often, than they do. If maternal desire were satisfied, instead of deferred for the sake of careers, an extra 90,000 babies a year would result. However, owing to the maternal pay gap - which means that a woman of 24 on a medium wage would, should she become a mother, earn &pound;564,000 less over the course of her career - women are putting it off. Sometimes this scotches all chance of becoming a mother; more often, we just have to trim our families down a little.So far, so straightforward - what doesn't seem to be straightforward is the connection between whose pay packet is affected, and who makes all the decisions. We are constantly told what women want, vis-a-vis childbirth, what our priorities are, where our thinking is flawed, which mistakes we're making, how our behaviour affects wider society, and which section of us is driving the trend towards geriatric motherhood.It is absolutely illogical to assume that, just because women do the gory bit at the end, we are in charge of the decision to set the whole business in motion. There are, of course, women who go it alone, banditting sperm from unsuspecting males whom they then screw for cash via the Child Support Agency. These women crop up a lot in execrable radio drama, but very rarely in real life. There are women who end up doing it alone, but this doesn't necessarily mean they decided to have children unilaterally.Pending a more in-depth survey, I imagine that people approach having children the same way they would choosing a holiday or a sofa: in some couples the woman will hold sway; in others, the man will. In lovely, healthy couples, all decisions are made jointly and Relate never gets involved. If people are having children later and later, this must be as much a reflection on what men want as it is on what women want. Lots of you could probably offer me case studies about this or that woman who refused tenancy of her womb for her 20s and 30s because she was having too much fun or earning too much; but for every one of them, there'll be another who was badgering for children from the word go, dismissing financial considerations with a nonchalant ""What do babies need? Love and milk!""And yet we never discuss this as a social trend. Generally, we discuss it as a female trend; just as we never discuss childcare in terms of the damage wrought by ""working parents"", only by ""working mothers"". The process of reproducing is always collaborative when it's going well; the fault of women when it isn't. It's so glaring, I'm always amazed that people think they can get away with it, and yet there it is again in reports that ""work pressures force young women to shelve plans for a family"". From the Observer!Having children is almost always a joint decision; a maternal pay cut is almost always assessed in the context of two salaries; men are invariably involved. This isn't something they're suckered into while they're trying to watch the football."
0,"Whatever the truth of Naomi Wolf's sex-pest accusations against Harold Bloom, nobody, so far, is coming out of the business very well. Wolf picked a funny old time to come out with this charge - not within the two years that charges can be investigated by the authorities; some considerable time after she had made suggestions of harassment on a public forum, though refused to name names (owing to the ""soft spot of complicity"" in her soul); two full decades after the event itself. Bloom has declined to comment, using instead the ""a friend says..."" avenue (the friend, incidentally, has denounced this as a vicious lie), which I always find a bit lame. Sundry other commentators have unleashed a weird level of spite, specifi cally Camille Paglia, who raged: ""It really grates on me that Naomi Wolf for her entire life has been batting her eyes and bobbing her boobs in the face of men and made a profession out of courting male attention.""  An assessment of that kind has to be based upon pretty close personal intimacy - in other words, Paglia needs to have observed Wolf exhibiting that behaviour, at close range and over a period of years. Otherwise, all she's saying is: ""This woman is pretty, and that disqualifies her from reasoned thought.""  I'd also, in the interests of perfect clarity, conduct some research into how transfixed men really are by boobs that bob, but never mind that for the time being. This vitriol is, without question, disproportionate. Had Wolf written an essay claiming that, while at Yale, a professor or student stole from her, hit her over the head with a chair, involved her in a pyramid scheme that was really a scam, or perpetrated any crime at all against her that didn't involve sex, the response would have been different. There might have been some puzzlement that she'd left it so long. There would have been people who questioned her veracity or, at the very least, were prepared to withhold judgment until greater evidence could be provided than the word of the accuser. But there wouldn't be anything like this fury that gushes out like a geyser whenever a woman, especially so tardily, makes a charge of sexual assault, be she an academic or 'er off Shooting Stars (Ulrika Jonsson, I mean). And it almost always comes from other women, handily, if bizarrely uniting feminists, post-feminists, non-feminists and the undecided, in a single voice of unsisterly incandescence. Why should the response be so vehement? What is it about sex crimes, or charges thereof, which riles not men, defending each other in an old-boy stylie, but other women?  It's partly that the dangerous predator in question is often characterised not as an individual who behaved badly, but as a symptom of the rottenness at the core of all of society. For instance, Bloom's behaviour ""devastated"" Wolf's sense of ""being valuable to Yale as a student rather than as a pawn of powerful men"". Wolf depicts Bloom as the personification not just of an intellectual landscape (Yale), but of an entire gender (""powerful men""). In so doing, she styles herself as the binary opposite, the personification of her own gender, the eternal pawn or victim. And this is where, as someone who shares that gender, something rises in my throat (and no doubt in Paglia's) - it really is debateable whether or not some drunk bloke putting his face quite near yours and his hand on your thigh, when you thought he'd come round to read poetry, undermines your value to an entire institution. In the barometer that runs from ""misunderstanding"" to ""act of violence"", it leans irrefutably towards the former. So, sure, object to it, at the time or many years afterwards, but not in the name of your gender. Not in the name of people who see no possibility of gender-parity in a world where women achieve victim status simply by being women. Not in my name - object to it in your own name.  Moreover, women making claims of sexual harassment or violation many years after the event often bat off ""why now?"" critics by saying they're doing it for other women; that, at the time, they were too afraid/ young/ powerless to object. Again, this is a flawed position - as an individual, it's up to you when you make an allegation.

No wonder we thrash about so much.","This morning, shortly after he got up, President Bush considered how to get away from ""pettiness and paltriness of mind"". What did his spiritual guide advise? ""Ask God to keep the eyes of your spirit open to the Risen Christ, and it will be impossible for drudgery to damp you."" Thus fortified, Bush resumed hostilities against Iraq. That the president is a devout, born-'again leader of a crusading administration is well known. An article in Newsweek goes into much more detail about his religious practices, evoking the scene ""ahead of the dawn"", when ""even before he brings his wife, Laura, a morning cup of coffee, he goes off to a quiet place to read alone"". Bush's chosen text, Newsweek discloses, is My Utmost for his Highest, a book of devotional readings by Oswald Chambers, an evangelical bible teacher who died in 1917. It provides a biblical text, along with Chambers' commentary, for every day of the year.  Assuming Newsweek is correct, we can all of us, each day, accompany Bush on his spiritual journey. Tomorrow, for example, he is due to contemplate a passage headed Undaunted Radiance, in which Chambers reminds the sinner that ""the experiences of life, terrible or monotonous, are impotent to touch the love of God...""  The calendar format allows us to look back at key moments in this conflict and identify the spiritual text which might have informed the president's day. On January 20, when he announced that he was ""sick and tired of games and deception"", Bush would have begun with a pre-dawn reflection on Isaiah's response to God's call, ""Here am I; send me"". On February 20, the day Bush agreed, with Blair, on a ""final ultimatum"" he would have considered Chapman's exhortation to action, ""always beware of giving over to mere dreaming once God has spoken"". And if, as was reported then, concerted military attack is still fixed for March 14, then that morning Bush will have his mind on higher things: ""There is no release in human power at all, but only in the Redemption"".  Transcribed by Chambers' wife, Gertrude, after his death from appendicitis, My Utmost for His Highest is less concerned with tips on appropriate conduct, than with the forging of an intimate relationship with God: ""If the crisis has come to you on any line, surrender your will to Him absolutely and irrevocably.""  Spiritually, Chapman is a challenging, relentlessly demanding teacher; in worldly terms, he suggests an almost fatalistic surrender to God's purpose (to be disclosed by the God-given outcome of things), which apparently made Chapman popular among troops in Egypt, where he volunteered as an army chaplain during the first world war. At his funeral, according to Oswald Chambers Publications Association Ltd, the charity which holds world rights in his work, 100 men escorted the gun carriage. The charity's general manager, Mary Hutchison, suggests that his purpose was to impart faith to the soldiers, ""so they could be seen through the crisis"".  Today, with both the Pope and the Anglican church condemning war with Iraq as unjust, you can see how Chapman's message of resolute submission to the Almighty might have considerable appeal for America's commander-in-chief, as he confronts the ""axis of evil"". ""Rise to the occasion, do the thing,"" Chapman urges, ""May God not find the whine in us any more, but may he find us full of spiritual pluck and athleticism, ready to face anything he brings"".  To Hutchison's regret, such reflections have never been as popular here as in the US, where ""Utmost"", as she calls it, has sold two million copies since 1991. In Britain it sells 500 copies a month. Thanks to George Bush, that might change. ""I can't tell you how pleased I am"", she says, ""we're so pleased, we've been praying for years that there would be some kind of revival"". Sometimes, God moves in a most mysterious way. <B>But what about snake oil?</B> Imagine the excitement of Mark Field's London constituents when, for the first time anyone could recall, the Conservative MP wrote asking for comments ""on three issues of national importance"". At last - an MP who really cared what they thought about the war, foundation hospitals, climate change, or similar. But it seems Field is kept awake, of a night, by more pressing questions relating to licensing hours, broadcast communications, and perhaps dearest to his heart, snake oil.   ""I am a regular taker of vitamin supplements"", confessed Field, asking his constituents if alternative medicine should be ""embraced more actively"".  Although, with a war almost on, some constituents find Field's investigations faintly superfluous, such democratic commitment, extending, he stresses, to those who are anxious ""about the harmful health effects of dogs defecating in the streets"", is surely exemplary. And besides, maybe he knows of a good alternative smallpox remedy.<B>Cull New Labour</B>Critics of the impending ruddy duck cull argue that it sets an alarming precedent, and certainly if duck-purity principles were to be applied to British political fauna the consequences would be devastating. Given the similarities between the plight of the rare, white-headed duck and that of the endangered British Tory, now vigorously interbreeding with New Labour to produce a probably sterile hybrid, there is every reason, following ruddy duck logic, to carry out a cull of the American intruder. With some scientists concerned that there may be only one native Tory breeding pair left in the country (Mr and Mrs Nicholas Soames), time is short. True, at 915 per bird - or politician - the cost of such intervention is high and might outrage the British public. On the other hand ducks are widely preferred to MPs; in the absence of any politician welfare groups, the ruthless extermination of New Labour might be seen for what it is, a well-meaning attempt to give nature a helping hand. <B>Torygraph goes gothic</B>Readers of the Daily Telegraph, which has just been subjected to an amusing redesign, are divided on the merits of its gothic-style masthead. Is the heavy typeface once chosen by David Beckham to memorialise the birth of his son in a buttock-skimming tattoo, really up-to-the-minute enough for a happening young paper like the Telegraph? After all, Brooklyn has just celebrated his fourth birthday. But a new Heineken advertising campaign featuring similar lettering on the stomach of the young singer Craig David, confirms that the redesign was worth every penny: in the tattoo parlours that presumably contain its target audience of goths, football fans and connoisseurs of fine lagers, the brand new Telegraph will be a must-have."
1,"As longer licensing hours draw closer, the binge-drink panic movement gathers vim - at the weekend, it was revealed that many pubs intend to ""exploit"" the binge-drink culture, by encouraging punters to drink more. Their methods are nefarious - they might ""upsell"" singles to doubles with such satanic whispers as ""why not make that a double?"" Dave Daley, head of the National Association of Licensed House Managers, muttered darkly, ""How we make our money is to make people binge drink: the more people drink, the more I get as a bonus ... The difference between us and other selling operations is that we're selling a drug."" This piece, in the Observer, was accompanied by a first-hand account of a journalist who was served, with a friend, ""64 units by the same barmaid, no questions asked"". Enough alcohol to kill; though it's worth noting that if a person was drinking those units rather than just ordering them, they would get pretty legless before they died. (My memory of being a barmaid was that you stopped serving someone once they could no longer articulate what they wanted. We weren't expected to count drinks - otherwise we wouldn't have been barmaids, we'd have been playing championship bridge.) It's true that people selling legal drugs are subject to restrictions that people selling board games aren't. Cigarette companies aren't allowed to advertise; alcohol companies have, as a gesture of goodwill, started putting ""please drink responsibly"" on billboards, which is a bit like showing a Land Rover coursing through a snowscape chasing a spy and saying ""please cycle more"" at the end. If you're flogging something actively damaging to health, you can't be too gung-ho in telling everyone what fun it is. But pubs seeking to sell more are doing what any business does: taking an existing market and trying to milk it for all it's worth. Trying to make a special exception for things that are bad for you - booze, fags, fast food - is daft. All excess consumption is, on some level - physiological, psychological, environmental, or all three - bad for everyone, except the seller. The reason we and the government try to make a special case out of health-related selling is because of the NHS, which is the ultimate victim of this aggressive marketing. Its existence is an anomaly - it functions best in the circumstances in which it was created, viz, a more frugal time when people would of course become ill but could be relied on not to try to kill themselves every weekend. It is ideologically out of step with the market principles we thank for our high living standards. If we wanted to be rational and consistent, which thank God we don't, we would can it and open up the illness game to regular forces. It's not only health we get exercised about. Similar moral objections emerge around bookselling giants, which ""cynically"" try to sell more books with dirty-tricks campaigns like putting a lot of bright pink ones in their windows and discontinuing the boring ones. Sure, this is what a shoe shop would do, but books are different because they are ""worthy"" - they have an inherent ethical weight that their manufacturers and distributors ought to respect by not behaving like manufacturers or distributors. In both instances, the revelation is the same: we aren't as comfortable with the free-market economy as we thought. We claim to have embraced, or at least accepted, it but when it comes to matters of importance, the integrity and protection of the body or mind, we return to an anachronistic model of commerce in which both sides are flush with responsibility and respect, though not with cash. So this anti-pub furore, though daft, is also endearing. We can say what we like about modernity, but we aren't as far gone as we thought.","Generally speaking, it's better to be American abroad than English; as hostile a reaction as you're likely to get almost everywhere, you can always pretend to be Canadian. When we get embarrassed by our countryfolk, we just have to look to the middle distance and be more quiet. Sorry, the truth is, I'm not even that embarrassed - this is Cape Town, home, for the next, er, given period of time, to some cricket. There is nothing intrinsically shaming about travelling for sport (though that is emphatically not what I've done), not even if, en masse, you have a twee nickname, like ""barmy army"". There's nothing shaming about moving around in crocodile formations of 50, like a school trip for grown-ups, and I'm way past berating people for travelling halfway round the world and refusing to eat anything but egg and chips (I love egg and chips). No, what makes people point and stare and hits the front page of the Cape Argus, is this: you gather enough English men (and by ""enough"" we can mean ""two"") and drop them into a holiday atmosphere, and the first thing they'll do is start dressing like women.  The barmy army favours schoolgirl chic for 2005, interpreted thus: large blond wig, in pigtails; white shirt, tied at waist; miniskirt of totally mysterious provenance (do their wives run up these garments for them? Or did they all drop into their local transvestite store before leaving?); long socks; and stilettos (ditto with the mystery). It's no accident that you don't spot any slutty nurses or saucy barmaids in the crowd; at some point, in between chartering their barmy planes and discussing their fantasy batting orders, a large number of men agreed that the funniest lady-outfit to pack would be Britney, and it would be funnier still if they all did the same. Bet Lynch is so last year.  This isn't just a cricket thing; it's also a rugby thing, an Ibiza thing, a stag-night thing, a Newcastle-on-a-regular-Saturday thing. The only people who don't do it are football crowds, which I suppose is because prosthetic breasts really undermine your credibility for when you want to have a fight after. Possibly, this makes the cross-dressing a statement of benign intent - a kind of macho white flag, announcing that fights will only be undertaken in the direst of circumstances, since there are Wonderbras involved here, and they're all definitely, positively, on a short-term loan.  And this would dovetail with the rough-hewn symbolism of dressing like females in the first place, a signal that they intend to behave as such, limiting themselves to drinking until they're sick and possibly having unplanned sex, but deter minedly not in the mood to glass anyone in the face. But still, why dress as women? Why not rabbits, or clowns?  Clearly, one's sense of one's own masculinity is immeasurably enhanced by being in a group with a lot of people who are also men. The interpolation of just one individual who isn't male will have a feminising (I'm steering clear of the word ""civilising"") influence so great that it's often   cost-effective for nightclubs to let women in for nothing, since they pay for themselves by preventing breakages. So, if you wanted to experiment with gender ambiguity, to experience the sensation of clothing that would otherwise be considered aberrant, there's no better time to do it than when your true gender identity is most unassailable.  This explains why the barmy army is a good situation in which to experiment, but not why they want to experiment in the first place. Clearly, it's meant to be funny; the hilarity totally passes me by, but then, so does Jacques Tati. And Green Wing. You could argue that women have carte blanche to wear men's clothes at any point, so get no frisson from the idea; I would counter that we're broadly steered away from men's pants, but you don't see us going Y-front crazy on hen nights (oh no, we favour little flashing horns, like sensible people).  There are really only two possibilities - either men have a genuine fear of their oft-peddled ""feminine side"" and express it in this carnivalesque way with the aim of neutralising it; or they all carry a secret desire to obviate women completely, each fulfilling the role of women for one another, because we're so bothersome. This is a pretty big either/or, though - could somebody with a Britney outfit please write in to clarify. With a photo."

A sad, sad song. It's always tough when a hugely talented professional sees his heart's desire slip away. But it is also - no ducking, weaving or glossing - Gordon's own fault: bad politics as well as bad vibrations. Take a few findings from the latest Telegraph/YouGov poll. Do you approve of the government's record to date? No, say 68%. What about issues like Europe and taxation? The Tories are in the lead. And economic competence, the rock of reputations prudently built? Just 32% have kept faith with Brown. And 31% (since you ask) would prefer to see Michael Howard on the Treasury bridge. There's something of the night for all concerned here.  Now polls, of course, can be shrugged away. The chancel-lor's spinners say he'll shrug for Britain today when he tells the Social Market Forum that his ""prudent and cautious"" spending plans are on course, needing no new taxes; that the dear old ""fundamentals are sound""; that while our share prices are only 48% down, Germany's have tumbled a whopping 67%. But this, alas, is politics, not comparative economics. This is show-business. Listen, therefore, to the dismal tinkle of luck and applause running out.  He said there'd be no more boom and bust. That is not how it feels. He took an early pop at the pension funds. Now they're becoming a national crisis, staggering from pillar to post, demolishing ordinary dreams as they go. Just as the taxation tide turns, so last year's national insurance rises snap into place. Just as the cash for public services comes on stream, so the firemen stoke a different boiler. Just as congestion charges arrive, so the Central line goes awol. And then there is university funding.  Every problem that seemed so breezy when there was growth and confidence, in short, now comes glooming round to Gordon's door. Things could be more awful, naturally. That's always true. Yet lustre, once lost, is powerful hard to get shining again.  In a normal Westminster world, you'd know what would happen next. A threat to the chancellor would be a threat to the prime minister and continuing governance. It would thus be loyally batted away unless (like Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson) ritual sacrifices were more the order of the day. A chancellor is there to be defended until it's time, in extremis, to ditch him. But Mr Brown and Mr Blair don't live in a ""normal"" world.  They are both big beasts. Almost a decade ago, they sat over lunch in Islington and made the Granita accord. I won't stand against you for Labour leader (and thus prospective PM) if you quit half-way through your second term and let me have a go. Was it ever quite as neat as that? The old Granita restaurant was a famously noisy, clattery place. Maybe Tony dropped his bread roll at the wrong moment? Maybe Gordon found a fly in his soup? Still ... the legend and the black looks live on.  What we've had for almost six years now isn't the traditional line of command, prime minister down to chancellor, but more a division of the Whitehall realm into two rival kingdoms. The leaders have their own camps and followers. They jockey, needle and probe. They are allies in public and snarlers or sniffers behind the arras. Like North and South Korea, they always need watching. And it's Granita time, time to move over. High noon.  But is Mr Blair going to pack his bags and, like Peter Foster, depart for distant parts? Of course not. That was always an illusion. A disastrous war in Iraq might carry him off - but, in harsh practicality if not morality, it's far more likely that Saddam will crumple and a string of Iraqi scientists thereafter bear witness to the horrors averted. There's no alternative to a continuing Tony. There are, however, plenty of reasons why a continuing Gordon may not be so fireproof. Who wants a magician who's lost his wand? Who wants a baleful, brooding problem when fresh starts are easier?  It is because the realm was divided, because the pieces were scrapped over and parcelled out, that Gordon Brown is suddenly so vulnerable. Traditionally, when a prime minister has a night of the long knives with his neighbour, it is the PM's own status and policies that also appear in the frame. Sacking has its costs. But here the equation is different. Because Brown manifestly runs his own five tests, his own prescriptions for the markets, his own private funding initiatives and target-setting squads, because they are his and not Blair's, so the policies and the man can be simultaneously removed without that damage: a liberation rather than an assassination.  Would there be crisis and flak when the moment came? Inescapably. But it would also set the prime minister free, on course to be his own man with his own chancellor for a third term. It would allow New Labour a new beginning. And to see the logic, you need only consider the alternative: no change, no joy, animosity as usual. Who can possibly settle for another six years of this? Who would want to?  There's the fault with Mr Brown. He shouldn't have believed his own publicity. He should have shifted himself, in triumph, to foreign secretary or deputy PM a year ago. He should have remained forever Mr Boom not Mr Bust. He should have known that, like Jim Callaghan, his time would come if he was loyal and efficient and on the team, not a king over the water. He should, simply, have been smarter."

The barmy army favours schoolgirl chic for 2005, interpreted thus: large blond wig, in pigtails; white shirt, tied at waist; miniskirt of totally mysterious provenance (do their wives run up these garments for them? Or did they all drop into their local transvestite store before leaving?); long socks; and stilettos (ditto with the mystery). It's no accident that you don't spot any slutty nurses or saucy barmaids in the crowd; at some point, in between chartering their barmy planes and discussing their fantasy batting orders, a large number of men agreed that the funniest lady-outfit to pack would be Britney, and it would be funnier still if they all did the same. Bet Lynch is so last year.  This isn't just a cricket thing; it's also a rugby thing, an Ibiza thing, a stag-night thing, a Newcastle-on-a-regular-Saturday thing. The only people who don't do it are football crowds, which I suppose is because prosthetic breasts really undermine your credibility for when you want to have a fight after. Possibly, this makes the cross-dressing a statement of benign intent - a kind of macho white flag, announcing that fights will only be undertaken in the direst of circumstances, since there are Wonderbras involved here, and they're all definitely, positively, on a short-term loan.  And this would dovetail with the rough-hewn symbolism of dressing like females in the first place, a signal that they intend to behave as such, limiting themselves to drinking until they're sick and possibly having unplanned sex, but deter minedly not in the mood to glass anyone in the face. But still, why dress as women? Why not rabbits, or clowns?  Clearly, one's sense of one's own masculinity is immeasurably enhanced by being in a group with a lot of people who are also men. The interpolation of just one individual who isn't male will have a feminising (I'm steering clear of the word ""civilising"") influence so great that it's often   cost-effective for nightclubs to let women in for nothing, since they pay for themselves by preventing breakages. So, if you wanted to experiment with gender ambiguity, to experience the sensation of clothing that would otherwise be considered aberrant, there's no better time to do it than when your true gender identity is most unassailable.  This explains why the barmy army is a good situation in which to experiment, but not why they want to experiment in the first place. Clearly, it's meant to be funny; the hilarity totally passes me by, but then, so does Jacques Tati. And Green Wing. You could argue that women have carte blanche to wear men's clothes at any point, so get no frisson from the idea; I would counter that we're broadly steered away from men's pants, but you don't see us going Y-front crazy on hen nights (oh no, we favour little flashing horns, like sensible people).  There are really only two possibilities - either men have a genuine fear of their oft-peddled ""feminine side"" and express it in this carnivalesque way with the aim of neutralising it; or they all carry a secret desire to obviate women completely, each fulfilling the role of women for one another, because we're so bothersome. This is a pretty big either/or, though - could somebody with a Britney outfit please write in to clarify. With a photo.","Whatever the truth of Naomi Wolf's sex-pest accusations against Harold Bloom, nobody, so far, is coming out of the business very well. Wolf picked a funny old time to come out with this charge - not within the two years that charges can be investigated by the authorities; some considerable time after she had made suggestions of harassment on a public forum, though refused to name names (owing to the ""soft spot of complicity"" in her soul); two full decades after the event itself. Bloom has declined to comment, using instead the ""a friend says..."" avenue (the friend, incidentally, has denounced this as a vicious lie), which I always find a bit lame. Sundry other commentators have unleashed a weird level of spite, specifi cally Camille Paglia, who raged: ""It really grates on me that Naomi Wolf for her entire life has been batting her eyes and bobbing her boobs in the face of men and made a profession out of courting male attention.""  An assessment of that kind has to be based upon pretty close personal intimacy - in other words, Paglia needs to have observed Wolf exhibiting that behaviour, at close range and over a period of years. Otherwise, all she's saying is: ""This woman is pretty, and that disqualifies her from reasoned thought.""  I'd also, in the interests of perfect clarity, conduct some research into how transfixed men really are by boobs that bob, but never mind that for the time being. This vitriol is, without question, disproportionate. Had Wolf written an essay claiming that, while at Yale, a professor or student stole from her, hit her over the head with a chair, involved her in a pyramid scheme that was really a scam, or perpetrated any crime at all against her that didn't involve sex, the response would have been different. There might have been some puzzlement that she'd left it so long. There would have been people who questioned her veracity or, at the very least, were prepared to withhold judgment until greater evidence could be provided than the word of the accuser. But there wouldn't be anything like this fury that gushes out like a geyser whenever a woman, especially so tardily, makes a charge of sexual assault, be she an academic or 'er off Shooting Stars (Ulrika Jonsson, I mean). And it almost always comes from other women, handily, if bizarrely uniting feminists, post-feminists, non-feminists and the undecided, in a single voice of unsisterly incandescence. Why should the response be so vehement? What is it about sex crimes, or charges thereof, which riles not men, defending each other in an old-boy stylie, but other women?  It's partly that the dangerous predator in question is often characterised not as an individual who behaved badly, but as a symptom of the rottenness at the core of all of society. For instance, Bloom's behaviour ""devastated"" Wolf's sense of ""being valuable to Yale as a student rather than as a pawn of powerful men"". Wolf depicts Bloom as the personification not just of an intellectual landscape (Yale), but of an entire gender (""powerful men""). In so doing, she styles herself as the binary opposite, the personification of her own gender, the eternal pawn or victim. And this is where, as someone who shares that gender, something rises in my throat (and no doubt in Paglia's) - it really is debateable whether or not some drunk bloke putting his face quite near yours and his hand on your thigh, when you thought he'd come round to read poetry, undermines your value to an entire institution. In the barometer that runs from ""misunderstanding"" to ""act of violence"", it leans irrefutably towards the former. So, sure, object to it, at the time or many years afterwards, but not in the name of your gender. Not in the name of people who see no possibility of gender-parity in a world where women achieve victim status simply by being women. Not in my name - object to it in your own name.  Moreover, women making claims of sexual harassment or violation many years after the event often bat off ""why now?"" critics by saying they're doing it for other women; that, at the time, they were too afraid/ young/ powerless to object. Again, this is a flawed position - as an individual, it's up to you when you make an allegation. But if you're doing it under the guise of being a role model, then frankly, you're making a terrible fist of it. You're basically saying, as much confidence and rage and mettle and verbal aplomb as I had 20 years ago, it was still too daunting and too humiliating to report this crime. It's better to wait till you're famous, which in all probability you won't be, before you let this kind of thing out of the bag.  Ultimately, sexual politics is the one thing that really dates feminism, that makes it ""old school"" and lets it down. Equal pay for equal work will never go out of fashion. But blanket assumptions of female victimhood and weakness, the inevitability of male exploitation, the drive to politicise every ambiguous physical gesture as if we're all working shoulder to shoulder against malevolent men - this is not feminism. To bundle it all together as such catches a lot of us who cannot agree, like dolphins in a tuna net. No wonder we thrash about so much."

It's always tough when a hugely talented professional sees his heart's desire slip away. But it is also - no ducking, weaving or glossing - Gordon's own fault: bad politics as well as bad vibrations. Take a few findings from the latest Telegraph/YouGov poll. Do you approve of the government's record to date? No, say 68%. What about issues like Europe and taxation? The Tories are in the lead. And economic competence, the rock of reputations prudently built? Just 32% have kept faith with Brown. And 31% (since you ask) would prefer to see Michael Howard on the Treasury bridge. There's something of the night for all concerned here.  Now polls, of course, can be shrugged away. The chancel-lor's spinners say he'll shrug for Britain today when he tells the Social Market Forum that his ""prudent and cautious"" spending plans are on course, needing no new taxes; that the dear old ""fundamentals are sound""; that while our share prices are only 48% down, Germany's have tumbled a whopping 67%. But this, alas, is politics, not comparative economics. This is show-business. Listen, therefore, to the dismal tinkle of luck and applause running out.  He said there'd be no more boom and bust. That is not how it feels. He took an early pop at the pension funds. Now they're becoming a national crisis, staggering from pillar to post, demolishing ordinary dreams as they go. Just as the taxation tide turns, so last year's national insurance rises snap into place. Just as the cash for public services comes on stream, so the firemen stoke a different boiler. Just as congestion charges arrive, so the Central line goes awol. And then there is university funding.  Every problem that seemed so breezy when there was growth and confidence, in short, now comes glooming round to Gordon's door. Things could be more awful, naturally. That's always true. Yet lustre, once lost, is powerful hard to get shining again.  In a normal Westminster world, you'd know what would happen next. A threat to the chancellor would be a threat to the prime minister and continuing governance. It would thus be loyally batted away unless (like Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson) ritual sacrifices were more the order of the day. A chancellor is there to be defended until it's time, in extremis, to ditch him. But Mr Brown and Mr Blair don't live in a ""normal"" world.  They are both big beasts. Almost a decade ago, they sat over lunch in Islington and made the Granita accord. I won't stand against you for Labour leader (and thus prospective PM) if you quit half-way through your second term and let me have a go. Was it ever quite as neat as that? The old Granita restaurant was a famously noisy, clattery place. Maybe Tony dropped his bread roll at the wrong moment? Maybe Gordon found a fly in his soup? Still ... the legend and the black looks live on.  What we've had for almost six years now isn't the traditional line of command, prime minister down to chancellor, but more a division of the Whitehall realm into two rival kingdoms. The leaders have their own camps and followers. They jockey, needle and probe. They are allies in public and snarlers or sniffers behind the arras. Like North and South Korea, they always need watching. And it's Granita time, time to move over. High noon.  But is Mr Blair going to pack his bags and, like Peter Foster, depart for distant parts? Of course not. That was always an illusion. A disastrous war in Iraq might carry him off - but, in harsh practicality if not morality, it's far more likely that Saddam will crumple and a string of Iraqi scientists thereafter bear witness to the horrors averted. There's no alternative to a continuing Tony. There are, however, plenty of reasons why a continuing Gordon may not be so fireproof. Who wants a magician who's lost his wand? Who wants a baleful, brooding problem when fresh starts are easier?  It is because the realm was divided, because the pieces were scrapped over and parcelled out, that Gordon Brown is suddenly so vulnerable. Traditionally, when a prime minister has a night of the long knives with his neighbour, it is the PM's own status and policies that also appear in the frame. Sacking has its costs. But here the equation is different. Because Brown manifestly runs his own five tests, his own prescriptions for the markets, his own private funding initiatives and target-setting squads, because they are his and not Blair's, so the policies and the man can be simultaneously removed without that damage: a liberation rather than an assassination.  Would there be crisis and flak when the moment came? Inescapably. But it would also set the prime minister free, on course to be his own man with his own chancellor for a third term. It would allow New Labour a new beginning. And to see the logic, you need only consider the alternative: no change, no joy, animosity as usual. Who can possibly settle for another six years of this? Who would want to?  There's the fault with Mr Brown. He shouldn't have believed his own publicity. He should have shifted himself, in triumph, to foreign secretary or deputy PM a year ago. He should have remained forever Mr Boom not Mr Bust. He should have known that, like Jim Callaghan, his time would come if he was loyal and efficient and on the team, not a king over the water. He should, simply, have been smarter."

If maternal desire were satisfied, instead of deferred for the sake of careers, an extra 90,000 babies a year would result. However, owing to the maternal pay gap - which means that a woman of 24 on a medium wage would, should she become a mother, earn &pound;564,000 less over the course of her career - women are putting it off.

Catch it before it departs into the maw of another mandate where all is forgiven and much forgotten. See what power did in one particular zone, which I'm still prepared to call the moral sensibility of ministers. Not only have their arteries hardened and their consciences grown dull. That's to be expected under the weight of office. More startling is how easily the gates of perception, their sense of what they are doing, have been closed and locked.  When they came to power, one principle they seemed unbreakably attached to was a detestation of racial prejudice. Equality of racial justice and hostility to ethnic discrimination were ideals that united old and new Labour. To men like Tony Blair and Jack Straw they were articles of faith, which lay behind both the swift abolition of the Tories' primary-purpose rule challenging migrant spouses to prove they had any right to join their partners, and the later setting up of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. To Blair and Straw it is unimaginable that they could be party to anything but the most impeccable correctness in all matters that touch on race.   Yet they have been. Two weeks ago, I wrote about the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which outlawed ethnic discrimination by public authorities but made an exception for the immigration service. I unearthed a ministerial order which authorised immigration officers   to treat people of certain nationalities - unspecified, but to be identified at the future decision of ministers and officials - worse than other people. Replying to the critique, Straw pleaded a mere drafting technicality and termed my attack ""bizarre"".   But this order was only a beginning. There has now been a second one, dated April 23, which extends the reach from nationalities to what it describes, in its own headline, as ""discrimination on ground of ethnic or national origin"". This time the ethnics in question are listed: ""a) Kurd, b) Roma, c) Albanian, d) Tamil, e) Pontic Greek, f) Somali, g) Afghan"". All persons of these origins are now to be subject ""to a more rigorous examination than other persons in the same circumstances"". They can be detained, questioned and rejected, as a class, more freely than other people because they are now deemed prima facie more likely to be illegal immigrants or bogus asylum-seekers.   They have something else in common, however. There is no Kurdish passport, there is no Roma passport. Identifying these people can be attempted through little more than their personal appearance, plus some inference from the flight or possibly boat they arrive on. So, not only is the bar on collective discrimination being ditched, but a peculiarly vicious form of sorting is written into statute, whereby immigration officers herd together anyone who looks like a Kurd or a Tamil or a Pontic Greek - regardless of whether these   come, as Tamils do, from Sri Lanka, Canada, India or even the UK - and impose special oppression on them.   Ministers' handling of this law went through two phases. The first, during passage, was to pretend it was benign. The only purpose they cited was to make it easier to discriminate in favour of, say, Kosovan refugees. When pressed by Liberal Democrats such as Lord Lester, that was the scenario they repeatedly mentioned. They were lying. It is quite apparent from the April 23 order that what they wanted all along was the power to authorise state-sponsored mass exclusion of certain ethnic groups, without regard for individual justice, on a scale never before seen in this country.    Phase two came last week. The new law, said Barbara Roche, Straw's minion in charge of immigration, was merely giving formal shape to a practice that had been going on a long time. She was almost flippant in her incredulity that anyone should complain about a long-established pattern of ethnic selection. She talked about the need for ""objective evidence"" against each migrant. But no one has explained how a Roma is meant to overcome the ethnic evidence against him, especially in view of the further sub-clause in the order which states, almost incredibly: ""If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.""   Three conclusions can be drawn from this. First, whether or not ethnic selection went on before, it has now been systematised. If an apparent Kurd, or potential Roma, or notional Pontic Greek has by some oversight not been discriminated against, ministers may want to know the reason why. Immigration controllers are now on formal notice as to which ethnic and national origins are especially unwelcome in Britain. Their conduct will be policed by someone called a ""race monitor"", but only retrospectively and without attention to individual cases. The monitor is plainly a PR stooge in the making.   Second, as the government's contribution to present discontents over asylum, this is political cowardice on a grand scale. No one disputes the need for immigration control. But faced by the mighty force of Ann Widdecombe, Blair and Straw are evidently terrified of electoral punishment if they can't match her rhetoric of national alarm with measures of ethnic hostility. Though all these politicians avow their respect for genuine cases, it's the tritest lip service. Straw collaborates with Widdecombe in a discourse from which only the Lib Dems stand aside, that stigmatises asylum itself as presumptively a bogus concept, eating away at the resources of the fifth largest economy in the world.   Third, something unpleasant has happened to Labour in power. For all sorts of reasons, they need to win the election. I hope they do. They're the only plausible choice on offer and defend several important policies that will probably, given time, make this country a better place. But their immigration regime shows not only that they've become, in a vital area, as bad as the Tories, but that they have lost their intellectual as well as moral faculties. They appear not to know what they're doing. They sincerely believe they do not favour ethnic discrimination. Straw, the posturing anti-racist, thinks any challenge to his law can only be ""bizarre"". He is surrounded by a party that seems to believe the same - barely a squeak came out of it when the law went through.   Such, it seems, is today's corruption of power: not so much a conspiracy of self-interest as the building of a wall of righteous self-belief. A power-driven certainty that, because one is who one is, one can by definition do no wrong. This law of ethnic punishment is a disgrace. Perhaps only a party infused by belief in its own anti-racism would have the nerve to smuggle it past the frontier that separates a decent country from a shameful one."

If you were to come down from space, I mean, and read the papers. Not if you were actually on a protest march.All regular marches against all regular evils are populated by extremely pretty 18-year-old women. The template for this was the Paris student riots of 1968. ""Never mind the issues,"" said we English. ""Why can't we have one of those very attractive blond ladies, waving flags? Why do we always have to have beardy trade unionists?"" However, innovators pointed out that we, too, could have young women at demonstrations - all we needed to do was concentrate, like we do when the A-level results come out. See that group of young men, with spots, punching the air, making you feel ashamed for your nation, nay, species? Ignore them. Ignore the fat ones, who are crying. Happy... young... yes, you're almost there... female. Bingo. If you were to come down from space, you could be forgiven for thinking that men weren't allowed to take A-levels at all; they took some kind of BTEC, the results of which came out on Christmas Day and sadly couldn't be published.Anyway, there are, of course, some exceptions to the Pretty Protester rule. Protesters against war, environmental issues, poll tax, these will all be pretty - even publications that are fervently in favour of poll tax will concede there are some very pretty women around and it would be a shame not to take pictures of them. Countryside Alliance marches, as represented in the leftwing press, will, again, involve some very pretty people. In the rightwing press, however, they will mainly be populated by families. These are proper people, with proper sperm, put to proper use. Anarchist protesters, however, are not ladies. They are aggressive young men. Rationale: these marches were not cleared with the police; attractive people do not break the law; ergo, there were no attractive people at this protest. Either that, or the coloured mohican hairstyles were so special it seemed a shame to overshadow them with blondness.Likewise, on a march where the majority are Muslims, there won't be any pretty ones. If there are pretty ones, they will have snuck in, under an umbrella of shouting people. And really, I can't make up my mind which is less respectful - the pretty approach, which is really a means of saying, ""We don't need to worry about these people, they are just young, with high spirits,"" or the non-pretty approach, which is a way of saying, ""Do worry about these people; they may also be young, but they mean you no good.""Ideally, of course, the pictures chosen to represent a march should be of a sensible, not particularly attractive person, of a sensible, not particularly young age, chanting a sensible chant, not disfigured by hate and rage. Someone like me. Only take pictures of me. I'm always there. I'll be near the back.","As longer licensing hours draw closer, the binge-drink panic movement gathers vim - at the weekend, it was revealed that many pubs intend to ""exploit"" the binge-drink culture, by encouraging punters to drink more. Their methods are nefarious - they might ""upsell"" singles to doubles with such satanic whispers as ""why not make that a double?"" Dave Daley, head of the National Association of Licensed House Managers, muttered darkly, ""How we make our money is to make people binge drink: the more people drink, the more I get as a bonus ... The difference between us and other selling operations is that we're selling a drug."" This piece, in the Observer, was accompanied by a first-hand account of a journalist who was served, with a friend, ""64 units by the same barmaid, no questions asked"". Enough alcohol to kill; though it's worth noting that if a person was drinking those units rather than just ordering them, they would get pretty legless before they died. (My memory of being a barmaid was that you stopped serving someone once they could no longer articulate what they wanted. We weren't expected to count drinks - otherwise we wouldn't have been barmaids, we'd have been playing championship bridge.) It's true that people selling legal drugs are subject to restrictions that people selling board games aren't. Cigarette companies aren't allowed to advertise; alcohol companies have, as a gesture of goodwill, started putting ""please drink responsibly"" on billboards, which is a bit like showing a Land Rover coursing through a snowscape chasing a spy and saying ""please cycle more"" at the end. If you're flogging something actively damaging to health, you can't be too gung-ho in telling everyone what fun it is. But pubs seeking to sell more are doing what any business does: taking an existing market and trying to milk it for all it's worth. Trying to make a special exception for things that are bad for you - booze, fags, fast food - is daft. All excess consumption is, on some level - physiological, psychological, environmental, or all three - bad for everyone, except the seller. The reason we and the government try to make a special case out of health-related selling is because of the NHS, which is the ultimate victim of this aggressive marketing. Its existence is an anomaly - it functions best in the circumstances in which it was created, viz, a more frugal time when people would of course become ill but could be relied on not to try to kill themselves every weekend. It is ideologically out of step with the market principles we thank for our high living standards. If we wanted to be rational and consistent, which thank God we don't, we would can it and open up the illness game to regular forces. It's not only health we get exercised about. Similar moral objections emerge around bookselling giants, which ""cynically"" try to sell more books with dirty-tricks campaigns like putting a lot of bright pink ones in their windows and discontinuing the boring ones. Sure, this is what a shoe shop would do, but books are different because they are ""worthy"" - they have an inherent ethical weight that their manufacturers and distributors ought to respect by not behaving like manufacturers or distributors. In both instances, the revelation is the same: we aren't as comfortable with the free-market economy as we thought. We claim to have embraced, or at least accepted, it but when it comes to matters of importance, the integrity and protection of the body or mind, we return to an anachronistic model of commerce in which both sides are flush with responsibility and respect, though not with cash. So this anti-pub furore, though daft, is also endearing. We can say what we like about modernity, but we aren't as far gone as we thought."

Rob Daves, the paper's pollster, saw the crowd gathering on the front steps as he came out for his lunchtime jog. He didn't realise why they were there and went off on his run. By the time he got back, they were gone, which was just as well because much of the rage and derision was directed at him. 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, Rob Daves has got to go!' the Republican pickets chanted. 'Liberals!' they screamed at hacks leaving for a bite to eat. It may not sound much of an insult to you, but in conservative America alleging that journalists are liberals is almost as wounding as alleging that they are communists, which the demonstrators proceeded to do when they switched to the chant of 'Star and Sickle, you're in a pickle'.  The Star and Tribune had a run a poll saying that John Kerry had a 9 per cent lead over George W Bush in Minnesota. Rival polls claimed the race was tied. The paper's editor had endorsed Kerry, and the Republicans believed they had uncovered a liberal plot to convince their supporters that there was no point turning out to vote.  Over in New York, moveon.org, an alliance of two million Bush loathers who, like the Minnesota Republicans, are unlikely to get through the tension of election night without a nervous collapse, paid for an attack ad in the New York Times. 'Why Does America's Top Pollster Keep Getting it Wrong?' it wanted to know. Gallup's polls, used by CNN and USA Today, had given Bush a 14 point lead but other polls conducted at the same time put it at around 3 per cent. The Kerryites noted that George Gallup Jr, son of the poll's founder and director of its research centre, was a born-again Christian of the nosiest type who had said earlier this year that 'the most profound purpose of polls is to see how people are responding to God'.  'We thought the purpose is to faithfully and factually report public opinion,' moveon.org retorted with a sniff.  You get the picture. Religious fundamentalists in the polling industry back God and Bush and do nothing to dispel the helpful illusion that the President is invincible.  The polling companies dismissed the protests as overheated allegations from an angry campaign. But the demonstrators were on to something. How can one poll give Kerry a nine point lead in Minnesota and others give him no lead at all? Why do CNN viewers hear that Bush is cruising to a landslide victory, while he's in the tightest race imaginable on other channels? Why for that matter has Labour's poll share in the past month bounced between 28 per cent and 39 per cent according to which newspaper your read? Are any of these figures true or false? And if newspapers and broadcasters can't say they're true, why do they pretend that they are facts on a par with the statement 'Yasser Arafat was admitted to hospital last week'?  The pollsters can't all be right, but they may all be wrong, and a few American journalists have the guts to admit it.  Sceptics in the media have always seen opinion polls as crooked: not as deceitful as horoscopes, but way short of the exacting standards met by the racing tipsters. Where the Minnesota Republicans and the New York liberals get it wrong is to assume the crookedness is the result of political bias. To be sure, pollsters are a part of the process which sets 'the agenda' and determines which political positions are 'appropriate' and which politicians are 'credible', but most are honest by their own lights. It's just that their lights are dimming with each passing year.  Last week the Washington Post 's pollster Richard Morin wrote a long, despairing piece whose headline 'Don't Ask Me' said it all. In Britain, the campaign polls may have underestimated Tory support in the last three elections, but the exit polls, which have far more money behind them, were reasonably close in 1997 and 2001. Morin noted that in the US, even the exit polls were a shambles.  The reason why pollsters fear their racket is 'on the way to extinction' is that the public is fed up with being pestered by hucksters. If you think about it, talking to a polling company is an odd way to behave. Strangers ask you to give them time and personal information for nothing so that they can profit from it. Once the pollsters had few competitors, now everyone's at it. In the vast United States the only way to sample the electorate is by phone.  But the polling companies aren't the only people cold calling at the precise moment when the dinner has boiled over and the baby's nappy exploded. Telemarketers infest the country. To combat them, there are call screening systems and attempts in state legislatures to make cold calling illegal. Those who can't stop the pollsters getting through are fighting back with ingenious technologies.  The Washington Post told the sad story of Rick Klaastad, a market researcher for a polling company in Oregon, who dialled an elderly man on his contact list. 'Apparently he has some electronic device attached to the phone and the next thing I hear was this loud, painful sound. It was as about as bad as it gets - imagine turning an FM stereo up full blast with a really good set of speakers. It bruised my eardrum.'  Huge numbers refuse to talk to pollsters. Morin found that 'in some surveys fewer than one in five calls produces a completed interview - raising doubts whether such polls accurately reflect the views of the public or merely report the opinions of stay-at-home Americans who are too bored, too infirm or too lonely to hang up.'  To put it at its politest, I think it's fair to say that American polls aren't want scientists call random samples.  Nor are they in Britain. Whenever the media is forced to ask whether findings that 57.2 per cent of the population don't trust Tony Blair or 12.8 per cent of twentysomething women have given up one-night stands after a three-in-a-bed romp with a two-timing love rat are true, it always quotes pollsters. What journalists neglect to mention is that the polling industry makes its real money from business, not newspapers or television. If CEOs began to suspect that the beguilingly precise findings on the existence of niche markets were false, tens of millions of pounds would be lost.  If you leave the self-interested defenders of the industry behind and turn to objective outsiders such as Roger Jowell, who runs the British Social Attitudes Survey, you find that they have been saying for years that opinion polls aren't random samples.  He explains the persistent failure to get Tory support right in campaign polls by the fact that a sizeable number of Conservatives think that time is money and don't see why they should give something for nothing. They brush past the market researcher standing in the street with a tight smile. Labour supporters and Liberal Democrats are kinder people who are more likely to help out a stranger.  Whether they will continue to do so is doubtful. Commerce is crowding into private space via junk mail, cold calls, texted adverts and the street confrontations arranged by those lovable charities. Cold calling has prejudiced Americans against telephone polling. Chugging and other forms of aggressive begging are likely to prejudice a fair chunk of the British against the poor woman in the shopping centre trying to scratch a living wage from Mori.  A lot flows from the decline of polling. First, readers who are close to tears because most US polls give Bush a slight lead can relax until election night. Only two of the 11 final national polls were right in 2000 - and there's no reason to believe that that dismal record will be bettered. (Conversely, Bush supporters - a minority among you, I suspect - shouldn't be too cocksure, defeat or a landslide is as likely as a narrow win.)  Second, all the focus-group policies the government uses to please the electorate may not only be wrong in principle but a failure in practice because the public may very well not be pleased in the least.  Finally, if the next election is as messy as a few of us suspect, with three-cornered contests taking place across the country and voters deciding whether to vote tactically against Blair or the Tories, the polls will be all important to people who want to work out what the consequences of their vote will be. They should know in advance that there's a fair chance that the polls will be tosh."
1,"The NHS is under-resourced. Every user knows it. Its staff know it. The political establishment accepts it. The Prime Minister has admitted as much. Britain has fewer doctors and hospital beds per head than almost any other country in Europe. More needs to be spent, so when Blair committed himself last week to raising health expenditure to the European average by the end of the next parliament there should have been a national sense of relief. Instead it was an occasion for hand-wringing, Prime Ministerial wobble and general disbelief.  It couldn't be done, it was said. There isn't and there won't be enough money. Blair was dodging difficult choices about which taxes to raise. The Conservatives insisted that the only means to this end was to allow the private sector to lead the charge, urging the reintroduction of tax relief for private health insurance. And then Number 10 seemed to get windy, briefing on Monday that it was only an aspiration - and conditional in any case on the economy doing well.   But for once beleaguered liberal Britain should not look a gift horse in the mouth; this is an occasion for a cheer. The Prime Minister, despite his partial retreat, has set an important benchmark for the desirable growth of NHS spending, and by implication other key programmes such as education and transport. He has also put down a marker that the extraordinarily large Treasury surpluses projected in the years ahead will be spent on improving   public services and not given away in tax cuts. And he has put the Tories on the spot; they have to match his commitment or demonstrate that private health insurance can achieve the same result - a demonstration that is beyond them. In the new politics of how to spend the budget surpluses, Blair - panicked perhaps by the hysterical reaction to the comparatively small rise in flu cases and media overkill - has set the political agenda. It is an important moment.   The scale of the implied increase in NHS spending is vast. The 50 billion (in round numbers) spent on the NHS in Britain at the moment is 5.7 per cent of GDP; another 9bn - or 1 per cent of GDP - is spent on health privately. The crude European average is 8 per cent of GDP, but that is simply arrived at by adding up each country's average and dividing it by the total, so that Luxembourg's spending has the same importance as Germany's. If you weight the calculation by size of country, the real average of European health spending, according to the King's Fund, is 8.6 per cent of GDP.   Because the Blair Government does not plan to expand the private health sector, it will have to pay to close the gap of 1.9 per cent of GDP itself - 17bn at today's prices. If it wants to do that over the next six years, health spending will have to rise by just under 8 per cent a year in real terms to 2006; if spending grows at only 5 per cent annum in real terms - the figure the Prime Minister cited - then it will take a full 12 years to reach the true European average. And if the Europeans further increase spending, then it will take longer still. It takes time to redress a generation of neglect.   Can 8 per cent growth in NHS spending until 2006 be achieved without raising taxes? The straight answer is yes, even though it would push Gordon Brown's demanding framework for spending and borrowing to the limit. But spending in every other department   could only grow in line with the growth of GDP, the reason for Cabinet restiveness last week.   If this is a surprise, it is because almost nobody seems to have come to terms with the transformation in public finances under New Labour. The combination of Brown's 'stealth' taxes, equivalent to more than 2 per cent of GDP, sticking to the Conservatives' spending plans for the first two years of this parliament, economic growth of close to 2 per cent instead of recession in 1999, the fall in unemployment and continuing low inflation has been stunning. The current budget surplus last year was 7bn; it will more than double by 2003.   Indeed if the long run economic growth rate is the 2.5 per cent now assumed by the Treasury, then as the TUC calculated in its submission to the Treasury's Spending Review last week, public spending could be raised another 12bn by 2004 and, on my calculations, to the necessary 17bn for the NHS by 2006 - and still leave the 7bn safety margin Brown had last year.   If growth turns out lower, then the NHS budget can be protected by running down the safety margin; and in an economic downturn borrowing is allowed even under Brown's rules. A European class health service is ours for the having - and without raising taxes.   The Conservative proposition that the alternative can be achieved through private insurance is for the birds and, while New Labour retreats and tem porises in so many areas of policy, it is good to see some iron in its soul over private medical insurance. It is expensive, focused on those who are good medical risks, and rarely extends to the over-75s who are most in need. Worse, even if it worked in building up the private sector, it would have the perverse result of driving up the NHS's cost as private contractors bid up wages to attract the limited number of trained staff.   But the proof is in the pudding. Tax relief on medical insurance for the over-60s was introduced in 1990; but by 1997, when Labour abolished it, only 1 per cent more of the over-60s had taken advantage of the tax break. Moreover as the human genome project is completed, we will soon know each individual's DNA structure and predicted health experience; in this emerging world private insurance is madness, because those known to be poor risks will simply not be able to insure themselves at a reasonable premium. Poor Liam Fox, the Shadow Health Secretary, is stuck with a ludicrous, provenly unworkable policy that is out of kilter with the times - the mirror image of Labour's 1983 far-fetched commitment to extend nationalisation to promote economic efficiency.   The only way to fund the NHS is through general taxation or comprehensive social insurance; the hypothecated health tax is another blind alley. If all NHS spending is dependent on a stand-alone or hypothecated tax, then its revenues will go up and down with the economic cycle; if only part is hypothecated, then by the second or third year it becomes impossible to disentangle what is new and what is old money.   On the NHS New Labour is making a stand. What it needs to do next is to drop building privately financed hospitals with fewer beds, genuinely end the internal market and redress the system's disgraceful lack accountability - and we really could start cheering.","The most important political event last week for Britain did not take place at the Labour party conference in Brighton, but in Travis County, Texas. District Attorney Ronnie Earle charged the second most powerful man in the United States, Tom DeLay, with criminal conspiracy. DeLay resigned as the majority leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives while he fights the case, a stunning political setback.American conservatism that has shaped American and British politics for 20 years has been holed below the waterline. It will take a lot more to sink it, but DeLay's indictment is symptomatic of a conservative over-reach and endemic corruption that will trigger, at the very least, a retreat and maybe even more. One-Nation Tories and honest-to-God Labour politicians can take some succour; the right-wing wind that has blown across the Atlantic for nearly a generation is about to ease. Hypocrisies have been exposed. The discourse in British politics is set to change.The story begins in the murky world of campaign finance and the grey area of quasi-corruption, kickbacks and personal favours that now define the American political system. American politicians need ever more cash to fight their political campaigns and gerrymander their constituencies, so creating the political truth that incumbents rarely lose. US corporations are the consistent suppliers of the necessary dollars and Republican politicians increasingly are the principal beneficiaries. Complicated rules exist to try to ensure the relationship between companies and politicians is as much at arm's length as possible; the charge against DeLay is that he drove a coach and horses through the rules.If DeLay were another Republican politician or even a typical majority leader of the House, the political world could shrug its shoulders. Somebody got caught, but little will change. But DeLay is very different. He is the Republican paymaster, one of the authors of the K Street Project and the driving force behind a vicious, organised demonisation and attempted marginalisation of Democrats that for sheer, unabashed political animus is unlike anything else witnessed in an advanced democracy. Politicians fight their political foes by fair means or foul, but trying to exterminate them is new territory.The K Street Project is little known outside the Washington beltway and its effectiveness as a political stratagem is only possible because of the unique importance of campaign finance to American politics. DeLay, together with Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and some conservative activists, notably the ubiquitous Grover Norquist who runs the anti-state, anti-tax lobby group 'Americans for Tax Reform', conceived the notion 10 years ago that they should use the Republican majority in the House as a lever to ensure that the lobbyists, law firms and trade associations that inhabit Washington's K Street, heart of the industry, should only employ Republicans or sympathisers. To be a Democrat was to bear the mark of Cain; K Street was to be a Democrat-free zone.This, if it could be pulled off, would have multiple pay-backs. Special-interest groups and companies have always greased the palms of American law-makers and because of lack of party discipline, they have had to grease Democrat and Republican palms alike to get the legislation they wanted. DeLay's ambition was to construct such a disciplined Republican party that lobbyists would not need Democrats, and so create an inside track in which the only greased palms from legislators to lobbyists would be Republican.Lobbyists, law firms and trade associations should be told not to employ Democrats, so progressively excluding them from access to the lucrative channels of campaign finance. Democrats would become both poorer and politically diminished at a stroke and the Republicans would become richer and politically hegemonic.It has worked. The most influential Washington lobbyist is Barbour, Griffiths and Rogers; it employs not a single Democrat. Last year, in a classic operation, House Republicans let the Motion Picture Association of America (the film industry lobby group) know that appointing a Democrat, Dan Glickman, as its head would mean $1.5 billion of tax relief for the film industry was now in peril. Glickman staffed up the MPAA with Republicans, but the threat remains. In 2003, the Republican National Committee could claim that 33 of the top 36 top-level K Street positions were in Republican hands. Today, it's even closer to a clean sweep.Corporations get their rewards. The oil and gas industry now gives 80 per cent of its campaign cash to Republicans (20 years ago, the split was roughly 50-50), and influence on this year's energy bill was a classic sting. American petrol can now contain a suspected carcinogen; operators of US natural-gas wells can contaminate water aquifers to improve the yields from the wells; the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is open to oil exploration - concessions all created by DeLay's inside track. And to provide ideological juice, there's a bevy of think-tanks, paid for from the same web of contributions, cranking out the justification that the 'state' and 'regulation' are everywhere and always wrong.But central to the operation is DeLay's mastery of the party in the House. To get two more Republican votes in his pocket, he organised a gerrymander in Texas to create two more seats in the 2004 election and gave the Republican campaign there some extra campaign money. The trouble was, alleges the DA, the cash from Washington originally came from Texan companies, which are forbidden directly to back individual candidates and that DeLay devised the illegal scheme.DeLay vigorously insists he's the victim of a partisan stitch-up, surely a case of the biter bit? Yet the scope for misdirection of political funds is huge. Michael Scanlon, DeLay's director of communications for six years, is under criminal investigation together with partner Jack Abramoff for the way they used $66 million, paid by 11 casino-owning native American tribes over three years into their K Street operation, and which seems to have financed, among other extraordinary expenditures, a DeLay golf trip to Scotland. Nobody checks too much on how their money is deployed as long as it brings results - access, tax breaks and legislative concessions. DeLay, Scanlon and Abramoff belong to the same culture.In Congress, moderate Republicans don't want guilt by association and companies value their reputation. The K Street Project stinks, along with all those associated with it. So far, the US media have been supine. DeLay's tentacles, and those of Karl Rove, Bush's top political adviser, have cowed media owners into the same compliance; if they want favours, best advance the Republican cause like Murdoch's Fox News. American newsrooms are fearful places.But DeLay's indictment breaks back the dam. US politics moves in cycles. Once it was Republicans who were going to clean up corrupt Democrat Washington; now Democrats can champion the same cause. Nor can the media afford to be on the side of the Old Corruption; it's bad for business. The wheel is turning, an important moment both sides of the Atlantic."

The Conservatives insisted that the only means to this end was to allow the private sector to lead the charge, urging the reintroduction of tax relief for private health insurance. And then Number 10 seemed to get windy, briefing on Monday that it was only an aspiration - and conditional in any case on the economy doing well.   But for once beleaguered liberal Britain should not look a gift horse in the mouth; this is an occasion for a cheer. The Prime Minister, despite his partial retreat, has set an important benchmark for the desirable growth of NHS spending, and by implication other key programmes such as education and transport. He has also put down a marker that the extraordinarily large Treasury surpluses projected in the years ahead will be spent on improving   public services and not given away in tax cuts. And he has put the Tories on the spot; they have to match his commitment or demonstrate that private health insurance can achieve the same result - a demonstration that is beyond them. In the new politics of how to spend the budget surpluses, Blair - panicked perhaps by the hysterical reaction to the comparatively small rise in flu cases and media overkill - has set the political agenda. It is an important moment.   The scale of the implied increase in NHS spending is vast. The 50 billion (in round numbers) spent on the NHS in Britain at the moment is 5.7 per cent of GDP; another 9bn - or 1 per cent of GDP - is spent on health privately. The crude European average is 8 per cent of GDP, but that is simply arrived at by adding up each country's average and dividing it by the total, so that Luxembourg's spending has the same importance as Germany's. If you weight the calculation by size of country, the real average of European health spending, according to the King's Fund, is 8.6 per cent of GDP.   Because the Blair Government does not plan to expand the private health sector, it will have to pay to close the gap of 1.9 per cent of GDP itself - 17bn at today's prices. If it wants to do that over the next six years, health spending will have to rise by just under 8 per cent a year in real terms to 2006; if spending grows at only 5 per cent annum in real terms - the figure the Prime Minister cited - then it will take a full 12 years to reach the true European average. And if the Europeans further increase spending, then it will take longer still. It takes time to redress a generation of neglect.   Can 8 per cent growth in NHS spending until 2006 be achieved without raising taxes? The straight answer is yes, even though it would push Gordon Brown's demanding framework for spending and borrowing to the limit. But spending in every other department   could only grow in line with the growth of GDP, the reason for Cabinet restiveness last week.   If this is a surprise, it is because almost nobody seems to have come to terms with the transformation in public finances under New Labour. The combination of Brown's 'stealth' taxes, equivalent to more than 2 per cent of GDP, sticking to the Conservatives' spending plans for the first two years of this parliament, economic growth of close to 2 per cent instead of recession in 1999, the fall in unemployment and continuing low inflation has been stunning. The current budget surplus last year was 7bn; it will more than double by 2003.   Indeed if the long run economic growth rate is the 2.5 per cent now assumed by the Treasury, then as the TUC calculated in its submission to the Treasury's Spending Review last week, public spending could be raised another 12bn by 2004 and, on my calculations, to the necessary 17bn for the NHS by 2006 - and still leave the 7bn safety margin Brown had last year.   If growth turns out lower, then the NHS budget can be protected by running down the safety margin; and in an economic downturn borrowing is allowed even under Brown's rules. A European class health service is ours for the having - and without raising taxes.   The Conservative proposition that the alternative can be achieved through private insurance is for the birds and, while New Labour retreats and tem porises in so many areas of policy, it is good to see some iron in its soul over private medical insurance. It is expensive, focused on those who are good medical risks, and rarely extends to the over-75s who are most in need. Worse, even if it worked in building up the private sector, it would have the perverse result of driving up the NHS's cost as private contractors bid up wages to attract the limited number of trained staff.   But the proof is in the pudding. Tax relief on medical insurance for the over-60s was introduced in 1990; but by 1997, when Labour abolished it, only 1 per cent more of the over-60s had taken advantage of the tax break. Moreover as the human genome project is completed, we will soon know each individual's DNA structure and predicted health experience; in this emerging world private insurance is madness, because those known to be poor risks will simply not be able to insure themselves at a reasonable premium. Poor Liam Fox, the Shadow Health Secretary, is stuck with a ludicrous, provenly unworkable policy that is out of kilter with the times - the mirror image of Labour's 1983 far-fetched commitment to extend nationalisation to promote economic efficiency.   The only way to fund the NHS is through general taxation or comprehensive social insurance; the hypothecated health tax is another blind alley. If all NHS spending is dependent on a stand-alone or hypothecated tax, then its revenues will go up and down with the economic cycle; if only part is hypothecated, then by the second or third year it becomes impossible to disentangle what is new and what is old money.   On the NHS New Labour is making a stand. What it needs to do next is to drop building privately financed hospitals with fewer beds, genuinely end the internal market and redress the system's disgraceful lack accountability - and we really could start cheering.","The ID-cards vote passed: however angry Labour MPs are at this succession of pointless provocations inflicted on them, there is sensible a limit to how much damage they will inflict on themselves. Plenty of them have much to fear in their own constituencies in this low season for Labour.Those who did spend a freezing wet weekend in Blackpool found the spring conference pretty dismal and dispiriting. It was planned as a rip-roaring celebration of Labour's glorious centenary, but few people came; there were few MPs, a smattering of ministers drafted in, and the press room was bare. Many constituency parties sent no delegates.The frail state of the grassroots was whispered often in the Winter Gardens. Hazel Blears and John Prescott, trying to bounce the party into a semblance of life with defibrillator jolts of demented optimism, rashly opined that parties which wither at the roots will die at the top. With most big cities lost and a massacre of remaining councils expected at the May elections, some constituency parties that have recently lost their MP, their council and most councillors are struggling to sustain the will to live. Now add in the Dunfermline result and it's not surprising that so few went to Blackpool. As the leadership interregnum drags on, it saps the blood of the party.Tony Blair turned in a below-par speech. But even belowpar and fading in power to convince, every time he steps up to a lectern he reminds them all of his political genius. It is the same in the Commons: he stands amid swelling backbench rebellion, yet on Wednesday mornings he can rouse his party to whooping glee as he lands punches on the bench opposite, reminding his own that they may miss him when he's gone. With all that vim and verve, no wonder he can't let go. So much still to do, so much to stop his successor doing.It is human instinct to clutch after immortality, leaving a footstep in the shifting sand. But political leaders crave it with unnatural passion. Blair is trying to force his legacy on to his successor, fixing Gordon Brown's feet in concrete into his own footsteps. The so-called ""dual prime minister"" scenario described by Charles Clarke looks more like the grizzly embrace of death, the dying man holding the future leader in a deadly grip with his last gasp.In this terminal phase, Brown has no option but to obey. So out he goes to bat for the ID cards he used to think wildly too expensive. In his speech yesterday on security, he even made a reasonable stab at pretending a pressing need for the ""glorification of terrorism"" clause, which virtually no one in the Commons believes. His speeches are taking a Churchillian turn as he reprises his Britishness theme, calling for ceremonies in every constituency for Veterans' Day and new cadet schemes to instil military discipline in state-school pupils. ""We will not yield, relax, rest, become complacent or lower our guard but will use every means, every necessary resource..."" and more, to fight terror.The daily taunts from the Tories (and some Blairites) that Brown will abandon ""reform"" to lead Labour back to its dark days of producer interests and union power seem to be hitting their mark. In response, no flag is big enough, no trumpet loud enough, no dead hero's memorial tall enough - Brown must add to their patriotic clamour.It may not gladden the hearts of those hoping that his premiership will herald renewal, optimism and progressive enthusiasm. Every time Brown parrots the need for ""reform, reform, reform"" as defined by Blair, spirits in the party sink a bit lower. But he has no choice. He is destined to follow Blair's footsteps every inch of the way - until the old leader finally departs and discovers that no prime minister can ever command the future beyond his time.All this tells us very little of what to expect when Brown's day finally comes. Expect no more than a tiny flash of the cardinal's red lining in what he says now. Whether once in power he will ever give more than the odd tantalising glimpse, it's hard to know. But for now he has no choice but tough talking. The success of New Labour was built on the ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"" slogan that Brown himself devised. Unless Labour can prove itself as patriotic, as ready to fight and as ready to punish wrongdoers as the Tories, it will lose, lose and lose again. True, Blair has taken this game into extreme overkill, fighting more wars and locking up more criminals than any other government. But no Labour leader can survive if they fail the ""toughness"" test.With Brown, more lies beneath the rhetoric. Everyone is for ""reform"": he hints that his might be of a different hue. Tucked into yesterday's tough speech on security was a balancing thoughtfulness on stronger democratic accountability and shoring up civil liberties, and a seriousness about rights, with radical constitutional proposals to come. There are layers of ideas wrapped inside his flag as he strives to reclaim patriotism and Britishness for the progressive cause. It sounds so counterintuitive and unconvincing to many Labour ears that it may be a hopeless task - but it does make him unassailable by the Tories. He promises more optimistic themes in speeches to follow - easing the hardship of the lives of those ""hardworking"" families so often extolled by politicians, with more to come on social justice, children and opportunity.But he can say little while cemented into the Blair footprints. Hints and briefings are not much to go on, leaving his party clutching at straws: some will point despairingly at Brown's ultra-caution, secretiveness and failure to castigate boardroom greed. The economic dysfunction caused by gross income inequality never draws a murmur of disapproval. Some doubters worry it will be more of the same, but without Blair's magic appeal to the middle classes.Just wait until he gets his freedom, say his supporters. There will be a cornucopia of surprises, an opening up of government in a style to confound his critics. Purpose, drive and dynamism will bring the renewal this party needs.Whichever it is to be, even those wary of Brown now join his enthusiasts in just wanting to get the waiting over. At Blackpool I stopped 15 local delegates in a row, including some Labour party stewards. That's hardly a significant sample, but every single one said unequivocally that Blair should go by the summer and let the party start again at the autumn conference. Until he goes this will remain a fractious party in a state of suspended animation."
1,"It is a gulf of understanding wider than the Atlantic. Worldly, cynical Europeans just don't get American idealism over democracy, especially if it comes from the warmongers of the Bush administration. But Democrats have the same virus. Whatever the hypocrisies and inadequacies, the American political class talk democracy and freedom with an enthusiasm that cannot be denied.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was at it again last week, announcing the biggest-ever shake-up of the US diplomatic corps. Hundreds of American diplomats are to be shifted from their 'comfortable' postings in Europe and relocated to 'hardship' jobs in the Middle East and Asia, notably India and China, where they are going to undertake 'transformational diplomacy' to promulgate the values of democracy. Every city of more than a million people should have a formal American diplomatic presence, she volunteered, missionaries for the democratic gospel.Your first reaction is probably like mine. After Iraq, you would have thought that the US would have learned that exporting ideas like democracy is likely to backfire. Democracy has to grow from within a national community rather than be imposed from outside and unless buttressed by supporting institutions, culture and social factors, not least a middle class, is likely to fail. The idea that proselytising American diplomats are somehow going to change these basic rules is the arrogance of the neoconservatives taken to self-parody.And yet. Suppose you took the unsurprising view that China and India are going to become economic superpowers during the next 50 years and that the growing dependence of the industrialised West on Middle Eastern oil is set to grow. Suppose you also believed that there is strong evidence that democratic regimes perform better economically, socially and as international partners than authoritarian ones. Invasion or quasi-imperial direction of the Middle East or Asia is impossible; any lingering ambitions have been dispelled by Iraq. How, then, to ensure that the international framework remains peaceful and the oil continues to flow? The only viable option is to do all you can to promote democracy.Nor is it such a stupid idea, for all its idealism and apparent disconnect from reality. There is a burgeoning interest not just from the right in the US, but from the left, in how democracy sustains economic and social development that goes well beyond the homilies of George Bush. Take, for example, The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace, written by the Open Society Institute's Morton Halperin together with Joseph T Siegle and Michael M Weinstein. Its commitment to democracy puts Bush in the shade, yet the Open Society Institute's backer is George Soros, who is probably George Bush's richest and best-known enemy.Democratic states, and states moving towards democracy, tend to have more interests involved in government decision-making, to be more open and to have more accountability. Their institutions may be rudimentary but over a period of decades, they tend to manage their resources more effectively and better accommodate themselves to necessary economic and social changes.Halperin and his co-writers test the thesis every which way. They find, for example, that among poor countries, since 1960, poor democracies have grown 50 per cent more rapidly on average. Thus the Baltic countries, Botswana, Costa Rica, Ghana and Senegal have done very much better than, say, Angola, Syria, Uzbekistan or Zimbabwe. 'Ninety-five per cent of the worst economic performances over the past 40 years,' they write, 'were overseen by non-democratic governments.'The numbers are hard to dispute. It even seems that democratising countries are less vulnerable both to internal and external conflict. In sub-Saharan Africa, democratisers have been half as likely to experience civil conflict as others. Public accountability, the rule of law, checks and balances on arbitrary government, a free press, voting and independent trade unions all demonstrably produce better economies and societies. The only exception to this worldwide rule is in parts of Asia, with the success of authoritarian Singapore and communist China. Against that, democratic Japan, South Korea, Thailand and now India are tribute to the Open Society Institute's rules working.Even Singapore, like Hong Kong, has the British legacy of an independent judiciary. China is the genuine exception, but my view is that if it wants to carry on growing, it, too, will have to make itself more democratic soon.The hardening cross-party American attitude is hard to dispute; the issue is how to advance the cause. Support from the US necessarily discredits as American puppets those who make the argument for democracy. The best route is to practise what the West preaches, back it with aid and show countries desperate to alleviate their poverty that the evidence is that a deepening of their nascent democratic structures will deliver what they want.Europeans certainly sign up for the first propositions, but we instinctively recoil from the idea we should become intellectual crusaders for democracy. There is not the same inquisitive interest in the argument: who in Britain would write in the same vein as Halperin and co or attract the same political support?But standing back is neither honourable nor in our interests. The US has been so compromised by Iraq that it no longer gets a hearing, but on the wider case for democracy, and for advancing it as best we can, I've begun to think it's unambiguously right.","The most important political event last week for Britain did not take place at the Labour party conference in Brighton, but in Travis County, Texas. District Attorney Ronnie Earle charged the second most powerful man in the United States, Tom DeLay, with criminal conspiracy. DeLay resigned as the majority leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives while he fights the case, a stunning political setback.American conservatism that has shaped American and British politics for 20 years has been holed below the waterline. It will take a lot more to sink it, but DeLay's indictment is symptomatic of a conservative over-reach and endemic corruption that will trigger, at the very least, a retreat and maybe even more. One-Nation Tories and honest-to-God Labour politicians can take some succour; the right-wing wind that has blown across the Atlantic for nearly a generation is about to ease. Hypocrisies have been exposed. The discourse in British politics is set to change.The story begins in the murky world of campaign finance and the grey area of quasi-corruption, kickbacks and personal favours that now define the American political system. American politicians need ever more cash to fight their political campaigns and gerrymander their constituencies, so creating the political truth that incumbents rarely lose. US corporations are the consistent suppliers of the necessary dollars and Republican politicians increasingly are the principal beneficiaries. Complicated rules exist to try to ensure the relationship between companies and politicians is as much at arm's length as possible; the charge against DeLay is that he drove a coach and horses through the rules.If DeLay were another Republican politician or even a typical majority leader of the House, the political world could shrug its shoulders. Somebody got caught, but little will change. But DeLay is very different. He is the Republican paymaster, one of the authors of the K Street Project and the driving force behind a vicious, organised demonisation and attempted marginalisation of Democrats that for sheer, unabashed political animus is unlike anything else witnessed in an advanced democracy. Politicians fight their political foes by fair means or foul, but trying to exterminate them is new territory.The K Street Project is little known outside the Washington beltway and its effectiveness as a political stratagem is only possible because of the unique importance of campaign finance to American politics. DeLay, together with Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and some conservative activists, notably the ubiquitous Grover Norquist who runs the anti-state, anti-tax lobby group 'Americans for Tax Reform', conceived the notion 10 years ago that they should use the Republican majority in the House as a lever to ensure that the lobbyists, law firms and trade associations that inhabit Washington's K Street, heart of the industry, should only employ Republicans or sympathisers. To be a Democrat was to bear the mark of Cain; K Street was to be a Democrat-free zone.This, if it could be pulled off, would have multiple pay-backs. Special-interest groups and companies have always greased the palms of American law-makers and because of lack of party discipline, they have had to grease Democrat and Republican palms alike to get the legislation they wanted. DeLay's ambition was to construct such a disciplined Republican party that lobbyists would not need Democrats, and so create an inside track in which the only greased palms from legislators to lobbyists would be Republican.Lobbyists, law firms and trade associations should be told not to employ Democrats, so progressively excluding them from access to the lucrative channels of campaign finance. Democrats would become both poorer and politically diminished at a stroke and the Republicans would become richer and politically hegemonic.It has worked. The most influential Washington lobbyist is Barbour, Griffiths and Rogers; it employs not a single Democrat. Last year, in a classic operation, House Republicans let the Motion Picture Association of America (the film industry lobby group) know that appointing a Democrat, Dan Glickman, as its head would mean $1.5 billion of tax relief for the film industry was now in peril. Glickman staffed up the MPAA with Republicans, but the threat remains. In 2003, the Republican National Committee could claim that 33 of the top 36 top-level K Street positions were in Republican hands. Today, it's even closer to a clean sweep.Corporations get their rewards. The oil and gas industry now gives 80 per cent of its campaign cash to Republicans (20 years ago, the split was roughly 50-50), and influence on this year's energy bill was a classic sting. American petrol can now contain a suspected carcinogen; operators of US natural-gas wells can contaminate water aquifers to improve the yields from the wells; the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is open to oil exploration - concessions all created by DeLay's inside track. And to provide ideological juice, there's a bevy of think-tanks, paid for from the same web of contributions, cranking out the justification that the 'state' and 'regulation' are everywhere and always wrong.But central to the operation is DeLay's mastery of the party in the House. To get two more Republican votes in his pocket, he organised a gerrymander in Texas to create two more seats in the 2004 election and gave the Republican campaign there some extra campaign money. The trouble was, alleges the DA, the cash from Washington originally came from Texan companies, which are forbidden directly to back individual candidates and that DeLay devised the illegal scheme.DeLay vigorously insists he's the victim of a partisan stitch-up, surely a case of the biter bit? Yet the scope for misdirection of political funds is huge. Michael Scanlon, DeLay's director of communications for six years, is under criminal investigation together with partner Jack Abramoff for the way they used $66 million, paid by 11 casino-owning native American tribes over three years into their K Street operation, and which seems to have financed, among other extraordinary expenditures, a DeLay golf trip to Scotland. Nobody checks too much on how their money is deployed as long as it brings results - access, tax breaks and legislative concessions. DeLay, Scanlon and Abramoff belong to the same culture.In Congress, moderate Republicans don't want guilt by association and companies value their reputation. The K Street Project stinks, along with all those associated with it. So far, the US media have been supine. DeLay's tentacles, and those of Karl Rove, Bush's top political adviser, have cowed media owners into the same compliance; if they want favours, best advance the Republican cause like Murdoch's Fox News. American newsrooms are fearful places.But DeLay's indictment breaks back the dam. US politics moves in cycles. Once it was Republicans who were going to clean up corrupt Democrat Washington; now Democrats can champion the same cause. Nor can the media afford to be on the side of the Old Corruption; it's bad for business. The wheel is turning, an important moment both sides of the Atlantic."

If elections are meant to bring an infusion of energy to the body politic, this one, seat for seat, was the deadest in living memory. This is not another treatise on the apathy of the voters, but is prompted by something scarier: the desiccated inanition, the droning indecision, of ministers. What a second dose of power seems to have done to them is not renew their purpose but redouble the unbearable caution which, in the first term, persuaded us to suspend every expectation. No sooner have they got back than they've started again on the long haul through the cliches of postponement until the end of the day when the dust never settles. Consider Stephen Byers, secretary of state for transport and a few other things. On Sunday, he had eight minutes on David Frost's sofa to state his case. His field of responsibility is in massive crisis. Transport affects the lives of far more people than either health or education. Rail service is collapsing, roads are slowing down, the London tube is going nowhere. We need to know what Byers will do. Instead we heard a man supremely complacent in the utter emptiness of what he had to say.  Asked about the trains, he admitted things were grim. But he was going to take command. ""It's my responsibility to change that round and really give the industry a sense of focus and do the simple things,"" he grandly said. ""Get trains running on time, safely, and comfortable. That's what the travelling public want."" This was a startling insight. But how would he get the railway people to comply? ""By saying to them they've got to focus on delivering the 10-year plan,"" he puffed. ""And it's got to be done quickly, because travellers were fed up with the industry blaming other people and not taking responsibility.""  This minister knows plenty about not taking responsibility. It is the kernel of his purpose. He was going to get on to Railtrack, he said. Railtrack would be pulling the operating companies together ""to work out a new way forward"". And Byers himself? The imperious command to Railtrack went forth from the Sunday sofa. They must, the minister insisted, ""do that sooner rather than later"". And if this didn't work? ""There'll be more announcements in the next few weeks about the powers that we are using.""  Not even the scandalous million-pound pay-off to Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's disgraced former chairman, could stimulate what might remain of Stephen Byers' capacity to share the indignation of the millions of travellers who now depend on him. When Frost put the question to him, he ran like a neutered rabbit to his burrow. That's not an issue for the secretary of state, he burbled. It was up to the shareholders. But isn't the government, in a way, the biggest shareholder? He was proud enough to say that ""we are making significant investment in Railtrack"", yet didn't seem to see any connection between this fact and the need to account, as a Labour minister, for Corbett's disgustingly generous treatment.  On petrol, we were offered the astounding dictum that ""the British public will not tolerate a price for fuel which is excessive"". On the tube, ""we need to rule out privatisation"" - as if anyone was any longer contemplating it. Throughout the piece, Byers sat in perfect comfort, oblivious to the embarrassment he deserved to feel, no doubt thinking he was doing well, shameless in his refusal to engage with a single policy question, unaware that he epitomised the worst of everything about New Labour: patronising, secretive, indecisive, terrified of breaking with the party line - a line whose commonest ingredient is that nothing should be said.  Watching this performance, I saw more clearly some of the characteristics of this government which, during the second term, seem likely to make us love it less and less.  First, it contains few ministers of any scale. Here was an experienced Cabinet minister who didn't have a single interesting idea about his new job. Like most of them, he is driven by the short-term news agenda, which means essentially remaining in defensive mode at all times. It's all that bothers him. Robin Cook and Clare Short rise above this, and David Blunkett may learn to. But Lord Chancellor Irvine has gone silent for years. The Byers approach, positively yearning for grey anonymity, is the template. The notion of the politician as leader, as challenger of received opinion, as generator of daring debate, is unimaginable in the cohorts of New Labour.  Second, this is a style not merely encouraged but insisted on by the only two ministers who are allowed to matter, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It has been the feature of their duumvirate.Fighting the battles in the war before last, they insist especially that there must be no perceived disagreements - except the ones they can't conceal between themselves. In most departments, no minister is supposed to have an idea that one of the two duumvirs hasn't had first - or at any rate run through every kind of personal security check.  This breeds a crippling shortage of political imagination. Blairites are a generation of timid politicians. For all I know, Stephen Byers may be a one-man cauldron of creativity. But he never lets it show. The retreat into committees and commissions and proposals ""coming forward"" and plans ""we may look at"" and all the other artefacts of unripe time is a move he makes by reflex instinct.   This is the style that comes from Blair's insistence on bilateral agreement rather than collective discussion, and from Brown's tireless efforts to impose a regime of fear. The hidden presence on Frost's sofa, ensuring that Byers made a fool of himself whenever he was asked to address the voters' concerns about transport, was the chancellor of the exchequer.  Third, though, we do have to return to apathy. The low voter turnout at the election, it is sometimes said, diminished Labour's mandate. I've heard it cited as a reason for the government to resume the ultra-caution with which it conducted itself from 1997 to 2001. This seems precisely the opposite of the truth. If there's a connection, it works the other way. It's the very timidity of ministers, their corporate greyness, the fact that the Cabinet has barely two personalities to rub together, which finds its echo in the electorate. If ministers are run according to a strategy that favours robotic vacuity on the part of almost all of them, why should the voters be expected to take them seriously enough to perform their own part in the democratic process?  The Byers performance was a little Sunday insult. Evidently it's the norm we're meant to accept, from a government that faces no political pressure except that which comes from its own failure to solve problems. It doesn't enlist people's support, but treats them as the enemy, in need of reassurance without promises, and condescension without commitment. I still believe the government can do better than that. But it has to be admitted that the first four weeks have set a style that seems to say the end of the day will never really come."
1,"If there is one golden thread connecting Old and New Labour, it is the commitment to the National Health Service. There is no member of the Cabinet who does not believe in the Bevanite conception of the NHS - a service providing equality of treatment free to every Briton, regardless of age, race, class, gender or geography. Despite New Labour's temporising elsewhere, we should take it at its word on the NHS.  The problem is not the shared goal, it is the means. And here the Government's lack of an overarching philosophy and political coherence is undermining its capacity to achieve the end that it wants. Promises of more spending, shorter waiting-lists and a tougher regime for consultants are all welcome as far as they go, but the problems are much more deep-seated. The NHS is suffering a gathering crisis of legitimacy. Patients and the public at large want a voice and a systematic framework in which they can trust that high quality health care is assured over time.   Yet what is on offer is an increasingly politicised service where effective decision-making is still tightly held at the centre and where some of the policies, notably the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) as it operates in health, are undermining the equality and evenness of provision that the Government seeks.   Three recent events underline the problem; more lie ahead. There is the exercise in public consultation - the so-called health census - to inform the National Plan for Health that has been exposed as little more than a PR stunt. There is the extraordinary fight to prevent the downgrading of Kidderminster General Hospital (part of a larger PFI deal for the nearby Worcester Royal Infirmary), where 19 out of 42 seats on the local district council are held by independent, newly elected councillors who, as members of 'Health Concern', are pledged to fight the plans and are bringing their protest to London next week in a street march. And there is the growing public dismay at medical incompetence, highlighted again by last week's Ritchie Report into Rodney Ledward, the Kent consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician who, over a 16-year career, maimed and harmed any number of women through botched operations.   At first glance, these cases might seem unconnected, yet what binds them together is the great accountability gap that sits in the NHS as a brooding cancer. As long as it remains unaddressed, it will expose the contradictions that beset the Government's NHS policies.   The unprecedented scale of the consultation exercise being mounted before the publication of the National Plan for Health in July is a tacit recognition of the accountability gap. The country's surgeries and supermarkets have been flooded by 12 million leaflets inviting us to identify the three key things we want from the NHS. These have to be completed and sent back by Monday at the latest, a week from start to finish.   However, as Mori's Bob Worcester has said, this is not a serious exercise in finding out what the public wants or the trade-offs it might make between varying claims on NHS resources; that would require intense quantitative and qualitative research. Rather, it is a high-profile exercise in trying to demonstrate that the Government is 'listening', even though it knows the results will be unrepresentative and profoundly compromised by the tight time-scale. But it needs to show that readiness because nothing less will do in today's democratic climate.   Automatic deference to authority is steadily weakening. We live in more democratic times, where everybody believes their voice should be heard. Legitimacy, by government, line manager or NHS consultant has to be earned. The Ledward case, together with the palpable weakness of both NHS managers and the General Medical Council alike in dealing with this rogue consultant, is another nail in that coffin.   Ledward, like Harold Shipman, may be an exception, but the reality is that the system did not catch either early enough and in today's climate such deficiencies are no longer acceptable. The Ritchie Report assembles an impressive list of reforms, bolstering NHS complaints procedures which should be extended to the private sector and calling for beefed-up powers for the General Medical Council. And the Government has responded by saying either reform is in train or it will be.   But as with the census, the larger democratic point is missed. The reason why the health ombudsman is weak, complaints procedures are feeble and regulation is delegated to the medical profession in the shape of the General Medical Council is not some accident - it is because the British doctrine is that accountability lies with the Minister in Parliament and that any other mechanism might challenge that ultimate authority. Thus the ombudsman is kept weak because he or she might challenge the authority of the Minister. There is a linear connection between British constitutional arrangements and Ledward's capacity to practise.   This doctrine is not going to be challenged by New Labour. Instead, the party rel ishes the control it confers; the centre can thus control the terms of the health debate while offering a patina of accountability through consultation exercises like the national census or patients' focus groups. This allows polices like the PFI to be protected, which would not otherwise survive the scrutiny of the democratic rough house.   Yet Kidderminster gives the lie even to this proposition. To scale down Kidderminster General so that it no longer offers in-patient beds, and diverting patients to Worcester, whose Royal Infirmary is being replaced with a PFI hospital that can only afford three-fifths of the existing acute beds, is outrageous. This is not a plan to improve Worcester's health provision that has been driven by Worcester's health needs, settled by open argument. Rather, it is a top-down scheme imposed upon the county by the exigencies of offering private contractors their appropriate financial returns within impossibly tight public-sector expenditure constraints.   Yet the democratic voice cannot be suppressed. Alan Milburn dares not visit Worcester for fear the cameras might catch him with the protesters; next week, the stakes will be higher again as they carry their protest to London. And this is not the Socialist Workers Party; this is middle England in force.   The Government really does want to deliver a better NHS. New money, new schemes and renegotiating the deal with consultants are helpful, but they will not crack the problem. To do that it must close the accountability deficit, with all that implies - delegating power, toughening up regulations, offering elections to health boards and accepting that if the PFI changes the fundamental character of the hospital service, then it must be reformed. It means nothing less than a democratic constitution for the health service, the case the commission I chaired recommended six weeks ago. Our case gets stronger by the day.","B> The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday May 16 2004</B><BR><BR>  The article below  suggests that the Great Exhibition of 1851 was in Crystal Palace. To clarify: the Great Exhibition was held in Hyde Park; the Crystal Palace that was its centrepiece was afterwards moved to the London borough that took its name.   <BR><BR>  <B><HR size=""1""></HR></B><BR><BR>  When an economy with 1.3 billion people doubles in size every 10 years, it is likely sooner or later to have an impact on the rest of us. Last week, British home-owners and motorists began to feel what making room for China will mean, following rises in both mortgage rates and petrol prices. Within a decade it promises to be the world's second economy after the United States, pulling more than 300 million Chinese out of abject poverty. It is an achievement that no other country has ever matched - and a profound challenge for the rest of the world. Its exports, for example, have doubled in less than five years. The 'miracle' Japanese economy of the 1970s managed the same feat in seven years; Germany took ten years in the 1960s; it took Britain 12 years after 1838 culminating in the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace - the proudest moment in our industrial history - to do the same.  That is happening in China now. The Pearl River Delta just beyond Hong Kong can justly claim the mantle of being the new workshop of the world - a stunning maze of industrial plants that combines cheap labour, high skills and frontier technology in an unbeatable combination. But Shanghai and Beijing are no slouches either. This is the country, for example, where Volkswagen now sells more cars than it does in Germany.  China's boom literally needs fuelling, and this year it has become the world's second largest importer of oil after the US. Nor does its appetite stop there. It buys massive amounts of copper, cement and iron.  If you want to understand why commodity prices have jumped 60 per cent over the past two years, and why the oil price is now hovering at just over $40 a barrel, think China. The good news is that higher commodity prices mean the world economy is strengthening, propelled by recovery in the US and the continuing growth in China; the bad news is that the impact on inflation is unavoidable, explicitly cited by the Bank of England for its decision to hike interest rates by a quarter of 1 per cent last week. The high price for a litre of unleaded petrol - now around 80p - with more increases certain, is part of the same picture.  Oil has doubled in price since December 2001. It may in real terms still be well below its all-time high, reached in 1979, but oil price hikes of this type have in the past always been associated with economic slowdowns and rising prices. Warwick University's Professor Andrew Oswald has established that there is a close relationship between swings in the oil price, growth and unemployment; put simply, a low oil price stimulates and a high oil price depresses, working alternatively as a kind of generalised tax cut or tax increase because oil expenditure is unavoidable. He tells me that he believes we are already in the danger zone; and if   the price stays above $40 a slowdown in growth and pick up in unemployment, most acute in the US but impacting across the west, is inevitable.  In other words last week the world economy crossed an important line: the good side of a rising oil price - that it spells economic growth - began to be offset by the ominous height it was reaching. It may of course fall back, but its hard to imagine it will fall very far; China's demand will see to that.  On the other hand, what is spooking the oil world is obvious. If a panicked US withdraws from a disintegrating Iraq over the next six months with mounting attacks by suicide bombers on oil installations in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, then oil supply, rather than rising to check higher oil prices, could actually fall. Then the oil price could go higher still - and interest rates in Britain, expected in any case to rise still further, would clearly top 5 per cent.  In which case the debate about whether the British housing market is going to slow down gently or come back to earth with a thump would move decisively in favour of the pessimists. House prices have doubled in five years and it is only cheap money and low mortgage service costs that justify the massive departure from their long term relationship with average earnings. A return to the old relationship implies a fall in house prices of around a quarter, a risk which, while obvious, has until now seemed small while money remains cheap. Suddenly events in the Middle East combined with the China boom raise the probability that the British housing market could become very sticky indeed.  And China's growth, and its appetite for oil, are not going to disappear. For as Joshua Ramo, former foreign editor of  Time and author of an intriguing pamphlet, 'The Beijing Consensus', published by the Foreign Policy Centre next week, argues, too many interpreters of China try to understand it in western terms.  China is not an economic bubble like the dot.com boom or parts of the British housing market that is about to be pricked, so relieving the pressure on world oil prices. Its economic growth will doubtless quicken and slow in pace - and after the hectic growth of the past few years some easing may be inevitable - but the direction is clear. This is a continent that is being opened up and developed rather as the US was in the 19th century; its momentum is just as inexorable - but its development, while breathtakingly friendly to capitalism, is very distinctive and Chinese.  It is a new economic model combining capitalist dynamism but guided by a state constantly aware of the need to raise living standards and the quality of life for literally hundreds of millions of people - or it will suffer a crisis of legitimacy.  Wen Jia-bao, the Chinese prime minister who visits London on Monday, does not talk about economic growth but about co-ordinated economic development. The scale of the infrastructure investment - whether oil pipelines, dock installations, motorways and airports - makes your head spin, but it is all part of an overall purpose; to drive Chinese economic development.  If fundamentalism of the left has been discarded, so, Ramo argues, has fundamentalism of the right - the so-called Washington consensus. The developing world is now looking to China as an exemplar of a new 'Beijing consensus', deploying capitalism not as an end in its own right - but as a means to an end. It is because privatisation works that you do it; it is because financial deregulation does not that you have to proceed with caution. Above all invest in education.  China, in short, is a world event - a continent on the move with a distinct approach to capitalism. Its achievement is already remarkable, and its impact on a hitherto sluggish world economy entirely welcome. But the Chinese did not reckon on Messrs Bush and Blair and what now looks like the worst post-Second World War foreign policy error.  Torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners captured the headlines last week, but another and associated drama was playing itself out in the world's oil markets. Iraq has to be internationalised and normalised fast - and oil prices must be managed downwards. The stakes get higher by the week. China could step in; but will it?"

Our case gets stronger by the day.","Dead children always look so beautiful. Victoria Climbi's curls are held with yellow ties, and her smile is hopeful. Lauren Wright has blonde bunches caught in rosebud ribbons. The girls' school photos, shot in a rare instant of peace or pretence, bear no relationship to the reality of their lives. One child was left in a sack of excrement in a cold bath; the other was pulverised like steak on a butcher's slab and left to die. In the face of such incomprehensible brutality, the pictures tell a simpler horror story. A murderous great-aunt adjusted the yellow hair ties. A killer stepmother fixed the rosebud ribbons. The clash of normality and evil appals and also, in some curious way, absolves us. We are detached and at a loss to comprehend.  Such wickedness, we think, does not brush ordinary lives. It does now. The Climbi inquiry is a recital of blight and official blindness in the anonymous inner city. The case of Lauren Wright demonstrates how a peaceful Norfolk village, with a church, an ivy-clad pub and 300 inhabitants, can double as a torture chamber. Neighbours and teachers looked on as Lauren's weight fell and her bruises spread. Tracey Wright, a playground helper, felt sufficiently emboldened by communitarian spirit to brutalise her in public and encourage her own children to spit in their stepsister's face.   What sort of a woman commits such atrocities? Cruel, sadistic, not clever but very cunning. And familiar. The monstrous mother has existed since the time of Euripides and before. While Tracey Wright may not qualify as a modern   Medea, she is a recognisable figure in the canon of evil. Nor is there anything new in the modern continuum of child torture. Every week in Britain, at least one child dies at the hands of a parent or carer. As the NSPCC points out, the roll call of child killing has continued uninterrupted since Maria Colwell was murdered in the early 70s. For all the reforms and promises, we have made no impact at all.   But the culture that spawns viciousness evolves in terrifying ways. It seems unbelievable that those who watched Lauren suffer could shuffle their feet, like awkward spectators at a stranger's deathbed, as a child was inched towards her grave. It is unspeakable, too, that social services should lace their culpability with such cynicism. The official valediction to brief lives now contains two strands. First, supply extra money, or expect more deaths. The second message, whispered as the Climbi inquiry continues, is that professionals should not have their errors paraded, lest potential care workers shun this blighted system.   Such arguments brand at-risk children as economic bait. It is, however, true that the Government is so miserly on child protection that English authorities have overspent by 500 million this year, just to provide the thin back-up that allowed Lauren and Victoria's killings. Diverting money into favoured, and successful, Government initiatives, such as Sure Start, means less for basic services. Promises to eradicate child poverty, linked closely to neglect, sound hopeful, but 4.3 million British children remain poor. The Prime Minister lauds America, where the impoverished black child may aspire to high office. We shall see soon how the Colin Powell model will play out here.   Poverty is not the only issue. Nor is a pernicious minority of brutes who torture children the sole problem, though it is the least tractable. Michael Stone, the murderer of Lin and Megan Russell and a man no doubt immortalised some where in a sweet-faced school snapshot, was beaten by his stepfather at the age of one and abused by social workers. We understand how to create monsters. We do not know how to redeem them. Notions of parenting classes for the inadequate are little more than a sop for middle class do-gooders with the warm idea that cruelty is amenable to the intervention of a Dr Spockish government.   But the state is a dreadful parent. It is responsible for care home scandals. It presides,  in loco parentis, over the young offenders' institutions that, for all the warnings, still corrupt and kill. We weep, rightly, for murdered toddlers, but children discovered hanging in a Feltham cell die without public lament or remark. What binds such victims to each other, and to all those whose lives will never be corroded by cruelty, is absence of power.   Adults see children as their property. The law is cavalier. A child can be arrested and strip-searched at 10 but not interviewed by police until he or she is 14. Children can drink alcohol at five but not buy a pet kitten before the age of 12. It took until last year for the Home Office to issue guidance that child prostitutes were abuse victims, not criminals. A few weeks ago Scotland announced its plan to outlaw smacking for the under-threes. Westminster proposals are imminent, and child protection charities fear that a government that recently sanctioned smacking by childminders might restrict the ban to babies only.   Outlawing smacking altogether is imperative. Those who hesitated to report Tracey Wright as she went about the legalised business of battering her child might have thought again. Such a ban would also impact on parents, Blair and   Blunkett included, who see no great harm in a remedial swipe. It would symbolise a fairer world for children and end the idea that Article 12 of the Human Rights Convention is, like recorder lessons and broccoli, desirable but inessential.   A lack of rights for children drives society's failings. That absence feeds the confidence of torturers, the apathy of protectors and the vagueness of government reformers. It underpins the cruel practice of keeping children with their birth parents when all reason and humanity demands their removal. It genuflects to the madness of a system in which it is legal to assault a child but not a grown-up. It makes adults, the monstrous and the kind alike, complicit in neglect.   So, reform the child care system. Have a Children's Commissioner, as the NSPCC and others demand. But a slicker, more accountable structure will not be enough. We have the worst child poverty and infant mortality rates in Europe. A quarter of recorded rape victims are children. One in five children is mentally ill. Another child will be killed by a parent before this week is over. The charge sheet, if there ever is one, is likely to say manslaughter, not murder. The presumption is that the premeditated slaughter of a child is a lesser crime. What are the remedies against such horrors?   'We deserve to know why,' Lauren's MP said, as she demanded an inquiry into her death. But we do know why. And the lesson, not yet absorbed, of Victoria's and Lauren's deaths is that children, not adults, are the deserving ones. They need more rights, more legal protection, more compassion. They need more than old stereotypes of evil and of innocence. They need solutions to disaster that go beyond a tired litany of official regret laced with laments on overwork. They deserve better than a society that turns its back on the ugly fate of living children while weeping at the beauty of the dead."

But Shanghai and Beijing are no slouches either. This is the country, for example, where Volkswagen now sells more cars than it does in Germany.  China's boom literally needs fuelling, and this year it has become the world's second largest importer of oil after the US. Nor does its appetite stop there. It buys massive amounts of copper, cement and iron.

Patients and the public at large want a voice and a systematic framework in which they can trust that high quality health care is assured over time.   Yet what is on offer is an increasingly politicised service where effective decision-making is still tightly held at the centre and where some of the policies, notably the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) as it operates in health, are undermining the equality and evenness of provision that the Government seeks.   Three recent events underline the problem; more lie ahead. There is the exercise in public consultation - the so-called health census - to inform the National Plan for Health that has been exposed as little more than a PR stunt. There is the extraordinary fight to prevent the downgrading of Kidderminster General Hospital (part of a larger PFI deal for the nearby Worcester Royal Infirmary), where 19 out of 42 seats on the local district council are held by independent, newly elected councillors who, as members of 'Health Concern', are pledged to fight the plans and are bringing their protest to London next week in a street march. And there is the growing public dismay at medical incompetence, highlighted again by last week's Ritchie Report into Rodney Ledward, the Kent consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician who, over a 16-year career, maimed and harmed any number of women through botched operations.   At first glance, these cases might seem unconnected, yet what binds them together is the great accountability gap that sits in the NHS as a brooding cancer. As long as it remains unaddressed, it will expose the contradictions that beset the Government's NHS policies.   The unprecedented scale of the consultation exercise being mounted before the publication of the National Plan for Health in July is a tacit recognition of the accountability gap. The country's surgeries and supermarkets have been flooded by 12 million leaflets inviting us to identify the three key things we want from the NHS. These have to be completed and sent back by Monday at the latest, a week from start to finish.   However, as Mori's Bob Worcester has said, this is not a serious exercise in finding out what the public wants or the trade-offs it might make between varying claims on NHS resources; that would require intense quantitative and qualitative research. Rather, it is a high-profile exercise in trying to demonstrate that the Government is 'listening', even though it knows the results will be unrepresentative and profoundly compromised by the tight time-scale. But it needs to show that readiness because nothing less will do in today's democratic climate.   Automatic deference to authority is steadily weakening. We live in more democratic times, where everybody believes their voice should be heard. Legitimacy, by government, line manager or NHS consultant has to be earned. The Ledward case, together with the palpable weakness of both NHS managers and the General Medical Council alike in dealing with this rogue consultant, is another nail in that coffin.   Ledward, like Harold Shipman, may be an exception, but the reality is that the system did not catch either early enough and in today's climate such deficiencies are no longer acceptable. The Ritchie Report assembles an impressive list of reforms, bolstering NHS complaints procedures which should be extended to the private sector and calling for beefed-up powers for the General Medical Council. And the Government has responded by saying either reform is in train or it will be.   But as with the census, the larger democratic point is missed. The reason why the health ombudsman is weak, complaints procedures are feeble and regulation is delegated to the medical profession in the shape of the General Medical Council is not some accident - it is because the British doctrine is that accountability lies with the Minister in Parliament and that any other mechanism might challenge that ultimate authority. Thus the ombudsman is kept weak because he or she might challenge the authority of the Minister. There is a linear connection between British constitutional arrangements and Ledward's capacity to practise.   This doctrine is not going to be challenged by New Labour. Instead, the party rel ishes the control it confers; the centre can thus control the terms of the health debate while offering a patina of accountability through consultation exercises like the national census or patients' focus groups. This allows polices like the PFI to be protected, which would not otherwise survive the scrutiny of the democratic rough house.   Yet Kidderminster gives the lie even to this proposition. To scale down Kidderminster General so that it no longer offers in-patient beds, and diverting patients to Worcester, whose Royal Infirmary is being replaced with a PFI hospital that can only afford three-fifths of the existing acute beds, is outrageous. This is not a plan to improve Worcester's health provision that has been driven by Worcester's health needs, settled by open argument. Rather, it is a top-down scheme imposed upon the county by the exigencies of offering private contractors their appropriate financial returns within impossibly tight public-sector expenditure constraints.   Yet the democratic voice cannot be suppressed. Alan Milburn dares not visit Worcester for fear the cameras might catch him with the protesters; next week, the stakes will be higher again as they carry their protest to London. And this is not the Socialist Workers Party; this is middle England in force.   The Government really does want to deliver a better NHS. New money, new schemes and renegotiating the deal with consultants are helpful, but they will not crack the problem. To do that it must close the accountability deficit, with all that implies - delegating power, toughening up regulations, offering elections to health boards and accepting that if the PFI changes the fundamental character of the hospital service, then it must be reformed. It means nothing less than a democratic constitution for the health service, the case the commission I chaired recommended six weeks ago. Our case gets stronger by the day."

To clarify: the Great Exhibition was held in Hyde Park; the Crystal Palace that was its centrepiece was afterwards moved to the London borough that took its name.   <BR><BR>  <B><HR size=""1""></HR></B><BR><BR>  When an economy with 1.3 billion people doubles in size every 10 years, it is likely sooner or later to have an impact on the rest of us. Last week, British home-owners and motorists began to feel what making room for China will mean, following rises in both mortgage rates and petrol prices. Within a decade it promises to be the world's second economy after the United States, pulling more than 300 million Chinese out of abject poverty. It is an achievement that no other country has ever matched - and a profound challenge for the rest of the world. Its exports, for example, have doubled in less than five years. The 'miracle' Japanese economy of the 1970s managed the same feat in seven years; Germany took ten years in the 1960s; it took Britain 12 years after 1838 culminating in the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace - the proudest moment in our industrial history - to do the same.  That is happening in China now. The Pearl River Delta just beyond Hong Kong can justly claim the mantle of being the new workshop of the world - a stunning maze of industrial plants that combines cheap labour, high skills and frontier technology in an unbeatable combination. But Shanghai and Beijing are no slouches either. This is the country, for example, where Volkswagen now sells more cars than it does in Germany.  China's boom literally needs fuelling, and this year it has become the world's second largest importer of oil after the US. Nor does its appetite stop there. It buys massive amounts of copper, cement and iron.  If you want to understand why commodity prices have jumped 60 per cent over the past two years, and why the oil price is now hovering at just over $40 a barrel, think China. The good news is that higher commodity prices mean the world economy is strengthening, propelled by recovery in the US and the continuing growth in China; the bad news is that the impact on inflation is unavoidable, explicitly cited by the Bank of England for its decision to hike interest rates by a quarter of 1 per cent last week. The high price for a litre of unleaded petrol - now around 80p - with more increases certain, is part of the same picture.  Oil has doubled in price since December 2001. It may in real terms still be well below its all-time high, reached in 1979, but oil price hikes of this type have in the past always been associated with economic slowdowns and rising prices. Warwick University's Professor Andrew Oswald has established that there is a close relationship between swings in the oil price, growth and unemployment; put simply, a low oil price stimulates and a high oil price depresses, working alternatively as a kind of generalised tax cut or tax increase because oil expenditure is unavoidable. He tells me that he believes we are already in the danger zone; and if   the price stays above $40 a slowdown in growth and pick up in unemployment, most acute in the US but impacting across the west, is inevitable.  In other words last week the world economy crossed an important line: the good side of a rising oil price - that it spells economic growth - began to be offset by the ominous height it was reaching. It may of course fall back, but its hard to imagine it will fall very far; China's demand will see to that.  On the other hand, what is spooking the oil world is obvious. If a panicked US withdraws from a disintegrating Iraq over the next six months with mounting attacks by suicide bombers on oil installations in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, then oil supply, rather than rising to check higher oil prices, could actually fall. Then the oil price could go higher still - and interest rates in Britain, expected in any case to rise still further, would clearly top 5 per cent.  In which case the debate about whether the British housing market is going to slow down gently or come back to earth with a thump would move decisively in favour of the pessimists. House prices have doubled in five years and it is only cheap money and low mortgage service costs that justify the massive departure from their long term relationship with average earnings. A return to the old relationship implies a fall in house prices of around a quarter, a risk which, while obvious, has until now seemed small while money remains cheap. Suddenly events in the Middle East combined with the China boom raise the probability that the British housing market could become very sticky indeed.  And China's growth, and its appetite for oil, are not going to disappear. For as Joshua Ramo, former foreign editor of  Time and author of an intriguing pamphlet, 'The Beijing Consensus', published by the Foreign Policy Centre next week, argues, too many interpreters of China try to understand it in western terms.  China is not an economic bubble like the dot.com boom or parts of the British housing market that is about to be pricked, so relieving the pressure on world oil prices. Its economic growth will doubtless quicken and slow in pace - and after the hectic growth of the past few years some easing may be inevitable - but the direction is clear. This is a continent that is being opened up and developed rather as the US was in the 19th century; its momentum is just as inexorable - but its development, while breathtakingly friendly to capitalism, is very distinctive and Chinese.  It is a new economic model combining capitalist dynamism but guided by a state constantly aware of the need to raise living standards and the quality of life for literally hundreds of millions of people - or it will suffer a crisis of legitimacy.  Wen Jia-bao, the Chinese prime minister who visits London on Monday, does not talk about economic growth but about co-ordinated economic development. The scale of the infrastructure investment - whether oil pipelines, dock installations, motorways and airports - makes your head spin, but it is all part of an overall purpose; to drive Chinese economic development.  If fundamentalism of the left has been discarded, so, Ramo argues, has fundamentalism of the right - the so-called Washington consensus. The developing world is now looking to China as an exemplar of a new 'Beijing consensus', deploying capitalism not as an end in its own right - but as a means to an end. It is because privatisation works that you do it; it is because financial deregulation does not that you have to proceed with caution. Above all invest in education.  China, in short, is a world event - a continent on the move with a distinct approach to capitalism. Its achievement is already remarkable, and its impact on a hitherto sluggish world economy entirely welcome. But the Chinese did not reckon on Messrs Bush and Blair and what now looks like the worst post-Second World War foreign policy error.  Torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners captured the headlines last week, but another and associated drama was playing itself out in the world's oil markets. Iraq has to be internationalised and normalised fast - and oil prices must be managed downwards. The stakes get higher by the week. China could step in; but will it?","The Sri Lankan government may finally have beaten the Tamil Tigers, but now stands in imminent danger of defeat in the crucial battle for public opinion. Colombo needs massive international aid. It also needs to bind up the wounds of a fatally divided nation. Yet it is doing neither of those things, opting instead for the secrecy and evasion that dogged its conduct of this civil war. Does it matter, now the conflict is over, that international reporters are still cooped up in Colombo hotels, unable to visit the scene of the Tigers' last stand hundreds of miles away, or to gauge the suffering of the 200,000 or so Tamil civilians trapped by the fighting? Of course it does. This is a public relations disaster, with two fingers raised to charities, broadcasters and diplomats alike. Keeping independent journalists and UN observers far away from the action might - just - be defended while a bloody war reached a bloody conclusion. But now there are no excuses left. The world wants to see for itself. Sri Lanka, under the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, has a lousy press freedom record which would put any proper democracy to shame. Sixteen reporters and editors have died there in the past five years. Lasantha Wikremetunge, the editor of the Sunday Leader, was one such victim. He had a national and international reputation and his murder reverberated far beyond Sri Lanka. Tamil writers, like JS Tissainayagam, of OutreachSL, have been arbitrarily locked up for questioning the conduct of the war in moderate, concerned terms. Simply put, this isn't good enough for a government claiming freedom's ways or freedom's aid. It sets Rajapaksa apart from his Indian, Bangladeshi or even Pakistani neighbours, and it mocks the rule of law. Press repression and suppression has to stop. Sri Lanka once had a vibrant, often courageous press that helped define its democracy. If Rajapaksa - a lawyer himself, ironically - spurns that inheritance, then more than his country's reputation is at stake: for there is no reconciliation under cover of darkness, either."
1,"The most important political event last week for Britain did not take place at the Labour party conference in Brighton, but in Travis County, Texas. District Attorney Ronnie Earle charged the second most powerful man in the United States, Tom DeLay, with criminal conspiracy. DeLay resigned as the majority leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives while he fights the case, a stunning political setback.American conservatism that has shaped American and British politics for 20 years has been holed below the waterline. It will take a lot more to sink it, but DeLay's indictment is symptomatic of a conservative over-reach and endemic corruption that will trigger, at the very least, a retreat and maybe even more. One-Nation Tories and honest-to-God Labour politicians can take some succour; the right-wing wind that has blown across the Atlantic for nearly a generation is about to ease. Hypocrisies have been exposed. The discourse in British politics is set to change.The story begins in the murky world of campaign finance and the grey area of quasi-corruption, kickbacks and personal favours that now define the American political system. American politicians need ever more cash to fight their political campaigns and gerrymander their constituencies, so creating the political truth that incumbents rarely lose. US corporations are the consistent suppliers of the necessary dollars and Republican politicians increasingly are the principal beneficiaries. Complicated rules exist to try to ensure the relationship between companies and politicians is as much at arm's length as possible; the charge against DeLay is that he drove a coach and horses through the rules.If DeLay were another Republican politician or even a typical majority leader of the House, the political world could shrug its shoulders. Somebody got caught, but little will change. But DeLay is very different. He is the Republican paymaster, one of the authors of the K Street Project and the driving force behind a vicious, organised demonisation and attempted marginalisation of Democrats that for sheer, unabashed political animus is unlike anything else witnessed in an advanced democracy. Politicians fight their political foes by fair means or foul, but trying to exterminate them is new territory.The K Street Project is little known outside the Washington beltway and its effectiveness as a political stratagem is only possible because of the unique importance of campaign finance to American politics. DeLay, together with Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and some conservative activists, notably the ubiquitous Grover Norquist who runs the anti-state, anti-tax lobby group 'Americans for Tax Reform', conceived the notion 10 years ago that they should use the Republican majority in the House as a lever to ensure that the lobbyists, law firms and trade associations that inhabit Washington's K Street, heart of the industry, should only employ Republicans or sympathisers. To be a Democrat was to bear the mark of Cain; K Street was to be a Democrat-free zone.This, if it could be pulled off, would have multiple pay-backs. Special-interest groups and companies have always greased the palms of American law-makers and because of lack of party discipline, they have had to grease Democrat and Republican palms alike to get the legislation they wanted. DeLay's ambition was to construct such a disciplined Republican party that lobbyists would not need Democrats, and so create an inside track in which the only greased palms from legislators to lobbyists would be Republican.Lobbyists, law firms and trade associations should be told not to employ Democrats, so progressively excluding them from access to the lucrative channels of campaign finance. Democrats would become both poorer and politically diminished at a stroke and the Republicans would become richer and politically hegemonic.It has worked. The most influential Washington lobbyist is Barbour, Griffiths and Rogers; it employs not a single Democrat. Last year, in a classic operation, House Republicans let the Motion Picture Association of America (the film industry lobby group) know that appointing a Democrat, Dan Glickman, as its head would mean $1.5 billion of tax relief for the film industry was now in peril. Glickman staffed up the MPAA with Republicans, but the threat remains. In 2003, the Republican National Committee could claim that 33 of the top 36 top-level K Street positions were in Republican hands. Today, it's even closer to a clean sweep.Corporations get their rewards. The oil and gas industry now gives 80 per cent of its campaign cash to Republicans (20 years ago, the split was roughly 50-50), and influence on this year's energy bill was a classic sting. American petrol can now contain a suspected carcinogen; operators of US natural-gas wells can contaminate water aquifers to improve the yields from the wells; the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is open to oil exploration - concessions all created by DeLay's inside track. And to provide ideological juice, there's a bevy of think-tanks, paid for from the same web of contributions, cranking out the justification that the 'state' and 'regulation' are everywhere and always wrong.But central to the operation is DeLay's mastery of the party in the House. To get two more Republican votes in his pocket, he organised a gerrymander in Texas to create two more seats in the 2004 election and gave the Republican campaign there some extra campaign money. The trouble was, alleges the DA, the cash from Washington originally came from Texan companies, which are forbidden directly to back individual candidates and that DeLay devised the illegal scheme.DeLay vigorously insists he's the victim of a partisan stitch-up, surely a case of the biter bit? Yet the scope for misdirection of political funds is huge. Michael Scanlon, DeLay's director of communications for six years, is under criminal investigation together with partner Jack Abramoff for the way they used $66 million, paid by 11 casino-owning native American tribes over three years into their K Street operation, and which seems to have financed, among other extraordinary expenditures, a DeLay golf trip to Scotland. Nobody checks too much on how their money is deployed as long as it brings results - access, tax breaks and legislative concessions. DeLay, Scanlon and Abramoff belong to the same culture.In Congress, moderate Republicans don't want guilt by association and companies value their reputation. The K Street Project stinks, along with all those associated with it. So far, the US media have been supine. DeLay's tentacles, and those of Karl Rove, Bush's top political adviser, have cowed media owners into the same compliance; if they want favours, best advance the Republican cause like Murdoch's Fox News. American newsrooms are fearful places.But DeLay's indictment breaks back the dam. US politics moves in cycles. Once it was Republicans who were going to clean up corrupt Democrat Washington; now Democrats can champion the same cause. Nor can the media afford to be on the side of the Old Corruption; it's bad for business. The wheel is turning, an important moment both sides of the Atlantic.","B> The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday May 16 2004</B><BR><BR>  The article below  suggests that the Great Exhibition of 1851 was in Crystal Palace.

You could draw comfort from the fact that Likud's Bibi Netanyahu, who thought he was such a dead cert to win a matter of weeks ago, was rejected, albeit narrowly, in favour of the woman he so consistently patronised, Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  Or you might take solace in the notion that the near tie between Bibi and Tzipi would most easily be resolved by the pair rotating the premiership between them, each taking a two-year turn, following the precedent set by Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir after they fought each other to a dead heat in 1984. The virtue of such an arrangement could be the exclusion of the ultra-nationalist hardman Avigdor Lieberman, whose Israel Beytenu  Israel our Home  party surged to third place on Tuesday. Or you might assume that the likeliest coalition will be unambiguously of the right, given that  even though Likud itself fell short  the parties of the self-styled ""national camp"" won a convincing victory over the centre-left bloc. Bibi's motivation will be to expose Kadima to the chill of opposition for the first time in its short life, where, Bibi hopes, it will wither and die. The result will be the most rightwing government in Israel's history. Good, one longtime peace campaigner told me yesterday. ""Let the right have power and live with the consequences."" They will soon be on a collision course with Barack Obama's Washington. Under US pressure, they will unravel, the right's limitations will have been exposed and the pendulum will swing back leftwards.  Even if that is too hopeful, some on the Israeli left see a value in the country having a full-bloodedly rightist government. ""Maybe we're like the alcoholic who needs to touch bottom before we can start the climb back up,"" was how one put it. Perhaps there has to be a crisis before there can be a recovery.  If these sound like heroic attempts at self-consolation, that is because they are. The truth is, the clouds are much clearer to see. The hawkish camp thumped the centre left on Tuesday, and that's even when you generously count Kadima and Labour  co-authors of operation Cast Lead  as the centre left. But this is about more than a victory for the right. Something else happened and its face belongs to Avigdor Lieberman, the kingmaker whose 15 seats are essential if either Bibi or Livni are to govern without each other.   He does not fit straightforwardly on the Israeli right wing. For one thing, he is avowedly secular. Indeed, much of his appeal was to anti-religious voters who liked his demand for civil unions, thereby breaking the orthodox rabbinate's current monopoly on state-sanctioned marriage. Talk of liberalising the sale of pork products proved too much for at least one religious party, whose spiritual leader warned that a vote for Lieberman was a vote for Satan. The result is that Bibi may find assembling a coalition that includes both the religious parties and Lieberman impossible.  Even more striking is the kingmaker's stance on the defining issue of Israeli politics: territorial compromise. The hard right have always opposed the very idea, clinging to the notion of Greater Israel. But Lieberman  who lives in a West Bank settlement  has said he would be prepared to give up even his own home. Unlike some of his fellow settlers, he does not regard the land as sacred soil that can never be conceded.  Make no mistake, this is not because Lieberman is some kind of crypto- peacenik. The opposite is true: I saw him give a victory speech on Tuesday in which he declared his refusal to join any government that would allow Hamas to remain in power: ""Our first goal is clear, to destroy Hamas, to take it down.""  What separates Lieberman from the traditional Revisionist Zionists that formed Likud is that his goal is not holding on to the maximum amount of land but governing over the minimum number of Arabs. To put it concisely, he would prefer a smaller, ethnically pure Israel to a larger, binational one. To that end, he would give up heavily-populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank and  much more controversially  seeks to redraw the border so that Arab areas of pre-1967 Israel become part of a Palestinian state. In other words, those who are now Palestinian citizens of Israel will find themselves living in their same homes  but under the jurisdiction of another country. Whether their consent will be sought for this move is left vague.  But it's not this idea which has made Lieberman such a toxic force. For that you have to look to the slogan that drove his campaign: ""No loyalty, no citizenship."" He would insist that every Israeli swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: anyone who refuses will lose his citizenship.  Israel Beytenu denies this is racist, insisting that every Israeli will have to swear the oath, Jewish or Arab. It is true that plenty of ultra-orthodox Jews who don't accept the authority of a godless secular state may also refuse. But the target is clearly Israel's 1.45 million Arabs. If they will not swear their allegiance, explains Lieberman deputy Uzi Landau, ""They will have residency rights but no right to vote or be in the Knesset.""  It is a truly shocking idea. I asked several Israel Beytenu luminaries if they could name a single democracy anywhere that had removed citizenship from those who already had it. I asked what they would make of demanding that, say, British Jews, swear an oath of loyalty to Britain as a Christian country on pain of losing their right to vote. I got no good answers.  There was a time when such a poisonous idea would have been confined to the lunatic extremes of the racist Kach party, led by Meir Kahane (of whose youth wing Lieberman was once a member). Twenty five years ago Kahane was banned from the Knesset. Now his heir is courted by the two main parties, desperate for his support. Kadima is untroubled by the loyalty oath scheme; Bibi says he agrees with it.  Who is to blame for this? Israel Beytenu puts the blame on the Israeli Arab leadership for flaunting their ""disloyalty"", especially during January's Gaza offensive when several prominent Israeli Arabs proclaimed their solidarity with Hamas. They say no democratic society could tolerate such a fifth column, cheering on a mortal enemy.  The Israeli left bear some indirect responsibility here too, at least for the idea of reassigning Palestinian villages inside Israel to Palestine. For years, the left has couched its opposition to the occupation in demographic terms: ruling over millions of Palestinians would eventually imperil Israel's status as a Jewish state. Lieberman is simply extending that logic beyond the 1967 borders. In this sense Lieberman is the bastard child of the Israeli peace movement.  Above all, it is Israeli society that has to take a hard look at itself. For so long, it has lived inside a bubble in which it can only see its side of the story: they hit us, so we hit back; we are under siege from hostile forces, we are the victim. In this mental landscape, even a Moldovan-born immigrant stripping people born in their own land of their citizenship can come to seem acceptable. What's needed is not just a change in the electoral system that would allow ""strong government"" of the kind Lieberman yearns to implement. What's needed is for Israelis to step outside the bubble, to begin to see the causes of their current predicament, instead of dealing again and again, ever more ineffectively, with the symptoms. Tuesday's election prompts no confidence that that is about to happen."
1,"Today a magic spell will be performed. A man who 12 weeks ago was a mere political candidate will be transformed with the incantation of a few words, before a vast crowd and a television audience in the hundreds of millions if not billions, into the head of state, even the embodiment, of the most powerful nation on earth.  It is an act of political alchemy that happens every time a new president is inaugurated, but rarely has the moment been as anticipated as this one. Washington DC, usually a city of strait-laced, sober-suited types has acquired the atmosphere of a child's bedroom in the first hours of Christmas morning. There are snow flurries outside, tacky decorations everywhere - and the resolve to wake up early, so as not to miss a moment of the great day. The excitement is intense and has been building for days, increasing with each coachload of newcomers that arrives in the city. Women wear woolly hats against the cold, the word OBAMA spelled out in diamante letters. Street-hawkers sell T-shirts bearing Obama's face, alongside ever more grandiose slogans. One shows a beatific president-to-be under the quasi-biblical declaration: ""And he shall be called Barack Obama."" The street merchandise, the nightly parties, the rare sighting of Hollywood A-listers among the policy wonks and thinktankers - that happens every four years. But no one would deny the extra fervour this time. The most obvious explanation is written on the faces of African-Americans who have travelled so far to be here. ""This moment won't come again,"" said Robert Davis, 63, who had travelled from Cincinnati, Ohio. ""There may be another black American president, but this will always be the first time.""  He was part of the throng at the Lincoln Memorial yesterday, destination for many of those who have come to see Barack Obama sworn in. Perhaps it was a way to place their desire to witness history in a historical context - close to the monument to the president who ended slavery, the site where Martin Luther King declared his dream of equality. In this, the fates have once again helped endow Obama's inauguration with an epic quality. He accepted the Democratic party's presidential nomination on the 45th anniversary, to the day, of the ""I have a dream"" speech. Yesterday, the day before Obama's installation as president, was Martin Luther King day. It added to the sense that America will today reach some kind of fulfilment, even redemption. ""King's dream became a reality,"" said Davis, his voice wavering in the cold. But it is not only black America's pride in Obama that is lending extra magic to today's act of sorcery. For one thing, there is the sheer eagerness to see the back of the present incumbent, George W Bush, who marked a ""mostly private"" last day in office yesterday by granting a cluster of pardons and making a series of goodbye calls to world leaders. No president has left office with lower approval ratings. For another, it is the fact that today's inauguration ceremony will not need to deploy too much magical power to persuade Americans to see Barack Obama as their president. Proof of that is palpable in his dizzyingly high poll ratings, with 79% optimistic about the next four years, according to the New York Times, a degree of goodwill that trumps the numbers that greeted the previous five presidents. The same poll found high levels of hope among those who voted for Obama's opponent, John McCain. It's partly because he has, in the three months of transition, done much to reassure them, appointing solid, centrist figures, including more than one Republican, to key positions. Last night he was due to attend three private dinners honouring the public service of his vice-president-to-be, Joe Biden, and Republicans Colin Powell and McCain himself. But it's also because the new president does seem blessed with the poise and stature that befits a head of state. Yesterday he again looked the part, visiting wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed army medical centre, then rolling up his sleeves and helping paint the walls at a homeless shelter for teenagers in north-east Washington - with Martin Luther King's son at his side. Obama had urged his vast email database of supporters to follow his lead and engage in a day of community service. Among those heeding the call was Michelle Obama who, with her daughters, went to Washington's RFK stadium to join 15,000 volunteers in assembling ""care packages"" for US soldiers serving abroad.  But, in a visit to the Calvin Coolidge high school, Obama said that this could not be a ""one-day affair"". He added: ""If we're waiting for someone else to do something, it never gets done."" That prefigures what is set to be one of Obama's major themes today: responsibility, the notion that government cannot solve America's vast problems alone, that everyone has to pitch in. That fits nicely with Obama's insistence that he will be able to work no miracles as president; that tackling the deepening economic crisis will be the stuff of long, hard work. The polls suggest Americans understand that. They know there will be no overnight fix. And they applaud their incoming president for saying so. Indeed, his caution and realism only make them admire him more.  Such are the paradoxes of a man who insists he is no magician - but who will stand today at the centre of something magical.","What's at stake in the Israeli election? Everything and nothing.  Start with the nothing. The battle to be prime minister comes down to two candidates, former PM Binyamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu of Likud and current foreign minister Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  As the race between the two has tightened, with the last polls showing only a two-seat gap between them, the pair have scrambled to define themselves more sharply. ""Livni at last let the word peace come out of her mouth,"" says Aluf Benn of the liberal daily Haaretz, while ""Bibi planted a tree in the Golan [Heights] and went for a walkabout in East Jerusalem.""  In those moves, Livni and Netanyahu were both acting out age-old roles, the peace candidate doing battle with the hawk. But no one seriously believes that Livni is about to deliver an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty, just as no one kids themselves that Bibi is going to realise the now-fading Likud dream of Greater Israel. Instead, in the words of one senior Israeli official, ""Whoever wins, it will be more of the same: convergence on the pragmatic centre."" If Livni were somehow to pull off a double upset, emerging with both the most seats and a presidential invitation to form a government  and the latter does not automatically follow the former  she would continue in the same vein as the outgoing Olmert administration she served: more talks with the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, more of the Annapolis process started in November 2007 and more isolation of Hamas.  Netanyahu's rhetoric has been different, ruling out any compromise on Jerusalem and still refusing to accept a Palestinian state. But were he to return to the prime minister's office, few believe he would maintain that hard line. First, he will look leftward for coalition partners, preferring to be the hawk in a centrist government than the centrist in an ultra-hawkish one. He knows that his relationship with the US  which matters more to Israeli leaders than almost anything else  will be doomed if he becomes the prisoner of rightist parties, constantly demanding settlement expansion and the like.  The result will be that Netanyahu, too, will stay on the Annapolis track, continuing to negotiate with the PA. The tone will be different from Livni's  though some say Netanyahu might even end up yielding more than she would. First, because he will be anxious, in Benn's words, ""to prove to world opinion that he is not a monster"" and, second, because his vision of ""economic peace"" calls for nurturing prosperity on the West Bank, and that must entail reducing the number of checkpoints that currently restrict Palestinian movement so badly.  Hence the impression that there's not much difference at the top  and next to nothing at stake. And yet, others say something very profound is on the line in this election, their angst stirred by the rise and rise of the man set to claim third place and the role of kingmaker: Avigdor Lieberman. A nationalist to his friends, a racist to his enemies, the Russian-born Lieberman poses as an Israeli Putin, the strongman saviour Israel is crying out for. His signature proposal is to remove the citizenship of anyone who refuses to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: his target is clearly the 1.45m Palestinian Arabs who live as citizens inside Israel proper. Many liberals laugh off Lieberman as an opportunist, insisting that his loyalty oath plan will come to nothing. But others tremble at the toxicity he has unleashed.  Asked what's at stake in this election, one scholar at Tel Aviv University answered instantly: ""Israel's soul."

A sad, sad song. It's always tough when a hugely talented professional sees his heart's desire slip away. But it is also - no ducking, weaving or glossing - Gordon's own fault: bad politics as well as bad vibrations. Take a few findings from the latest Telegraph/YouGov poll. Do you approve of the government's record to date? No, say 68%. What about issues like Europe and taxation? The Tories are in the lead. And economic competence, the rock of reputations prudently built? Just 32% have kept faith with Brown. And 31% (since you ask) would prefer to see Michael Howard on the Treasury bridge. There's something of the night for all concerned here.  Now polls, of course, can be shrugged away. The chancel-lor's spinners say he'll shrug for Britain today when he tells the Social Market Forum that his ""prudent and cautious"" spending plans are on course, needing no new taxes; that the dear old ""fundamentals are sound""; that while our share prices are only 48% down, Germany's have tumbled a whopping 67%. But this, alas, is politics, not comparative economics. This is show-business. Listen, therefore, to the dismal tinkle of luck and applause running out.  He said there'd be no more boom and bust. That is not how it feels. He took an early pop at the pension funds. Now they're becoming a national crisis, staggering from pillar to post, demolishing ordinary dreams as they go. Just as the taxation tide turns, so last year's national insurance rises snap into place. Just as the cash for public services comes on stream, so the firemen stoke a different boiler. Just as congestion charges arrive, so the Central line goes awol. And then there is university funding.  Every problem that seemed so breezy when there was growth and confidence, in short, now comes glooming round to Gordon's door. Things could be more awful, naturally. That's always true. Yet lustre, once lost, is powerful hard to get shining again.  In a normal Westminster world, you'd know what would happen next. A threat to the chancellor would be a threat to the prime minister and continuing governance. It would thus be loyally batted away unless (like Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson) ritual sacrifices were more the order of the day. A chancellor is there to be defended until it's time, in extremis, to ditch him. But Mr Brown and Mr Blair don't live in a ""normal"" world.  They are both big beasts. Almost a decade ago, they sat over lunch in Islington and made the Granita accord. I won't stand against you for Labour leader (and thus prospective PM) if you quit half-way through your second term and let me have a go. Was it ever quite as neat as that? The old Granita restaurant was a famously noisy, clattery place. Maybe Tony dropped his bread roll at the wrong moment? Maybe Gordon found a fly in his soup? Still ... the legend and the black looks live on.  What we've had for almost six years now isn't the traditional line of command, prime minister down to chancellor, but more a division of the Whitehall realm into two rival kingdoms. The leaders have their own camps and followers. They jockey, needle and probe. They are allies in public and snarlers or sniffers behind the arras. Like North and South Korea, they always need watching. And it's Granita time, time to move over. High noon.  But is Mr Blair going to pack his bags and, like Peter Foster, depart for distant parts? Of course not. That was always an illusion. A disastrous war in Iraq might carry him off - but, in harsh practicality if not morality, it's far more likely that Saddam will crumple and a string of Iraqi scientists thereafter bear witness to the horrors averted. There's no alternative to a continuing Tony. There are, however, plenty of reasons why a continuing Gordon may not be so fireproof. Who wants a magician who's lost his wand? Who wants a baleful, brooding problem when fresh starts are easier?  It is because the realm was divided, because the pieces were scrapped over and parcelled out, that Gordon Brown is suddenly so vulnerable. Traditionally, when a prime minister has a night of the long knives with his neighbour, it is the PM's own status and policies that also appear in the frame. Sacking has its costs. But here the equation is different. Because Brown manifestly runs his own five tests, his own prescriptions for the markets, his own private funding initiatives and target-setting squads, because they are his and not Blair's, so the policies and the man can be simultaneously removed without that damage: a liberation rather than an assassination.  Would there be crisis and flak when the moment came? Inescapably. But it would also set the prime minister free, on course to be his own man with his own chancellor for a third term. It would allow New Labour a new beginning. And to see the logic, you need only consider the alternative: no change, no joy, animosity as usual. Who can possibly settle for another six years of this? Who would want to?  There's the fault with Mr Brown. He shouldn't have believed his own publicity. He should have shifted himself, in triumph, to foreign secretary or deputy PM a year ago. He should have remained forever Mr Boom not Mr Bust. He should have known that, like Jim Callaghan, his time would come if he was loyal and efficient and on the team, not a king over the water. He should, simply, have been smarter."

Asked what's at stake in this election, one scholar at Tel Aviv University answered instantly: ""Israel's soul.","The search for silver linings in the murky cloud of yesterday's Israeli election requires a great effort of the will. There is not much to go on. You could draw comfort from the fact that Likud's Bibi Netanyahu, who thought he was such a dead cert to win a matter of weeks ago, was rejected, albeit narrowly, in favour of the woman he so consistently patronised, Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  Or you might take solace in the notion that the near tie between Bibi and Tzipi would most easily be resolved by the pair rotating the premiership between them, each taking a two-year turn, following the precedent set by Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir after they fought each other to a dead heat in 1984. The virtue of such an arrangement could be the exclusion of the ultra-nationalist hardman Avigdor Lieberman, whose Israel Beytenu  Israel our Home  party surged to third place on Tuesday. Or you might assume that the likeliest coalition will be unambiguously of the right, given that  even though Likud itself fell short  the parties of the self-styled ""national camp"" won a convincing victory over the centre-left bloc. Bibi's motivation will be to expose Kadima to the chill of opposition for the first time in its short life, where, Bibi hopes, it will wither and die. The result will be the most rightwing government in Israel's history. Good, one longtime peace campaigner told me yesterday. ""Let the right have power and live with the consequences."" They will soon be on a collision course with Barack Obama's Washington. Under US pressure, they will unravel, the right's limitations will have been exposed and the pendulum will swing back leftwards.  Even if that is too hopeful, some on the Israeli left see a value in the country having a full-bloodedly rightist government. ""Maybe we're like the alcoholic who needs to touch bottom before we can start the climb back up,"" was how one put it. Perhaps there has to be a crisis before there can be a recovery.  If these sound like heroic attempts at self-consolation, that is because they are. The truth is, the clouds are much clearer to see. The hawkish camp thumped the centre left on Tuesday, and that's even when you generously count Kadima and Labour  co-authors of operation Cast Lead  as the centre left. But this is about more than a victory for the right. Something else happened and its face belongs to Avigdor Lieberman, the kingmaker whose 15 seats are essential if either Bibi or Livni are to govern without each other.   He does not fit straightforwardly on the Israeli right wing. For one thing, he is avowedly secular. Indeed, much of his appeal was to anti-religious voters who liked his demand for civil unions, thereby breaking the orthodox rabbinate's current monopoly on state-sanctioned marriage. Talk of liberalising the sale of pork products proved too much for at least one religious party, whose spiritual leader warned that a vote for Lieberman was a vote for Satan. The result is that Bibi may find assembling a coalition that includes both the religious parties and Lieberman impossible.  Even more striking is the kingmaker's stance on the defining issue of Israeli politics: territorial compromise. The hard right have always opposed the very idea, clinging to the notion of Greater Israel. But Lieberman  who lives in a West Bank settlement  has said he would be prepared to give up even his own home. Unlike some of his fellow settlers, he does not regard the land as sacred soil that can never be conceded.  Make no mistake, this is not because Lieberman is some kind of crypto- peacenik. The opposite is true: I saw him give a victory speech on Tuesday in which he declared his refusal to join any government that would allow Hamas to remain in power: ""Our first goal is clear, to destroy Hamas, to take it down.""  What separates Lieberman from the traditional Revisionist Zionists that formed Likud is that his goal is not holding on to the maximum amount of land but governing over the minimum number of Arabs. To put it concisely, he would prefer a smaller, ethnically pure Israel to a larger, binational one. To that end, he would give up heavily-populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank and  much more controversially  seeks to redraw the border so that Arab areas of pre-1967 Israel become part of a Palestinian state. In other words, those who are now Palestinian citizens of Israel will find themselves living in their same homes  but under the jurisdiction of another country. Whether their consent will be sought for this move is left vague.  But it's not this idea which has made Lieberman such a toxic force. For that you have to look to the slogan that drove his campaign: ""No loyalty, no citizenship."" He would insist that every Israeli swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: anyone who refuses will lose his citizenship.  Israel Beytenu denies this is racist, insisting that every Israeli will have to swear the oath, Jewish or Arab. It is true that plenty of ultra-orthodox Jews who don't accept the authority of a godless secular state may also refuse. But the target is clearly Israel's 1.45 million Arabs. If they will not swear their allegiance, explains Lieberman deputy Uzi Landau, ""They will have residency rights but no right to vote or be in the Knesset.""  It is a truly shocking idea. I asked several Israel Beytenu luminaries if they could name a single democracy anywhere that had removed citizenship from those who already had it. I asked what they would make of demanding that, say, British Jews, swear an oath of loyalty to Britain as a Christian country on pain of losing their right to vote. I got no good answers.  There was a time when such a poisonous idea would have been confined to the lunatic extremes of the racist Kach party, led by Meir Kahane (of whose youth wing Lieberman was once a member). Twenty five years ago Kahane was banned from the Knesset. Now his heir is courted by the two main parties, desperate for his support. Kadima is untroubled by the loyalty oath scheme; Bibi says he agrees with it.  Who is to blame for this? Israel Beytenu puts the blame on the Israeli Arab leadership for flaunting their ""disloyalty"", especially during January's Gaza offensive when several prominent Israeli Arabs proclaimed their solidarity with Hamas. They say no democratic society could tolerate such a fifth column, cheering on a mortal enemy.  The Israeli left bear some indirect responsibility here too, at least for the idea of reassigning Palestinian villages inside Israel to Palestine. For years, the left has couched its opposition to the occupation in demographic terms: ruling over millions of Palestinians would eventually imperil Israel's status as a Jewish state. Lieberman is simply extending that logic beyond the 1967 borders. In this sense Lieberman is the bastard child of the Israeli peace movement.  Above all, it is Israeli society that has to take a hard look at itself. For so long, it has lived inside a bubble in which it can only see its side of the story: they hit us, so we hit back; we are under siege from hostile forces, we are the victim. In this mental landscape, even a Moldovan-born immigrant stripping people born in their own land of their citizenship can come to seem acceptable. What's needed is not just a change in the electoral system that would allow ""strong government"" of the kind Lieberman yearns to implement. What's needed is for Israelis to step outside the bubble, to begin to see the causes of their current predicament, instead of dealing again and again, ever more ineffectively, with the symptoms. Tuesday's election prompts no confidence that that is about to happen."
0,"What's at stake in the Israeli election? Everything and nothing.  Start with the nothing. The battle to be prime minister comes down to two candidates, former PM Binyamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu of Likud and current foreign minister Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  As the race between the two has tightened, with the last polls showing only a two-seat gap between them, the pair have scrambled to define themselves more sharply. ""Livni at last let the word peace come out of her mouth,"" says Aluf Benn of the liberal daily Haaretz, while ""Bibi planted a tree in the Golan [Heights] and went for a walkabout in East Jerusalem.""  In those moves, Livni and Netanyahu were both acting out age-old roles, the peace candidate doing battle with the hawk. But no one seriously believes that Livni is about to deliver an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty, just as no one kids themselves that Bibi is going to realise the now-fading Likud dream of Greater Israel. Instead, in the words of one senior Israeli official, ""Whoever wins, it will be more of the same: convergence on the pragmatic centre."" If Livni were somehow to pull off a double upset, emerging with both the most seats and a presidential invitation to form a government  and the latter does not automatically follow the former  she would continue in the same vein as the outgoing Olmert administration she served: more talks with the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, more of the Annapolis process started in November 2007 and more isolation of Hamas.  Netanyahu's rhetoric has been different, ruling out any compromise on Jerusalem and still refusing to accept a Palestinian state. But were he to return to the prime minister's office, few believe he would maintain that hard line. First, he will look leftward for coalition partners, preferring to be the hawk in a centrist government than the centrist in an ultra-hawkish one. He knows that his relationship with the US  which matters more to Israeli leaders than almost anything else  will be doomed if he becomes the prisoner of rightist parties, constantly demanding settlement expansion and the like.  The result will be that Netanyahu, too, will stay on the Annapolis track, continuing to negotiate with the PA. The tone will be different from Livni's  though some say Netanyahu might even end up yielding more than she would. First, because he will be anxious, in Benn's words, ""to prove to world opinion that he is not a monster"" and, second, because his vision of ""economic peace"" calls for nurturing prosperity on the West Bank, and that must entail reducing the number of checkpoints that currently restrict Palestinian movement so badly.  Hence the impression that there's not much difference at the top  and next to nothing at stake. And yet, others say something very profound is on the line in this election, their angst stirred by the rise and rise of the man set to claim third place and the role of kingmaker: Avigdor Lieberman. A nationalist to his friends, a racist to his enemies, the Russian-born Lieberman poses as an Israeli Putin, the strongman saviour Israel is crying out for. His signature proposal is to remove the citizenship of anyone who refuses to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: his target is clearly the 1.45m Palestinian Arabs who live as citizens inside Israel proper. Many liberals laugh off Lieberman as an opportunist, insisting that his loyalty oath plan will come to nothing. But others tremble at the toxicity he has unleashed.  Asked what's at stake in this election, one scholar at Tel Aviv University answered instantly: ""Israel's soul.","The ID-cards vote passed: however angry Labour MPs are at this succession of pointless provocations inflicted on them, there is sensible a limit to how much damage they will inflict on themselves. Plenty of them have much to fear in their own constituencies in this low season for Labour.Those who did spend a freezing wet weekend in Blackpool found the spring conference pretty dismal and dispiriting. It was planned as a rip-roaring celebration of Labour's glorious centenary, but few people came; there were few MPs, a smattering of ministers drafted in, and the press room was bare. Many constituency parties sent no delegates.The frail state of the grassroots was whispered often in the Winter Gardens. Hazel Blears and John Prescott, trying to bounce the party into a semblance of life with defibrillator jolts of demented optimism, rashly opined that parties which wither at the roots will die at the top. With most big cities lost and a massacre of remaining councils expected at the May elections, some constituency parties that have recently lost their MP, their council and most councillors are struggling to sustain the will to live. Now add in the Dunfermline result and it's not surprising that so few went to Blackpool. As the leadership interregnum drags on, it saps the blood of the party.Tony Blair turned in a below-par speech. But even belowpar and fading in power to convince, every time he steps up to a lectern he reminds them all of his political genius. It is the same in the Commons: he stands amid swelling backbench rebellion, yet on Wednesday mornings he can rouse his party to whooping glee as he lands punches on the bench opposite, reminding his own that they may miss him when he's gone. With all that vim and verve, no wonder he can't let go. So much still to do, so much to stop his successor doing.It is human instinct to clutch after immortality, leaving a footstep in the shifting sand. But political leaders crave it with unnatural passion. Blair is trying to force his legacy on to his successor, fixing Gordon Brown's feet in concrete into his own footsteps. The so-called ""dual prime minister"" scenario described by Charles Clarke looks more like the grizzly embrace of death, the dying man holding the future leader in a deadly grip with his last gasp.In this terminal phase, Brown has no option but to obey. So out he goes to bat for the ID cards he used to think wildly too expensive. In his speech yesterday on security, he even made a reasonable stab at pretending a pressing need for the ""glorification of terrorism"" clause, which virtually no one in the Commons believes. His speeches are taking a Churchillian turn as he reprises his Britishness theme, calling for ceremonies in every constituency for Veterans' Day and new cadet schemes to instil military discipline in state-school pupils. ""We will not yield, relax, rest, become complacent or lower our guard but will use every means, every necessary resource..."" and more, to fight terror.The daily taunts from the Tories (and some Blairites) that Brown will abandon ""reform"" to lead Labour back to its dark days of producer interests and union power seem to be hitting their mark. In response, no flag is big enough, no trumpet loud enough, no dead hero's memorial tall enough - Brown must add to their patriotic clamour.It may not gladden the hearts of those hoping that his premiership will herald renewal, optimism and progressive enthusiasm. Every time Brown parrots the need for ""reform, reform, reform"" as defined by Blair, spirits in the party sink a bit lower. But he has no choice. He is destined to follow Blair's footsteps every inch of the way - until the old leader finally departs and discovers that no prime minister can ever command the future beyond his time.All this tells us very little of what to expect when Brown's day finally comes. Expect no more than a tiny flash of the cardinal's red lining in what he says now. Whether once in power he will ever give more than the odd tantalising glimpse, it's hard to know. But for now he has no choice but tough talking. The success of New Labour was built on the ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"" slogan that Brown himself devised. Unless Labour can prove itself as patriotic, as ready to fight and as ready to punish wrongdoers as the Tories, it will lose, lose and lose again. True, Blair has taken this game into extreme overkill, fighting more wars and locking up more criminals than any other government. But no Labour leader can survive if they fail the ""toughness"" test.With Brown, more lies beneath the rhetoric. Everyone is for ""reform"": he hints that his might be of a different hue. Tucked into yesterday's tough speech on security was a balancing thoughtfulness on stronger democratic accountability and shoring up civil liberties, and a seriousness about rights, with radical constitutional proposals to come. There are layers of ideas wrapped inside his flag as he strives to reclaim patriotism and Britishness for the progressive cause. It sounds so counterintuitive and unconvincing to many Labour ears that it may be a hopeless task - but it does make him unassailable by the Tories. He promises more optimistic themes in speeches to follow - easing the hardship of the lives of those ""hardworking"" families so often extolled by politicians, with more to come on social justice, children and opportunity.But he can say little while cemented into the Blair footprints. Hints and briefings are not much to go on, leaving his party clutching at straws: some will point despairingly at Brown's ultra-caution, secretiveness and failure to castigate boardroom greed. The economic dysfunction caused by gross income inequality never draws a murmur of disapproval. Some doubters worry it will be more of the same, but without Blair's magic appeal to the middle classes.Just wait until he gets his freedom, say his supporters. There will be a cornucopia of surprises, an opening up of government in a style to confound his critics. Purpose, drive and dynamism will bring the renewal this party needs.Whichever it is to be, even those wary of Brown now join his enthusiasts in just wanting to get the waiting over. At Blackpool I stopped 15 local delegates in a row, including some Labour party stewards. That's hardly a significant sample, but every single one said unequivocally that Blair should go by the summer and let the party start again at the autumn conference. Until he goes this will remain a fractious party in a state of suspended animation."
1,"The search for silver linings in the murky cloud of yesterday's Israeli election requires a great effort of the will. There is not much to go on. You could draw comfort from the fact that Likud's Bibi Netanyahu, who thought he was such a dead cert to win a matter of weeks ago, was rejected, albeit narrowly, in favour of the woman he so consistently patronised, Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  Or you might take solace in the notion that the near tie between Bibi and Tzipi would most easily be resolved by the pair rotating the premiership between them, each taking a two-year turn, following the precedent set by Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir after they fought each other to a dead heat in 1984. The virtue of such an arrangement could be the exclusion of the ultra-nationalist hardman Avigdor Lieberman, whose Israel Beytenu  Israel our Home  party surged to third place on Tuesday. Or you might assume that the likeliest coalition will be unambiguously of the right, given that  even though Likud itself fell short  the parties of the self-styled ""national camp"" won a convincing victory over the centre-left bloc. Bibi's motivation will be to expose Kadima to the chill of opposition for the first time in its short life, where, Bibi hopes, it will wither and die. The result will be the most rightwing government in Israel's history. Good, one longtime peace campaigner told me yesterday. ""Let the right have power and live with the consequences."" They will soon be on a collision course with Barack Obama's Washington. Under US pressure, they will unravel, the right's limitations will have been exposed and the pendulum will swing back leftwards.  Even if that is too hopeful, some on the Israeli left see a value in the country having a full-bloodedly rightist government. ""Maybe we're like the alcoholic who needs to touch bottom before we can start the climb back up,"" was how one put it. Perhaps there has to be a crisis before there can be a recovery.  If these sound like heroic attempts at self-consolation, that is because they are. The truth is, the clouds are much clearer to see. The hawkish camp thumped the centre left on Tuesday, and that's even when you generously count Kadima and Labour  co-authors of operation Cast Lead  as the centre left. But this is about more than a victory for the right. Something else happened and its face belongs to Avigdor Lieberman, the kingmaker whose 15 seats are essential if either Bibi or Livni are to govern without each other.   He does not fit straightforwardly on the Israeli right wing. For one thing, he is avowedly secular. Indeed, much of his appeal was to anti-religious voters who liked his demand for civil unions, thereby breaking the orthodox rabbinate's current monopoly on state-sanctioned marriage. Talk of liberalising the sale of pork products proved too much for at least one religious party, whose spiritual leader warned that a vote for Lieberman was a vote for Satan. The result is that Bibi may find assembling a coalition that includes both the religious parties and Lieberman impossible.  Even more striking is the kingmaker's stance on the defining issue of Israeli politics: territorial compromise. The hard right have always opposed the very idea, clinging to the notion of Greater Israel. But Lieberman  who lives in a West Bank settlement  has said he would be prepared to give up even his own home. Unlike some of his fellow settlers, he does not regard the land as sacred soil that can never be conceded.  Make no mistake, this is not because Lieberman is some kind of crypto- peacenik. The opposite is true: I saw him give a victory speech on Tuesday in which he declared his refusal to join any government that would allow Hamas to remain in power: ""Our first goal is clear, to destroy Hamas, to take it down.""  What separates Lieberman from the traditional Revisionist Zionists that formed Likud is that his goal is not holding on to the maximum amount of land but governing over the minimum number of Arabs. To put it concisely, he would prefer a smaller, ethnically pure Israel to a larger, binational one. To that end, he would give up heavily-populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank and  much more controversially  seeks to redraw the border so that Arab areas of pre-1967 Israel become part of a Palestinian state. In other words, those who are now Palestinian citizens of Israel will find themselves living in their same homes  but under the jurisdiction of another country. Whether their consent will be sought for this move is left vague.  But it's not this idea which has made Lieberman such a toxic force. For that you have to look to the slogan that drove his campaign: ""No loyalty, no citizenship."" He would insist that every Israeli swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: anyone who refuses will lose his citizenship.  Israel Beytenu denies this is racist, insisting that every Israeli will have to swear the oath, Jewish or Arab.

Tuesday's election prompts no confidence that that is about to happen.","Today a magic spell will be performed. A man who 12 weeks ago was a mere political candidate will be transformed with the incantation of a few words, before a vast crowd and a television audience in the hundreds of millions if not billions, into the head of state, even the embodiment, of the most powerful nation on earth.  It is an act of political alchemy that happens every time a new president is inaugurated, but rarely has the moment been as anticipated as this one. Washington DC, usually a city of strait-laced, sober-suited types has acquired the atmosphere of a child's bedroom in the first hours of Christmas morning. There are snow flurries outside, tacky decorations everywhere - and the resolve to wake up early, so as not to miss a moment of the great day. The excitement is intense and has been building for days, increasing with each coachload of newcomers that arrives in the city. Women wear woolly hats against the cold, the word OBAMA spelled out in diamante letters. Street-hawkers sell T-shirts bearing Obama's face, alongside ever more grandiose slogans. One shows a beatific president-to-be under the quasi-biblical declaration: ""And he shall be called Barack Obama."" The street merchandise, the nightly parties, the rare sighting of Hollywood A-listers among the policy wonks and thinktankers - that happens every four years. But no one would deny the extra fervour this time. The most obvious explanation is written on the faces of African-Americans who have travelled so far to be here. ""This moment won't come again,"" said Robert Davis, 63, who had travelled from Cincinnati, Ohio. ""There may be another black American president, but this will always be the first time.""  He was part of the throng at the Lincoln Memorial yesterday, destination for many of those who have come to see Barack Obama sworn in. Perhaps it was a way to place their desire to witness history in a historical context - close to the monument to the president who ended slavery, the site where Martin Luther King declared his dream of equality. In this, the fates have once again helped endow Obama's inauguration with an epic quality. He accepted the Democratic party's presidential nomination on the 45th anniversary, to the day, of the ""I have a dream"" speech. Yesterday, the day before Obama's installation as president, was Martin Luther King day. It added to the sense that America will today reach some kind of fulfilment, even redemption. ""King's dream became a reality,"" said Davis, his voice wavering in the cold. But it is not only black America's pride in Obama that is lending extra magic to today's act of sorcery. For one thing, there is the sheer eagerness to see the back of the present incumbent, George W Bush, who marked a ""mostly private"" last day in office yesterday by granting a cluster of pardons and making a series of goodbye calls to world leaders. No president has left office with lower approval ratings. For another, it is the fact that today's inauguration ceremony will not need to deploy too much magical power to persuade Americans to see Barack Obama as their president. Proof of that is palpable in his dizzyingly high poll ratings, with 79% optimistic about the next four years, according to the New York Times, a degree of goodwill that trumps the numbers that greeted the previous five presidents. The same poll found high levels of hope among those who voted for Obama's opponent, John McCain. It's partly because he has, in the three months of transition, done much to reassure them, appointing solid, centrist figures, including more than one Republican, to key positions. Last night he was due to attend three private dinners honouring the public service of his vice-president-to-be, Joe Biden, and Republicans Colin Powell and McCain himself. But it's also because the new president does seem blessed with the poise and stature that befits a head of state. Yesterday he again looked the part, visiting wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed army medical centre, then rolling up his sleeves and helping paint the walls at a homeless shelter for teenagers in north-east Washington - with Martin Luther King's son at his side. Obama had urged his vast email database of supporters to follow his lead and engage in a day of community service. Among those heeding the call was Michelle Obama who, with her daughters, went to Washington's RFK stadium to join 15,000 volunteers in assembling ""care packages"" for US soldiers serving abroad.  But, in a visit to the Calvin Coolidge high school, Obama said that this could not be a ""one-day affair"". He added: ""If we're waiting for someone else to do something, it never gets done."" That prefigures what is set to be one of Obama's major themes today: responsibility, the notion that government cannot solve America's vast problems alone, that everyone has to pitch in. That fits nicely with Obama's insistence that he will be able to work no miracles as president; that tackling the deepening economic crisis will be the stuff of long, hard work. The polls suggest Americans understand that. They know there will be no overnight fix. And they applaud their incoming president for saying so. Indeed, his caution and realism only make them admire him more.  Such are the paradoxes of a man who insists he is no magician - but who will stand today at the centre of something magical."

In the past two weeks the world has been changing astonishingly quickly beneath our feet and commentators are running to keep up. It may turn out to be a temporary phenomenon, just erratic after-shocks before global business returns to normal. But a hurricane wind of change is in the air.<BR><BR> The prospect opens up that a whole logjam of territorial and ideological conflicts have been jolted into unblocking some rivers of progress - if this ends well, if the US stays fully engaged. All of us who stand watching and waiting for war, hearts in mouths, fearing cataclysm but hoping for success, need to be alert and ready to change. This is a time to park ideological shoes outside and be prepared to reassess all kinds of old id&eacute;es fixes, of right and left. (The shoes will still be there if the world disappointingly backslides behind old battlelines.) Start with the Bush phenomenon. This political pygmy fought a poisonous election campaign, a caricature of everything the outside world despises about greedy America. Once in power he was tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to impose NMD as a symbol of a US isolated under its exclusive umbrella - and to hell with the rest of the world. <BR><BR>World trade negotiations were one-sided, not a penny of US debt relief was paid as he pushed through $1.3 trillion tax cuts despite the need for health and schools. Drilling in Alaskan wildlife refuges, the oil man denying global warming and denouncing Kyoto: belching America didn't give a damn, that was the Bush global message. He didn't need to know the names of faraway countries because they didn't count.  But now suddenly they do. One after another the nations of the world joining a grand coalition have shown him how interconnected things are. Foreign peoples are now needed and their needs are interwoven with US interests in security, prosperity, trade and terrorism: no country, even the US, is an island after all. Globalisation works both ways.  Did we misunderestimate the man, to use his own misword? Probably not, but it hardly matters what is or isn't in his head, who pulls his strings, does the diplomacy or writes the speeches. What matters now is what he says and does. On the old Nixon-in-China principle, this man might direct the world towards peace better than some liberal president always fearful of redneck US opinion. So an open mind is required by all after his speech last week and the background briefings since. Astonishing things have been said and done. Short of the fall of the iron curtain, few world leaders have ever about-faced so fast.  One great jolt came when Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defence, mused last week that it would now be necessary for the US to construct an acceptable post-Kyoto strategy: that presumably is a message carried back from Europe, where Green parties share government. All over the world the quid pro quos are coming home to roost: America has had to change. Nothing is set in stone any more, everything is fluid. <BR><BR>Before September 11 there was a European way, largely social democratic, and an American way, largely conservative. British anti-Europeans clung to the US, the left looked to Europe and Tony Blair's bridge across the Atlantic looked like an irritating third way fudge. But those of us who saw the world that way have had to shift: in extremis, the cultural and political dividers between Europe and the US are second-order issues when compared to the Taliban and Bin Laden.  No doubt the day will come again when those issues loom large - but not now. As for the Eurosceptics, they have to swallow their old distaste in admiration for the coherence of Europe of which we are an integral part. In another remarkable global jolt there is Vladimir Putin offering airspace, airports and military aid in a joint Russian/US/EU anti-Taliban enterprise.  One more after-shock is the changed attitude to Israel. Bush said in his early days he would not bother with the peace process, but no more: Israel's best friends now look set to enforce it. Luckily it is a far-right Israeli government that will have to face the global reality of its situation, even if it did greet Jack Straw's mere mention of a Palestinian state as ""obscene"" and ""pornographic"". <BR><BR>But the message of Iran's return to the international fold and all those other Arab states offering positive support has to mean an imposed peace between Israel and Palestine sooner rather than later. It is the absolute sine qua non for calming Islamic fury against the west. Only an Israel residing strictly within its borders can secure long-term security from this new world coalition. <BR><BR>Until now the bloodied Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism could look the soft Americans in the eye and shame them. Now the Americans are bloodied too. As they send their men in to die fighting terrorism they have the moral right to tell the Israelis and the Palestinians that peace is the only game in town, for everyone's safety. Meanwhile Arab autocracies fester dangerously while propped up by the west, but they will not be democratised until the Israel/Palestine tragedy is cauterised.  Will the Afghan war be worth it? The government grumbles about the usual Phil Space articles with whizz-bang boys' comic maps of imaginary fighters zapping phantom Bin Laden hideouts, while the real war plans are secret to virtually all. Laptop brigadiers can only demand that it is quick, proportionate and does not knock down dominos of violence elsewhere. We cannot assess the odds of removing the Taliban, denying terrorists the water they swim in and keeping this coalition together afterwards to ease other long-standing grievances. But official language suggests the US knows that carpet-bombing atrocities would end the fragile coalition.  Pacifists are up in arms, an ever-necessary warning to war leaders not to make matters worse - but alternative plans to bomb the Taliban with food lack a certain conviction. Recent military interventions by the democratic world to impose freedoms have mainly had good outcomes, creating something better for proportionate casualties. Though each war provoked peace protests at the time, most Sierra Leoneans, Kuwaitis, Serbians and Kosovans are better off. So are the peoples of Croatia, East Timor and Argentina. Bosnia and Rwanda were lessons in favour of fighting, where mere peacekeeping permitted shameful massacres.  This time the Taliban are indisputably the vilest regime on earth, as well as lethally dangerous: the only unknown is the outcome. For now, old fixed attitudes towards the US and many other nations need to be suspended, waiting to see if many parts of the world really are undergoing fundamental recalibrations of old positions."
1,"Even nature went out of its way to make it the perfect night for Barack Obama. On a warm, summery evening in usually frigid Chicago, people gathered in their hundreds of thousands for what they knew was the greatest victory party of their lives. They stood together in Grant Park, roaring as they watched the giant jumbo screens, belting out CNN, announce that key state after key state had fallen to Obama. They whooped when New Hampshire and Pennsylvania were declared for the Democrat - states that John McCain had to win - barely containing their joy. Couples embraced; one man began pogoing on the spot. But when they heard, shortly after 8.30pm local time, that Ohio had fallen into the Obama column, they at last put aside their superstition and their angst, and allowed themselves to believe that the prize was theirs. They knew that no Republican had won the presidency without Ohio in nearly 50 years. It was Ohio that had broken Democratic hearts four years ago. Yet Obama had won it - and won it big. This is what the crowds in Grant Park had come for: to see history made before their eyes, to witness an epochal moment in the great American story. ""I am 63 years old, I marched with Dr King in Selma, Alabama and I never thought this day would come,"" said Linda Slaughter, her face shining with joy. Now, at long last, four decades after the bloody battles for civil rights, she believed that any American could fulfil their potential, regardless of their race. ""The day has come when anybody in America can be who they want to be."" Just imagining a black man as president was thrilling. ""I think he'll be the smartest, greatest president we've ever had,"" she said, all but brimming over. The delight was shared by fathers and sons wearing unofficial souvenir T-shirts declaring ""President Obama, commander in chief"". The Obama camp had been wary of making a premature declaration. Even as the chances of a McCain victory grew more distant, his path through the electoral college more unlikely, they were counselling caution. Earlier, they had reacted to a set of exit polls that predicted an earth-moving landslide with a declaration that they simply didn't believe them. Too many of them remembered the afternoon exit polls of 2004 - which anointed John Kerry as president. But like an Elizabethan play, in which the elements foretell the affairs of kings, the weather in Chicago seemed just one of several signs that a new, sunnier era was on the way. In the lead-up to election day, Obama had been addressing crowds numbering in the tens of thousands. His final campaign rally had brought 100,000 people to Manassas, Virginia, close to midnight. McCain, meanwhile, had struggled to draw more than a couple of thousand supporters. In the Britain of April 1997, it was clear - palpable in the air - that the country was hungry for change. It was hard not to sense that same mood in America this autumn. You could feel it at the polling station for the 42nd ward of downtown Chicago. There, inside a building that houses both a student hall of residence and a retirement home, a steady line of old and young had streamed in to pick up their ballot papers and fill in the solid black line that marked a vote for Obama for president. ""It feels like a new era kind of dawning,"" said Peter Morris, a 23-year-old theology student. He had recently visited relatives in Oklahoma and their racism had shocked him: ""There was an attitude, even among some Democrats, that they wouldn't vote for him because he's black."" Morris had voted with enthusiasm, he said, partly to show those relatives they were wrong. He had been able to zip in and zip out. But for 66-year old Louise Buchanan, it was a longer journey. Using a walking frame, she inched towards a polling booth, stopping to catch her breath. Once there, she took her time, reading each line on the lengthy ballot. Eventually the job was done. She handed her paper to one of the young volunteers who fed it into the electronic scanner - and a smile spread across her face. ""I didn't think I would live to see this,"" she said afterwards. ""So many from our past didn't live to see this."" She had grown up in the deep southern state of Mississippi. ""I didn't get to go to school when I was coming up."" She had worked instead, picking cotton. And now she was voting for the man she hoped would become America's first African-American president. ""I feel like it's gonna be better for people of colour."" Hours earlier, a little after 7.30am, the Obamas had cast their votes, their daughters in tow, at their polling station in the ultra-liberal, arugula-and-latte neighbourhood of Hyde Park. They narrowly avoided what could have been an awkward, and even politically costly, collision. An earlier visitor to the same polling station was the Obamas' neighbour, William Ayers, the former leader of the Weather Underground involved in a string of bombings in the 1960s. Obama's connection with Ayers had formed a large plank of the Republican case against him - and the two men missed each other at the Beulah Shoesmith elementary school by just a few minutes. While Obama filled in his ballot form, his seven-year-old daughter, Sasha, could be seen clutching his leg, a picture of childish impatience. His wife Michelle had her head down, concentrating hard on that lengthy ballot paper. Afterwards Obama joked with reporters: ""I noticed that Michelle took a long time,"" he said. ""I had to check to see who she was voting for."" Obama was asked if he was feeling sentimental. He was on the brink of winning the presidency, barely more than 24 hours after the death of the woman who had raised him, his grandmother Madelyn Dunham. ""You know I'm sure I will tonight,"" he said. For now, though, ""I feel really good.","Today a magic spell will be performed. A man who 12 weeks ago was a mere political candidate will be transformed with the incantation of a few words, before a vast crowd and a television audience in the hundreds of millions if not billions, into the head of state, even the embodiment, of the most powerful nation on earth.  It is an act of political alchemy that happens every time a new president is inaugurated, but rarely has the moment been as anticipated as this one. Washington DC, usually a city of strait-laced, sober-suited types has acquired the atmosphere of a child's bedroom in the first hours of Christmas morning. There are snow flurries outside, tacky decorations everywhere - and the resolve to wake up early, so as not to miss a moment of the great day. The excitement is intense and has been building for days, increasing with each coachload of newcomers that arrives in the city. Women wear woolly hats against the cold, the word OBAMA spelled out in diamante letters. Street-hawkers sell T-shirts bearing Obama's face, alongside ever more grandiose slogans. One shows a beatific president-to-be under the quasi-biblical declaration: ""And he shall be called Barack Obama."" The street merchandise, the nightly parties, the rare sighting of Hollywood A-listers among the policy wonks and thinktankers - that happens every four years. But no one would deny the extra fervour this time. The most obvious explanation is written on the faces of African-Americans who have travelled so far to be here. ""This moment won't come again,"" said Robert Davis, 63, who had travelled from Cincinnati, Ohio. ""There may be another black American president, but this will always be the first time.""  He was part of the throng at the Lincoln Memorial yesterday, destination for many of those who have come to see Barack Obama sworn in. Perhaps it was a way to place their desire to witness history in a historical context - close to the monument to the president who ended slavery, the site where Martin Luther King declared his dream of equality. In this, the fates have once again helped endow Obama's inauguration with an epic quality. He accepted the Democratic party's presidential nomination on the 45th anniversary, to the day, of the ""I have a dream"" speech. Yesterday, the day before Obama's installation as president, was Martin Luther King day. It added to the sense that America will today reach some kind of fulfilment, even redemption. ""King's dream became a reality,"" said Davis, his voice wavering in the cold. But it is not only black America's pride in Obama that is lending extra magic to today's act of sorcery. For one thing, there is the sheer eagerness to see the back of the present incumbent, George W Bush, who marked a ""mostly private"" last day in office yesterday by granting a cluster of pardons and making a series of goodbye calls to world leaders. No president has left office with lower approval ratings. For another, it is the fact that today's inauguration ceremony will not need to deploy too much magical power to persuade Americans to see Barack Obama as their president. Proof of that is palpable in his dizzyingly high poll ratings, with 79% optimistic about the next four years, according to the New York Times, a degree of goodwill that trumps the numbers that greeted the previous five presidents. The same poll found high levels of hope among those who voted for Obama's opponent, John McCain. It's partly because he has, in the three months of transition, done much to reassure them, appointing solid, centrist figures, including more than one Republican, to key positions. Last night he was due to attend three private dinners honouring the public service of his vice-president-to-be, Joe Biden, and Republicans Colin Powell and McCain himself. But it's also because the new president does seem blessed with the poise and stature that befits a head of state. Yesterday he again looked the part, visiting wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed army medical centre, then rolling up his sleeves and helping paint the walls at a homeless shelter for teenagers in north-east Washington - with Martin Luther King's son at his side. Obama had urged his vast email database of supporters to follow his lead and engage in a day of community service. Among those heeding the call was Michelle Obama who, with her daughters, went to Washington's RFK stadium to join 15,000 volunteers in assembling ""care packages"" for US soldiers serving abroad.  But, in a visit to the Calvin Coolidge high school, Obama said that this could not be a ""one-day affair"". He added: ""If we're waiting for someone else to do something, it never gets done."" That prefigures what is set to be one of Obama's major themes today: responsibility, the notion that government cannot solve America's vast problems alone, that everyone has to pitch in. That fits nicely with Obama's insistence that he will be able to work no miracles as president; that tackling the deepening economic crisis will be the stuff of long, hard work. The polls suggest Americans understand that. They know there will be no overnight fix. And they applaud their incoming president for saying so. Indeed, his caution and realism only make them admire him more.  Such are the paradoxes of a man who insists he is no magician - but who will stand today at the centre of something magical."

Extremists have to abandon, or at any rate disguise, their passions, and move to positions as close to being all things to all fickle voters as they can invent. That's how Tony Blair made Labour electable. The coalitions of continental Europe are built round the same inescapable proposition. In such politics, nuance replaces conviction, and manoeuvre boldness, as the identifying marks of a winning team. What's going on in America as the 2004 election begins is unnervingly the opposite. It's one of the more extraordinary spectacles a political scientist, or journalist, let alone a professional politician, could encounter. George Bush is running his campaign from the same fringe position as the one he has adopted for his presidency.  This is a hard-right administration offering virtually no concessions to the soothing niceties that might make it more electorally attractive to voters who are not Republicans. Its tax policy is grotesquely loaded against the masses and in favour of the rich. Its bias on the environment unfailingly comes out on the side of the big commercial interests. It is daily tearing up tracts of policy and practice that protected the basic rights of people snared in the justice system. It is the hardest right administration since Herbert Hoover's from a very different era. And, which is the point, delights in being so. There is no apology or cover-up.  But even that isn't the most striking thing about the set-up as it now stands. For this we have to turn to the Democrats. Unlike Bush, many Democrats are sticking to the conventional wisdom. They grope for some kind of centre ground. But so far has the territory shifted, thanks to the Republicans' shameless stakeout on the hard right, that their quest continues to drain their party of most of its meaning and any of its capacity to inspire.  The rules are being observed, but we find that in some circumstances these rules are a fallacy. They draw a party so far into the orbit of its rival as to render itself meaningless as anything except a political machine of variable potency around the country. Yet the dominant mode of most presidential candidates is still to cling to the kind of centrism that defines them at best as Bush-lite, at worst as people who have nothing to say that could send the smallest shiver up the spine of afloating voter.  One should hesitate to second-guess all these massively professional politicians, laden with polls. But their reflex looks to me as unnecessary as it is self-destructive. One way to respond to Bush's rewrite of the rule book - which covers more contentious ground than Ronald Reagan's campaigns ever did, for example - may be to meekly accept the new setting for old maxims. The other is to treat the maxims, in present times, as a snare.   For one thing, many Democrats seem to have forgotten that they did win the election last time. For four years it has been idle to challenge the Florida vote and the bizarre workings of the electoral college, but now is the time to recall that in 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore's progressive version of the future than Bush's more conservative one. Bush was still posing as a bit centrist then, and Gore was scarcely a raving liberal. Gore mostly stuck to the Clinton third way doctrine that had taken the Democrats away from the narrowest version of their past. But there was a left-right choice, and more Americans voted left than right.  In most systems, that would have been another reason for the technical winners to gravitate towards the centre. Since that did not happen, it is instead an excellent reason for the losers to rediscover their raison d'tre. Yet most of them seem mesmerised with terror at the prospect, and full of guff about Democratic ""values"" which they take to excuse them from advancing any awkward Democratic policies.  The Iraq war is to blame for this, but only partly. It is Bush's alibi for everything   else. To the extent that voters dislike his right-wingery on domestic matters, Iraq and terrorism give cover to the Great Leader. We may be sure he will exploit this until the day of the election. It puts Democrats in a bind, though something has changed when dreary Joe Lieberman, an early war supporter, now feels it necessary to bleat defensively that his was a ""principled"" position, and posturing John Kerry - probably the favourite as things stand - calibrates a position edging finely away from believer to mealy-mouthed critic. Another year of Baghdad body bags, with Osama bin Laden still at large, and the politics of the war cannot be so neatly predicted.  For any Democrat to take advantage of Bush's waning popularity and overcome his vast campaign finances, however, he must have something to say. There needs to be some clarity, on all fronts. The other day, the same edition of the New York Times carried stories saying that neither young African-Americans nor the Boston Irish could any longer be counted on as part of the core vote. Is this heresy surprising when nobody knows with any certainty what Democrats stand for? If a party can't fire up its core vote, it will be deader quicker than if it can't draw in people who've never voted for it before. Watching what Bush has done to both the economy and the constitution, it should be easy for a Democrat to come up with soundbites and articles of simple faith to inspire a few more than the millions of Americans who voted for Gore last time.  Wiseacres continue to pretend otherwise. They think Howard Dean, the most lefty of the candidates, and former governor of the state of Vermont, could never get elected. Transfixed by the attractions of triangulated centrism, they're prepared to have its geometry laid out exclusively by their opponents. They come out against a bit of the Bush tax plan but not all of it. They're all but silent, as are much of the media, on what anti-terrorism psychosis is doing to civil liberties.  Yet the Republicans didn't get where they are today by such half-baked timidity. The challenge they make is for the life and death of the soul of the America very many Americans still believe in. What their opponents need is a leader whose voice rings more eloquently than Bush's - surely not the hardest contest to win. That won't happen until they abandon their backing and filling, and their belief that being a Democrat no longer adds up to anything more than a milder version of their enemies.  ""Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice ... Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" Barry Goldwater said that 40 years ago. It was the start of the recovery of the right. The words now belong rather exactly in the other side's mouth. If they came out of Senator Kerry's this autumn, they'd make him sound less like a calculating wimp."
1,"A week ago, at a reception in one of London's dowdier hotels, Maryam Namazie received a cheque and a certificate stating that she was Secularist of the Year 2005. The audience from the National Secular Society cheered, but no one else noticed.At first glance, the wider indifference wasn't surprising. Everyone is presenting everyone else with prizes these days - even journalists get them. If coverage was given to all award winners, there would be no space left in the papers for news. On top of that, secularism is still an eccentric cause. Despite the privileges of the established churches, this is one of the most irreligious countries on Earth. The bishops have power but no influence, and the notion that you need a tough-minded movement to combat religious influence still feels quaint.Like republicanism, secularism is an ideal which can enthuse the few while leaving the many cold.The rise of the Christian right in the United States and the Islamic right everywhere, of faith schools and religious censorship is breaking down complacency. The 7 July bombings should have blown it to pieces. But the Ealing comedy caricature of a kind vicar, who may be a bit silly but remains intrinsically decent, is still most people's picture of the religious in England, not least because there is truth in it. (It's a different matter in Northern Ireland and on the west coast of Scotland, for obvious reasons.)For all that, Maryam Namazie's obscurity remains baffling. She ought to be a liberal poster girl. Her life has been that of a feminist militant who fights the oppression of women wherever she finds it. She was born in Tehran, but had to flee with her family when the Iranian revolution brought the mullahs to power. After graduating in America, she went to work with the poor in the Sudan. When the Islamists seized control, she established an underground human rights network. Her cover was blown and she had to run once again. She's been a full-time campaigner for the rights of the Iranian diaspora, helping refugees across the world and banging on to anyone who will listen about the vileness of its treatment of women.When an Iranian judge hanged a 16-year-old girl for having sex outside marriage - I mean literally hanged her; he put the noose round her neck himself - Namazie organised global protests. Her best rhetorical weapon is her description of the obsessiveness of theocracy. The law in Iran not only allows women to be stoned, she says, but it specifies the size of the stones to be used; they mustn't be too small in case it takes too long to kill her and the mob gets bored; but mustn't be too big either, in case she is dispatched immediately and the mob is denied the sado-sexual pleasure of seeing her suffer.She's media-friendly and literate, not least because she runs the London-based International TV English whose programmes have a large following in the Middle East. Yet one of the most important feminists from the developing world has never been on Woman's Hour. I searched our huge cuttings database and could find only one mention of her in the national press over the past 10 years. Right-thinking, left-leaning people have backed away from Maryam Namazie because she is just as willing to tackle their tolerance of oppression as the oppressors themselves.It was the decision of broad-minded politicians in Ottawa to allow Sharia courts in Canada which did it for her. They said if they were not established, the Muslim minority would be marginalised and to say otherwise was racism pure and simple.After years of hearing this postmodern twaddle, Namazie flipped. Why was it, she asked, that supposed liberals always give 'precedence to cultural and religious norms, however reactionary, over the human being and her rights'? Why was it that they always pretended that other cultures were sealed boxes without conflicts of their own and took 'the most reactionary segment of that community' as representative of the belief and culture of the whole.In a ringing passage, which should be pinned to the noticeboards of every cultural studies faculty and Whitehall ministry, she declared that the problem with cultural relativism was that it endorsed the racism of low expectations.'It promotes tolerance and respect for so-called minority opinions and beliefs, rather than respect for human beings. Human beings are worthy of the highest respect, but not all opinions and beliefs are worthy of respect and tolerance. There are some who believe in fascism, white supremacy, the inferiority of women. Must they be respected?'Richard J Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge, pointed out in Defence of History that if you take the relativist position to its conclusion and believe there's no such thing as truth and all cultures are equally valid, you have no weapons to fight the Holocaust denier or Ku Klux Klansmen.Namazie is on the right side of the great intellectual struggle of our time between incompatible versions of liberalism. One follows the fine and necessary principle of tolerance, but ends up having to tolerate the oppression of women, say, or gays in foreign cultures while opposing misogyny and homophobia in its own. (Or 'liberalism for the liberals and cannibalism for the cannibals!' as philosopher Martin Hollis elegantly described the hypocrisy of the manoeuvre.) The alternative is to support universal human rights and believe that if the oppression of women is wrong, it is wrong everywhere.The gulf between the two is unbridgeable. Although the argument is rarely put as baldly as I made it above, you can see it breaking out everywhere across the liberal-left. Trade union leaders stormed out of the anti-war movement when they discovered its leadership had nothing to say about the trade unionists who were demanding workers' rights in Iraq and being tortured and murdered by the 'insurgents' for their presumption.Former supporters of Ken Livingstone reacted first with bewilderment and then steady contempt when he betrayed Arab liberals and embraced the Islamic religious right. The government's plans to ban the incitement of religious hatred have created an opposition which spans left and right and whose members have found they have more in common with each other than with people on 'their side'.As Namazie knows, the dispute can't stay in the background for much longer. There's an almighty smash-up coming and not before time.","On Wednesday, Clare Short stood up in the Commons with a reasonable expectation of being asked about the great issues which fill the days of her International Development Department. The bloodbath in the Middle East was topical, as was the war in the Congo, and famine, drought and flood. Yet none of these man-made disasters disturbed Conservative MPs. They wanted to get down to the real business of shouting about sugar. When the conversation was in danger of turning to such trivial matters as whether aid should be given to kleptomaniac dictators, James Paice interrupted with a 'May I take the Right Hon lady back to the issue of sugar?' When the religious war in Sudan, which has cost 1,500,000 lives, was raised, Cheryl Gillan butted in with 'Of the 48 least and less-developed countries, 21 produce sugar, and Sudan has the largest sugar production among them'.  A faintly bewildered Short sat down and Tony Blair took the floor to be confronted by another sweet-toothed Tory. John Greenway wasted one of the few opportunities he will get in his career to interrogate the Prime Minister by hitting him with a sugar question. Blair did not quite reply 'Sugar? Come again?' but few would have blamed him if he had.  The Conservatives addressed the PM and Short in the concerned, simpering tone of the new Portilloised party. Caribbean islands faced devastation and impoverishment, they warned, and for a moment a cynic could be convinced that they truly cared about the plight of the Third World. It is always worth counting your fingers after a compassionate Conservative has squeezed your hand. In this instance, the reckoning shows that the Conservatives have allied with sugar interests and the most pampered farmers in Europe in an attempt to destroy an initiative to give back to the poorest people on the planet a little of the money we screw from them. They may yet succeed.  The World Trade Organisation can now meet only behind regiments of riot police because of the disgust at how the wretched of the Earth are treated. The free trade enforced by the Washington consensus flows in one direction. The poor must open their markets to Western corporations, but the favour is rarely returned.  Oxfam estimates that backward countries lose $700 billion (460bn) a year because of tariffs and barriers in Europe, North America and Japan. Third World farmers suffer most, not only from the formal charges but from the constraints health faddism brings. The European Union insists that dairy products, for example, must come from cows which have been mechanically milked and thus bans virtually every Indian smallholder from exporting.  The WTO has lived up to its reputation for being a protection racket for the wealthy and done nothing. Its failure   provoked Pascal Lamy, the European Trade Commissioner, to be generous to the South. The poorest 48 countries, mainly in Africa, should have unrestricted access to EU markets, he decided. There would be no tariffs and no quotas. They would be free to sell any product except arms.  As Short herself admits, the largess from Brussels will not change the world. The 600 million people living in the 48 nations have an average annual income of 191 - or 52 pence a day. Their importing and exporting accounts for a mere   0.4 per cent of world trade. As far as global capitalism is concerned, they might as well be dead - and many soon will be.  Nevertheless, Lamy's gesture would at least bring benefits to a few and end the enormous hypocrisy of a 'free' market which becomes very restrictive indeed when the traders and producers have black or brown skins. Unfortunately, he will probably be defeated by the power of the ferocious sugar lobby.  There is no reason why Europe needs to grow sugar beet rather than import sugar cane from the Tropics. In the Napoleonic and First and Second World Wars, beet could be presented as a vital resource which would help frustrate a blockade.  Any conceivable modern war will either be nuclear and over pretty quickly or a guerrilla conflict which will not close the ports. Yet through production-limiting quotas, minimum prices for farmers and import restrictions, European sugar business continues to demand and receive formidable protection. The prices for consumers and industry are always twice and often three times as high as world prices.  Only the Caribbean plantations - built on slavery, the sugar industry's first contribution to a global market - are allowed to export without restriction, hence the Tory predictions of impoverishment and the insistence of the Tate &amp; Lyle press office that journalists should concentrate on the threat to the West Indies. Neither says that Lamy merely wants to accord the poorest countries the same rights as the Caribbean. He is not trying to take West Indian rights away.  Anyone who believes that the Conservatives are motivated by altruism should look at who is behind the campaign. The National Farmers Union and British Sugar, the makers of Silver Spoon, are lobbying Parliament hard. The thought of any concession to impoverished countries is intolerable.  They won't get anywhere in Britain if Blair stands firm, although I accept that that is always a giant 'if'. But the Tories and the industry are part of a pan-European movement which has a good chance of persuading the EU to forget about Lamy's benevolence, probably with the aid a French or German veto.  The Third World and consumers will still be ripped off, but at least the Conservative Party will have re-established its role as clients of the sugar industry. From 1945 onwards, Tate &amp; Lyle was a generous corporate sponsor. In 1996, with the party heading for defeat, the company spread its bets in a tripartisan fashion by funding New Labour and the Liberal Democrats as well as their traditional friends.  This year, Michael Portillo rebuilt bridges when he promised to abolish Labour taxes on companies which move money offshore, after Tate &amp; Lyle, among others, had complained of the pain it would suffer from being made to pay its way. Bowen Wells, the Tory chairman of the International Development Committee, was an adviser to Michael Ashcroft, the offshore banker whose donations to the party brought him a peerage. Welles lobbied on Tate &amp; Lyle's behalf. The company enjoyed the indulgent tax benefits offered by Ashcroft's Bank of Belize. Wells joined the assault on Short in the Commons last week.  All of which puts Conservative complaints about military cooperation in Europe into perspective. Although the party is always ready to denounce real and imaginary Euromadness, scepticism has its limits. It will fight to the last ditch to defend the most pernicious Europrivileges for its supporters regardless of the consequences for an electorate and an impoverished South which  must pay for them.   Cardinal Irvine, the Lord High Chancellor of all England, art collector, Blair placeman and millionaire corporate lawyer, cuts a faintly preposterous figure when he poses as a working-class hero.  For all his unsuitability for the role, he explains that cuts in legal aid to the poorest as an act of class war against 'fat cat' lawyers on behalf of the oppressed masses rather than an assault on the welfare state. In September he took the cant of pseudo-populism further when he effectively banned defendants without means from being represented by Queen's Counsel, the most distinguished advocates. Even when they are up against a murder charge and a mandatory life sentence, they must now make do with junior barristers. Once again, meanness was justified as a legitimate defence against the greed of grasping lawyers.  As I noted the other week, Irvine was denying QCs to the swinish multitude while using public money to hire a QC to defend his reputation. What I did not realise was how much money was being spent on saving His Eminence's face.  Irvine is appealing against an employment tribunal ruling that he was guilty of indirect sex discrimination when he appointed Garry Hart as his special adviser. Hart, who worked for the enormously expensive City law firm, Herbert Smith, would push large briefs in Irvine's direction, when the Lord Chancellor was one of the fattest felines at the Bar.  Hart is the godfather of the PM's daughter and, what with one thing and another, you can see why the Lord Chancellor was fond of him.  To overturn the tribunal's impertinent rulings that unadvertised jobs and secret appointments guarantee discrimination, Irvine has hired Sir Sydney Kentridge QC, one of the best lawyers in London. Sir Sydney costs 500 an hour (135 times the minimum wage). If he is working long hours, he offers a discount. You can book his services from dawn to dusk and beyond for a mere 5,000 a day.  Sir Sydney will be assisted by Richard McManus QC, who charges a paltry 250 an hour. Just as one Jag is not enough for Prescott, one QC is not enough for Irvine - although it is one too many for the poor."
0,"A week ago, at a reception in one of London's dowdier hotels, Maryam Namazie received a cheque and a certificate stating that she was Secularist of the Year 2005. The audience from the National Secular Society cheered, but no one else noticed.At first glance, the wider indifference wasn't surprising. Everyone is presenting everyone else with prizes these days - even journalists get them. If coverage was given to all award winners, there would be no space left in the papers for news. On top of that, secularism is still an eccentric cause. Despite the privileges of the established churches, this is one of the most irreligious countries on Earth. The bishops have power but no influence, and the notion that you need a tough-minded movement to combat religious influence still feels quaint.Like republicanism, secularism is an ideal which can enthuse the few while leaving the many cold.The rise of the Christian right in the United States and the Islamic right everywhere, of faith schools and religious censorship is breaking down complacency. The 7 July bombings should have blown it to pieces. But the Ealing comedy caricature of a kind vicar, who may be a bit silly but remains intrinsically decent, is still most people's picture of the religious in England, not least because there is truth in it. (It's a different matter in Northern Ireland and on the west coast of Scotland, for obvious reasons.)For all that, Maryam Namazie's obscurity remains baffling. She ought to be a liberal poster girl. Her life has been that of a feminist militant who fights the oppression of women wherever she finds it. She was born in Tehran, but had to flee with her family when the Iranian revolution brought the mullahs to power. After graduating in America, she went to work with the poor in the Sudan. When the Islamists seized control, she established an underground human rights network. Her cover was blown and she had to run once again. She's been a full-time campaigner for the rights of the Iranian diaspora, helping refugees across the world and banging on to anyone who will listen about the vileness of its treatment of women.When an Iranian judge hanged a 16-year-old girl for having sex outside marriage - I mean literally hanged her; he put the noose round her neck himself - Namazie organised global protests. Her best rhetorical weapon is her description of the obsessiveness of theocracy. The law in Iran not only allows women to be stoned, she says, but it specifies the size of the stones to be used; they mustn't be too small in case it takes too long to kill her and the mob gets bored; but mustn't be too big either, in case she is dispatched immediately and the mob is denied the sado-sexual pleasure of seeing her suffer.She's media-friendly and literate, not least because she runs the London-based International TV English whose programmes have a large following in the Middle East. Yet one of the most important feminists from the developing world has never been on Woman's Hour. I searched our huge cuttings database and could find only one mention of her in the national press over the past 10 years. Right-thinking, left-leaning people have backed away from Maryam Namazie because she is just as willing to tackle their tolerance of oppression as the oppressors themselves.It was the decision of broad-minded politicians in Ottawa to allow Sharia courts in Canada which did it for her. They said if they were not established, the Muslim minority would be marginalised and to say otherwise was racism pure and simple.After years of hearing this postmodern twaddle, Namazie flipped. Why was it, she asked, that supposed liberals always give 'precedence to cultural and religious norms, however reactionary, over the human being and her rights'? Why was it that they always pretended that other cultures were sealed boxes without conflicts of their own and took 'the most reactionary segment of that community' as representative of the belief and culture of the whole.In a ringing passage, which should be pinned to the noticeboards of every cultural studies faculty and Whitehall ministry, she declared that the problem with cultural relativism was that it endorsed the racism of low expectations.'It promotes tolerance and respect for so-called minority opinions and beliefs, rather than respect for human beings. Human beings are worthy of the highest respect, but not all opinions and beliefs are worthy of respect and tolerance. There are some who believe in fascism, white supremacy, the inferiority of women. Must they be respected?'Richard J Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge, pointed out in Defence of History that if you take the relativist position to its conclusion and believe there's no such thing as truth and all cultures are equally valid, you have no weapons to fight the Holocaust denier or Ku Klux Klansmen.Namazie is on the right side of the great intellectual struggle of our time between incompatible versions of liberalism. One follows the fine and necessary principle of tolerance, but ends up having to tolerate the oppression of women, say, or gays in foreign cultures while opposing misogyny and homophobia in its own. (Or 'liberalism for the liberals and cannibalism for the cannibals!' as philosopher Martin Hollis elegantly described the hypocrisy of the manoeuvre.) The alternative is to support universal human rights and believe that if the oppression of women is wrong, it is wrong everywhere.The gulf between the two is unbridgeable. Although the argument is rarely put as baldly as I made it above, you can see it breaking out everywhere across the liberal-left. Trade union leaders stormed out of the anti-war movement when they discovered its leadership had nothing to say about the trade unionists who were demanding workers' rights in Iraq and being tortured and murdered by the 'insurgents' for their presumption.Former supporters of Ken Livingstone reacted first with bewilderment and then steady contempt when he betrayed Arab liberals and embraced the Islamic religious right. The government's plans to ban the incitement of religious hatred have created an opposition which spans left and right and whose members have found they have more in common with each other than with people on 'their side'.As Namazie knows, the dispute can't stay in the background for much longer. There's an almighty smash-up coming and not before time.","The chances of Gordon Brown ever becoming prime minister have diminished, are diminishing - and will continue to diminish inexorably. A sad, sad song. It's always tough when a hugely talented professional sees his heart's desire slip away. But it is also - no ducking, weaving or glossing - Gordon's own fault: bad politics as well as bad vibrations. Take a few findings from the latest Telegraph/YouGov poll. Do you approve of the government's record to date? No, say 68%. What about issues like Europe and taxation? The Tories are in the lead. And economic competence, the rock of reputations prudently built? Just 32% have kept faith with Brown. And 31% (since you ask) would prefer to see Michael Howard on the Treasury bridge. There's something of the night for all concerned here.  Now polls, of course, can be shrugged away. The chancel-lor's spinners say he'll shrug for Britain today when he tells the Social Market Forum that his ""prudent and cautious"" spending plans are on course, needing no new taxes; that the dear old ""fundamentals are sound""; that while our share prices are only 48% down, Germany's have tumbled a whopping 67%. But this, alas, is politics, not comparative economics. This is show-business. Listen, therefore, to the dismal tinkle of luck and applause running out.  He said there'd be no more boom and bust. That is not how it feels. He took an early pop at the pension funds. Now they're becoming a national crisis, staggering from pillar to post, demolishing ordinary dreams as they go. Just as the taxation tide turns, so last year's national insurance rises snap into place. Just as the cash for public services comes on stream, so the firemen stoke a different boiler. Just as congestion charges arrive, so the Central line goes awol. And then there is university funding.  Every problem that seemed so breezy when there was growth and confidence, in short, now comes glooming round to Gordon's door. Things could be more awful, naturally. That's always true. Yet lustre, once lost, is powerful hard to get shining again.  In a normal Westminster world, you'd know what would happen next. A threat to the chancellor would be a threat to the prime minister and continuing governance. It would thus be loyally batted away unless (like Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson) ritual sacrifices were more the order of the day. A chancellor is there to be defended until it's time, in extremis, to ditch him. But Mr Brown and Mr Blair don't live in a ""normal"" world.  They are both big beasts. Almost a decade ago, they sat over lunch in Islington and made the Granita accord. I won't stand against you for Labour leader (and thus prospective PM) if you quit half-way through your second term and let me have a go. Was it ever quite as neat as that? The old Granita restaurant was a famously noisy, clattery place. Maybe Tony dropped his bread roll at the wrong moment? Maybe Gordon found a fly in his soup? Still ... the legend and the black looks live on.  What we've had for almost six years now isn't the traditional line of command, prime minister down to chancellor, but more a division of the Whitehall realm into two rival kingdoms. The leaders have their own camps and followers. They jockey, needle and probe. They are allies in public and snarlers or sniffers behind the arras. Like North and South Korea, they always need watching. And it's Granita time, time to move over. High noon.  But is Mr Blair going to pack his bags and, like Peter Foster, depart for distant parts? Of course not. That was always an illusion. A disastrous war in Iraq might carry him off - but, in harsh practicality if not morality, it's far more likely that Saddam will crumple and a string of Iraqi scientists thereafter bear witness to the horrors averted. There's no alternative to a continuing Tony. There are, however, plenty of reasons why a continuing Gordon may not be so fireproof. Who wants a magician who's lost his wand? Who wants a baleful, brooding problem when fresh starts are easier?  It is because the realm was divided, because the pieces were scrapped over and parcelled out, that Gordon Brown is suddenly so vulnerable. Traditionally, when a prime minister has a night of the long knives with his neighbour, it is the PM's own status and policies that also appear in the frame. Sacking has its costs. But here the equation is different. Because Brown manifestly runs his own five tests, his own prescriptions for the markets, his own private funding initiatives and target-setting squads, because they are his and not Blair's, so the policies and the man can be simultaneously removed without that damage: a liberation rather than an assassination.  Would there be crisis and flak when the moment came? Inescapably. But it would also set the prime minister free, on course to be his own man with his own chancellor for a third term. It would allow New Labour a new beginning. And to see the logic, you need only consider the alternative: no change, no joy, animosity as usual. Who can possibly settle for another six years of this? Who would want to?  There's the fault with Mr Brown. He shouldn't have believed his own publicity. He should have shifted himself, in triumph, to foreign secretary or deputy PM a year ago. He should have remained forever Mr Boom not Mr Bust. He should have known that, like Jim Callaghan, his time would come if he was loyal and efficient and on the team, not a king over the water. He should, simply, have been smarter."
1,"On Wednesday, Clare Short stood up in the Commons with a reasonable expectation of being asked about the great issues which fill the days of her International Development Department. The bloodbath in the Middle East was topical, as was the war in the Congo, and famine, drought and flood. Yet none of these man-made disasters disturbed Conservative MPs. They wanted to get down to the real business of shouting about sugar. When the conversation was in danger of turning to such trivial matters as whether aid should be given to kleptomaniac dictators, James Paice interrupted with a 'May I take the Right Hon lady back to the issue of sugar?' When the religious war in Sudan, which has cost 1,500,000 lives, was raised, Cheryl Gillan butted in with 'Of the 48 least and less-developed countries, 21 produce sugar, and Sudan has the largest sugar production among them'.  A faintly bewildered Short sat down and Tony Blair took the floor to be confronted by another sweet-toothed Tory. John Greenway wasted one of the few opportunities he will get in his career to interrogate the Prime Minister by hitting him with a sugar question. Blair did not quite reply 'Sugar? Come again?' but few would have blamed him if he had.  The Conservatives addressed the PM and Short in the concerned, simpering tone of the new Portilloised party. Caribbean islands faced devastation and impoverishment, they warned, and for a moment a cynic could be convinced that they truly cared about the plight of the Third World. It is always worth counting your fingers after a compassionate Conservative has squeezed your hand.

Rob Daves, the paper's pollster, saw the crowd gathering on the front steps as he came out for his lunchtime jog. He didn't realise why they were there and went off on his run. By the time he got back, they were gone, which was just as well because much of the rage and derision was directed at him. 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, Rob Daves has got to go!' the Republican pickets chanted. 'Liberals!' they screamed at hacks leaving for a bite to eat. It may not sound much of an insult to you, but in conservative America alleging that journalists are liberals is almost as wounding as alleging that they are communists, which the demonstrators proceeded to do when they switched to the chant of 'Star and Sickle, you're in a pickle'.  The Star and Tribune had a run a poll saying that John Kerry had a 9 per cent lead over George W Bush in Minnesota. Rival polls claimed the race was tied. The paper's editor had endorsed Kerry, and the Republicans believed they had uncovered a liberal plot to convince their supporters that there was no point turning out to vote.  Over in New York, moveon.org, an alliance of two million Bush loathers who, like the Minnesota Republicans, are unlikely to get through the tension of election night without a nervous collapse, paid for an attack ad in the New York Times. 'Why Does America's Top Pollster Keep Getting it Wrong?' it wanted to know. Gallup's polls, used by CNN and USA Today, had given Bush a 14 point lead but other polls conducted at the same time put it at around 3 per cent. The Kerryites noted that George Gallup Jr, son of the poll's founder and director of its research centre, was a born-again Christian of the nosiest type who had said earlier this year that 'the most profound purpose of polls is to see how people are responding to God'.  'We thought the purpose is to faithfully and factually report public opinion,' moveon.org retorted with a sniff.  You get the picture. Religious fundamentalists in the polling industry back God and Bush and do nothing to dispel the helpful illusion that the President is invincible.  The polling companies dismissed the protests as overheated allegations from an angry campaign. But the demonstrators were on to something. How can one poll give Kerry a nine point lead in Minnesota and others give him no lead at all? Why do CNN viewers hear that Bush is cruising to a landslide victory, while he's in the tightest race imaginable on other channels? Why for that matter has Labour's poll share in the past month bounced between 28 per cent and 39 per cent according to which newspaper your read? Are any of these figures true or false? And if newspapers and broadcasters can't say they're true, why do they pretend that they are facts on a par with the statement 'Yasser Arafat was admitted to hospital last week'?  The pollsters can't all be right, but they may all be wrong, and a few American journalists have the guts to admit it.  Sceptics in the media have always seen opinion polls as crooked: not as deceitful as horoscopes, but way short of the exacting standards met by the racing tipsters. Where the Minnesota Republicans and the New York liberals get it wrong is to assume the crookedness is the result of political bias. To be sure, pollsters are a part of the process which sets 'the agenda' and determines which political positions are 'appropriate' and which politicians are 'credible', but most are honest by their own lights. It's just that their lights are dimming with each passing year.  Last week the Washington Post 's pollster Richard Morin wrote a long, despairing piece whose headline 'Don't Ask Me' said it all. In Britain, the campaign polls may have underestimated Tory support in the last three elections, but the exit polls, which have far more money behind them, were reasonably close in 1997 and 2001. Morin noted that in the US, even the exit polls were a shambles.  The reason why pollsters fear their racket is 'on the way to extinction' is that the public is fed up with being pestered by hucksters. If you think about it, talking to a polling company is an odd way to behave. Strangers ask you to give them time and personal information for nothing so that they can profit from it. Once the pollsters had few competitors, now everyone's at it. In the vast United States the only way to sample the electorate is by phone.  But the polling companies aren't the only people cold calling at the precise moment when the dinner has boiled over and the baby's nappy exploded. Telemarketers infest the country. To combat them, there are call screening systems and attempts in state legislatures to make cold calling illegal. Those who can't stop the pollsters getting through are fighting back with ingenious technologies.  The Washington Post told the sad story of Rick Klaastad, a market researcher for a polling company in Oregon, who dialled an elderly man on his contact list. 'Apparently he has some electronic device attached to the phone and the next thing I hear was this loud, painful sound. It was as about as bad as it gets - imagine turning an FM stereo up full blast with a really good set of speakers. It bruised my eardrum.'  Huge numbers refuse to talk to pollsters. Morin found that 'in some surveys fewer than one in five calls produces a completed interview - raising doubts whether such polls accurately reflect the views of the public or merely report the opinions of stay-at-home Americans who are too bored, too infirm or too lonely to hang up.'  To put it at its politest, I think it's fair to say that American polls aren't want scientists call random samples.  Nor are they in Britain. Whenever the media is forced to ask whether findings that 57.2 per cent of the population don't trust Tony Blair or 12.8 per cent of twentysomething women have given up one-night stands after a three-in-a-bed romp with a two-timing love rat are true, it always quotes pollsters. What journalists neglect to mention is that the polling industry makes its real money from business, not newspapers or television. If CEOs began to suspect that the beguilingly precise findings on the existence of niche markets were false, tens of millions of pounds would be lost.  If you leave the self-interested defenders of the industry behind and turn to objective outsiders such as Roger Jowell, who runs the British Social Attitudes Survey, you find that they have been saying for years that opinion polls aren't random samples.  He explains the persistent failure to get Tory support right in campaign polls by the fact that a sizeable number of Conservatives think that time is money and don't see why they should give something for nothing. They brush past the market researcher standing in the street with a tight smile. Labour supporters and Liberal Democrats are kinder people who are more likely to help out a stranger.  Whether they will continue to do so is doubtful. Commerce is crowding into private space via junk mail, cold calls, texted adverts and the street confrontations arranged by those lovable charities. Cold calling has prejudiced Americans against telephone polling. Chugging and other forms of aggressive begging are likely to prejudice a fair chunk of the British against the poor woman in the shopping centre trying to scratch a living wage from Mori.  A lot flows from the decline of polling. First, readers who are close to tears because most US polls give Bush a slight lead can relax until election night. Only two of the 11 final national polls were right in 2000 - and there's no reason to believe that that dismal record will be bettered. (Conversely, Bush supporters - a minority among you, I suspect - shouldn't be too cocksure, defeat or a landslide is as likely as a narrow win.)  Second, all the focus-group policies the government uses to please the electorate may not only be wrong in principle but a failure in practice because the public may very well not be pleased in the least.  Finally, if the next election is as messy as a few of us suspect, with three-cornered contests taking place across the country and voters deciding whether to vote tactically against Blair or the Tories, the polls will be all important to people who want to work out what the consequences of their vote will be. They should know in advance that there's a fair chance that the polls will be tosh."
0,"On Wednesday, Clare Short stood up in the Commons with a reasonable expectation of being asked about the great issues which fill the days of her International Development Department. The bloodbath in the Middle East was topical, as was the war in the Congo, and famine, drought and flood. Yet none of these man-made disasters disturbed Conservative MPs. They wanted to get down to the real business of shouting about sugar. When the conversation was in danger of turning to such trivial matters as whether aid should be given to kleptomaniac dictators, James Paice interrupted with a 'May I take the Right Hon lady back to the issue of sugar?' When the religious war in Sudan, which has cost 1,500,000 lives, was raised, Cheryl Gillan butted in with 'Of the 48 least and less-developed countries, 21 produce sugar, and Sudan has the largest sugar production among them'.  A faintly bewildered Short sat down and Tony Blair took the floor to be confronted by another sweet-toothed Tory. John Greenway wasted one of the few opportunities he will get in his career to interrogate the Prime Minister by hitting him with a sugar question. Blair did not quite reply 'Sugar? Come again?' but few would have blamed him if he had.  The Conservatives addressed the PM and Short in the concerned, simpering tone of the new Portilloised party. Caribbean islands faced devastation and impoverishment, they warned, and for a moment a cynic could be convinced that they truly cared about the plight of the Third World. It is always worth counting your fingers after a compassionate Conservative has squeezed your hand. In this instance, the reckoning shows that the Conservatives have allied with sugar interests and the most pampered farmers in Europe in an attempt to destroy an initiative to give back to the poorest people on the planet a little of the money we screw from them. They may yet succeed.  The World Trade Organisation can now meet only behind regiments of riot police because of the disgust at how the wretched of the Earth are treated. The free trade enforced by the Washington consensus flows in one direction. The poor must open their markets to Western corporations, but the favour is rarely returned.  Oxfam estimates that backward countries lose $700 billion (460bn) a year because of tariffs and barriers in Europe, North America and Japan. Third World farmers suffer most, not only from the formal charges but from the constraints health faddism brings. The European Union insists that dairy products, for example, must come from cows which have been mechanically milked and thus bans virtually every Indian smallholder from exporting.  The WTO has lived up to its reputation for being a protection racket for the wealthy and done nothing. Its failure   provoked Pascal Lamy, the European Trade Commissioner, to be generous to the South. The poorest 48 countries, mainly in Africa, should have unrestricted access to EU markets, he decided. There would be no tariffs and no quotas. They would be free to sell any product except arms.  As Short herself admits, the largess from Brussels will not change the world. The 600 million people living in the 48 nations have an average annual income of 191 - or 52 pence a day. Their importing and exporting accounts for a mere   0.4 per cent of world trade. As far as global capitalism is concerned, they might as well be dead - and many soon will be.  Nevertheless, Lamy's gesture would at least bring benefits to a few and end the enormous hypocrisy of a 'free' market which becomes very restrictive indeed when the traders and producers have black or brown skins. Unfortunately, he will probably be defeated by the power of the ferocious sugar lobby.  There is no reason why Europe needs to grow sugar beet rather than import sugar cane from the Tropics. In the Napoleonic and First and Second World Wars, beet could be presented as a vital resource which would help frustrate a blockade.  Any conceivable modern war will either be nuclear and over pretty quickly or a guerrilla conflict which will not close the ports. Yet through production-limiting quotas, minimum prices for farmers and import restrictions, European sugar business continues to demand and receive formidable protection. The prices for consumers and industry are always twice and often three times as high as world prices.  Only the Caribbean plantations - built on slavery, the sugar industry's first contribution to a global market - are allowed to export without restriction, hence the Tory predictions of impoverishment and the insistence of the Tate &amp; Lyle press office that journalists should concentrate on the threat to the West Indies. Neither says that Lamy merely wants to accord the poorest countries the same rights as the Caribbean. He is not trying to take West Indian rights away.  Anyone who believes that the Conservatives are motivated by altruism should look at who is behind the campaign. The National Farmers Union and British Sugar, the makers of Silver Spoon, are lobbying Parliament hard. The thought of any concession to impoverished countries is intolerable.  They won't get anywhere in Britain if Blair stands firm, although I accept that that is always a giant 'if'. But the Tories and the industry are part of a pan-European movement which has a good chance of persuading the EU to forget about Lamy's benevolence, probably with the aid a French or German veto.  The Third World and consumers will still be ripped off, but at least the Conservative Party will have re-established its role as clients of the sugar industry. From 1945 onwards, Tate &amp; Lyle was a generous corporate sponsor. In 1996, with the party heading for defeat, the company spread its bets in a tripartisan fashion by funding New Labour and the Liberal Democrats as well as their traditional friends.  This year, Michael Portillo rebuilt bridges when he promised to abolish Labour taxes on companies which move money offshore, after Tate &amp; Lyle, among others, had complained of the pain it would suffer from being made to pay its way. Bowen Wells, the Tory chairman of the International Development Committee, was an adviser to Michael Ashcroft, the offshore banker whose donations to the party brought him a peerage. Welles lobbied on Tate &amp; Lyle's behalf. The company enjoyed the indulgent tax benefits offered by Ashcroft's Bank of Belize. Wells joined the assault on Short in the Commons last week.  All of which puts Conservative complaints about military cooperation in Europe into perspective. Although the party is always ready to denounce real and imaginary Euromadness, scepticism has its limits. It will fight to the last ditch to defend the most pernicious Europrivileges for its supporters regardless of the consequences for an electorate and an impoverished South which  must pay for them.   Cardinal Irvine, the Lord High Chancellor of all England, art collector, Blair placeman and millionaire corporate lawyer, cuts a faintly preposterous figure when he poses as a working-class hero.  For all his unsuitability for the role, he explains that cuts in legal aid to the poorest as an act of class war against 'fat cat' lawyers on behalf of the oppressed masses rather than an assault on the welfare state. In September he took the cant of pseudo-populism further when he effectively banned defendants without means from being represented by Queen's Counsel, the most distinguished advocates. Even when they are up against a murder charge and a mandatory life sentence, they must now make do with junior barristers. Once again, meanness was justified as a legitimate defence against the greed of grasping lawyers.  As I noted the other week, Irvine was denying QCs to the swinish multitude while using public money to hire a QC to defend his reputation. What I did not realise was how much money was being spent on saving His Eminence's face.  Irvine is appealing against an employment tribunal ruling that he was guilty of indirect sex discrimination when he appointed Garry Hart as his special adviser. Hart, who worked for the enormously expensive City law firm, Herbert Smith, would push large briefs in Irvine's direction, when the Lord Chancellor was one of the fattest felines at the Bar.  Hart is the godfather of the PM's daughter and, what with one thing and another, you can see why the Lord Chancellor was fond of him.  To overturn the tribunal's impertinent rulings that unadvertised jobs and secret appointments guarantee discrimination, Irvine has hired Sir Sydney Kentridge QC, one of the best lawyers in London. Sir Sydney costs 500 an hour (135 times the minimum wage). If he is working long hours, he offers a discount. You can book his services from dawn to dusk and beyond for a mere 5,000 a day.  Sir Sydney will be assisted by Richard McManus QC, who charges a paltry 250 an hour. Just as one Jag is not enough for Prescott, one QC is not enough for Irvine - although it is one too many for the poor.","It was our first chance to see David Miliband in action after Hillary Clinton's confession of  if not love, then of a deep and profound attraction. In an interview with American Vogue, the US secretary of state came over all Mills &amp; Boon. ""If you saw him,"" she said, ""it would be a big crush. I mean, he is so vibrant, vital, attractive, smart! He's a really good guy, and he's so young!"" You can say that again. The foreign secretary is 18 years her junior. That makes her what is known these days as a ""cougar"", an older woman who preys on younger men. (I think I know the origin of this curious term, but it isn't very nice, and I would not dare repeat it in the Guardian.) So Mr Miliband must feel a lot more welcome in Foggy Bottom, Washington, than he does in the Commons. The only woman facing him in the chamber today was Anne Main (C, St Albans) and she is a mere seven years older than him. A puma perhaps, or a lynx. And in any case she didn't exactly look smitten. Nor did Sir Peter Tapsell, the Man Who Warned the World About Afghanistan. He too was clearly not suffering from a crush. As Mr Miliband spoke, Sir Peter's expression ranged from sceptical to cynical, from disbelief to scorn. Finally he rose to intervene with a pair of questions designed to upend our deliciously vibrant foreign secretary through his own superior knowledge of the North-West Frontier and associated hell holes. We learned how the Taliban were once supported only by the Pashtun. Now they were being driven into the Swat Valley and Baluchistan! You could almost see that vital, smart brain thinking: ""I've heard of them. They were on the news!"" But he thought too soon. Sir Peter, never to be out-manoeuvred in the Great Game went on, ""which are an immense distance away from the Durand frontier!"" What possible answer can there be to that? It was a magnificent example of one-upmanship, a meeting between Stephen Potter, Flashman and Google Earth. Mr Miliband had no reply, and moved swiftly on to the Israel/Palestine question and something he called ""the Clinton parameters"". Well, I thought, I've never heard them called that before. It turned out that he was referring to the gorgeous, pouting Hillary's husband, who showed the world his parameters back in 2000. Disappointing. Then William Hague rose and enjoyed himself hugely over the appointment of ""Cathy Ashton"", as  he claimed  Gordon Brown's third choice as EU high representative. Why, he said, the foreign secretary had been tempted by the job, for all the right reasons including ""his belief that the prime minister will soon be gone"". Peter Mandelson had also been put forward. Ministers would have a chance to deny this, but instead ""an icy stillness"" rose from the front bench. This would not just be a case of a rat leaving the sinking ship, but the lord high admiral himself departing  ""though we are reluctant to suggest new titles, because he might adopt them"". The Labour front bench collapsed in laughter. There is little love lost there."
1,"A few weeks ago furious protesters pounded on the windows of the head office of the  Minneapolis Star and Tribune, a respectable newspaper in the northern US state of Minnesota, whose journalists aren't used to being the targets of rage and derision. Rob Daves, the paper's pollster, saw the crowd gathering on the front steps as he came out for his lunchtime jog. He didn't realise why they were there and went off on his run. By the time he got back, they were gone, which was just as well because much of the rage and derision was directed at him. 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, Rob Daves has got to go!' the Republican pickets chanted. 'Liberals!' they screamed at hacks leaving for a bite to eat. It may not sound much of an insult to you, but in conservative America alleging that journalists are liberals is almost as wounding as alleging that they are communists, which the demonstrators proceeded to do when they switched to the chant of 'Star and Sickle, you're in a pickle'.  The Star and Tribune had a run a poll saying that John Kerry had a 9 per cent lead over George W Bush in Minnesota. Rival polls claimed the race was tied. The paper's editor had endorsed Kerry, and the Republicans believed they had uncovered a liberal plot to convince their supporters that there was no point turning out to vote.  Over in New York, moveon.org, an alliance of two million Bush loathers who, like the Minnesota Republicans, are unlikely to get through the tension of election night without a nervous collapse, paid for an attack ad in the New York Times. 'Why Does America's Top Pollster Keep Getting it Wrong?' it wanted to know. Gallup's polls, used by CNN and USA Today, had given Bush a 14 point lead but other polls conducted at the same time put it at around 3 per cent. The Kerryites noted that George Gallup Jr, son of the poll's founder and director of its research centre, was a born-again Christian of the nosiest type who had said earlier this year that 'the most profound purpose of polls is to see how people are responding to God'.  'We thought the purpose is to faithfully and factually report public opinion,' moveon.org retorted with a sniff.  You get the picture. Religious fundamentalists in the polling industry back God and Bush and do nothing to dispel the helpful illusion that the President is invincible.  The polling companies dismissed the protests as overheated allegations from an angry campaign. But the demonstrators were on to something. How can one poll give Kerry a nine point lead in Minnesota and others give him no lead at all? Why do CNN viewers hear that Bush is cruising to a landslide victory, while he's in the tightest race imaginable on other channels? Why for that matter has Labour's poll share in the past month bounced between 28 per cent and 39 per cent according to which newspaper your read? Are any of these figures true or false? And if newspapers and broadcasters can't say they're true, why do they pretend that they are facts on a par with the statement 'Yasser Arafat was admitted to hospital last week'?  The pollsters can't all be right, but they may all be wrong, and a few American journalists have the guts to admit it.  Sceptics in the media have always seen opinion polls as crooked: not as deceitful as horoscopes, but way short of the exacting standards met by the racing tipsters. Where the Minnesota Republicans and the New York liberals get it wrong is to assume the crookedness is the result of political bias. To be sure, pollsters are a part of the process which sets 'the agenda' and determines which political positions are 'appropriate' and which politicians are 'credible', but most are honest by their own lights. It's just that their lights are dimming with each passing year.  Last week the Washington Post 's pollster Richard Morin wrote a long, despairing piece whose headline 'Don't Ask Me' said it all. In Britain, the campaign polls may have underestimated Tory support in the last three elections, but the exit polls, which have far more money behind them, were reasonably close in 1997 and 2001. Morin noted that in the US, even the exit polls were a shambles.  The reason why pollsters fear their racket is 'on the way to extinction' is that the public is fed up with being pestered by hucksters. If you think about it, talking to a polling company is an odd way to behave. Strangers ask you to give them time and personal information for nothing so that they can profit from it. Once the pollsters had few competitors, now everyone's at it. In the vast United States the only way to sample the electorate is by phone.  But the polling companies aren't the only people cold calling at the precise moment when the dinner has boiled over and the baby's nappy exploded. Telemarketers infest the country. To combat them, there are call screening systems and attempts in state legislatures to make cold calling illegal. Those who can't stop the pollsters getting through are fighting back with ingenious technologies.  The Washington Post told the sad story of Rick Klaastad, a market researcher for a polling company in Oregon, who dialled an elderly man on his contact list. 'Apparently he has some electronic device attached to the phone and the next thing I hear was this loud, painful sound. It was as about as bad as it gets - imagine turning an FM stereo up full blast with a really good set of speakers. It bruised my eardrum.'  Huge numbers refuse to talk to pollsters. Morin found that 'in some surveys fewer than one in five calls produces a completed interview - raising doubts whether such polls accurately reflect the views of the public or merely report the opinions of stay-at-home Americans who are too bored, too infirm or too lonely to hang up.'  To put it at its politest, I think it's fair to say that American polls aren't want scientists call random samples.  Nor are they in Britain. Whenever the media is forced to ask whether findings that 57.2 per cent of the population don't trust Tony Blair or 12.8 per cent of twentysomething women have given up one-night stands after a three-in-a-bed romp with a two-timing love rat are true, it always quotes pollsters. What journalists neglect to mention is that the polling industry makes its real money from business, not newspapers or television. If CEOs began to suspect that the beguilingly precise findings on the existence of niche markets were false, tens of millions of pounds would be lost.  If you leave the self-interested defenders of the industry behind and turn to objective outsiders such as Roger Jowell, who runs the British Social Attitudes Survey, you find that they have been saying for years that opinion polls aren't random samples.  He explains the persistent failure to get Tory support right in campaign polls by the fact that a sizeable number of Conservatives think that time is money and don't see why they should give something for nothing. They brush past the market researcher standing in the street with a tight smile. Labour supporters and Liberal Democrats are kinder people who are more likely to help out a stranger.  Whether they will continue to do so is doubtful. Commerce is crowding into private space via junk mail, cold calls, texted adverts and the street confrontations arranged by those lovable charities. Cold calling has prejudiced Americans against telephone polling. Chugging and other forms of aggressive begging are likely to prejudice a fair chunk of the British against the poor woman in the shopping centre trying to scratch a living wage from Mori.  A lot flows from the decline of polling. First, readers who are close to tears because most US polls give Bush a slight lead can relax until election night. Only two of the 11 final national polls were right in 2000 - and there's no reason to believe that that dismal record will be bettered. (Conversely, Bush supporters - a minority among you, I suspect - shouldn't be too cocksure, defeat or a landslide is as likely as a narrow win.)  Second, all the focus-group policies the government uses to please the electorate may not only be wrong in principle but a failure in practice because the public may very well not be pleased in the least.  Finally, if the next election is as messy as a few of us suspect, with three-cornered contests taking place across the country and voters deciding whether to vote tactically against Blair or the Tories, the polls will be all important to people who want to work out what the consequences of their vote will be. They should know in advance that there's a fair chance that the polls will be tosh.","A week ago, at a reception in one of London's dowdier hotels, Maryam Namazie received a cheque and a certificate stating that she was Secularist of the Year 2005. The audience from the National Secular Society cheered, but no one else noticed.At first glance, the wider indifference wasn't surprising. Everyone is presenting everyone else with prizes these days - even journalists get them. If coverage was given to all award winners, there would be no space left in the papers for news. On top of that, secularism is still an eccentric cause. Despite the privileges of the established churches, this is one of the most irreligious countries on Earth. The bishops have power but no influence, and the notion that you need a tough-minded movement to combat religious influence still feels quaint.Like republicanism, secularism is an ideal which can enthuse the few while leaving the many cold.The rise of the Christian right in the United States and the Islamic right everywhere, of faith schools and religious censorship is breaking down complacency. The 7 July bombings should have blown it to pieces. But the Ealing comedy caricature of a kind vicar, who may be a bit silly but remains intrinsically decent, is still most people's picture of the religious in England, not least because there is truth in it. (It's a different matter in Northern Ireland and on the west coast of Scotland, for obvious reasons.)For all that, Maryam Namazie's obscurity remains baffling. She ought to be a liberal poster girl. Her life has been that of a feminist militant who fights the oppression of women wherever she finds it. She was born in Tehran, but had to flee with her family when the Iranian revolution brought the mullahs to power. After graduating in America, she went to work with the poor in the Sudan. When the Islamists seized control, she established an underground human rights network. Her cover was blown and she had to run once again. She's been a full-time campaigner for the rights of the Iranian diaspora, helping refugees across the world and banging on to anyone who will listen about the vileness of its treatment of women.When an Iranian judge hanged a 16-year-old girl for having sex outside marriage - I mean literally hanged her; he put the noose round her neck himself - Namazie organised global protests. Her best rhetorical weapon is her description of the obsessiveness of theocracy. The law in Iran not only allows women to be stoned, she says, but it specifies the size of the stones to be used; they mustn't be too small in case it takes too long to kill her and the mob gets bored; but mustn't be too big either, in case she is dispatched immediately and the mob is denied the sado-sexual pleasure of seeing her suffer.She's media-friendly and literate, not least because she runs the London-based International TV English whose programmes have a large following in the Middle East. Yet one of the most important feminists from the developing world has never been on Woman's Hour. I searched our huge cuttings database and could find only one mention of her in the national press over the past 10 years. Right-thinking, left-leaning people have backed away from Maryam Namazie because she is just as willing to tackle their tolerance of oppression as the oppressors themselves.It was the decision of broad-minded politicians in Ottawa to allow Sharia courts in Canada which did it for her. They said if they were not established, the Muslim minority would be marginalised and to say otherwise was racism pure and simple.After years of hearing this postmodern twaddle, Namazie flipped. Why was it, she asked, that supposed liberals always give 'precedence to cultural and religious norms, however reactionary, over the human being and her rights'? Why was it that they always pretended that other cultures were sealed boxes without conflicts of their own and took 'the most reactionary segment of that community' as representative of the belief and culture of the whole.In a ringing passage, which should be pinned to the noticeboards of every cultural studies faculty and Whitehall ministry, she declared that the problem with cultural relativism was that it endorsed the racism of low expectations.'It promotes tolerance and respect for so-called minority opinions and beliefs, rather than respect for human beings. Human beings are worthy of the highest respect, but not all opinions and beliefs are worthy of respect and tolerance. There are some who believe in fascism, white supremacy, the inferiority of women. Must they be respected?'Richard J Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge, pointed out in Defence of History that if you take the relativist position to its conclusion and believe there's no such thing as truth and all cultures are equally valid, you have no weapons to fight the Holocaust denier or Ku Klux Klansmen.Namazie is on the right side of the great intellectual struggle of our time between incompatible versions of liberalism. One follows the fine and necessary principle of tolerance, but ends up having to tolerate the oppression of women, say, or gays in foreign cultures while opposing misogyny and homophobia in its own. (Or 'liberalism for the liberals and cannibalism for the cannibals!' as philosopher Martin Hollis elegantly described the hypocrisy of the manoeuvre.) The alternative is to support universal human rights and believe that if the oppression of women is wrong, it is wrong everywhere.The gulf between the two is unbridgeable. Although the argument is rarely put as baldly as I made it above, you can see it breaking out everywhere across the liberal-left. Trade union leaders stormed out of the anti-war movement when they discovered its leadership had nothing to say about the trade unionists who were demanding workers' rights in Iraq and being tortured and murdered by the 'insurgents' for their presumption.Former supporters of Ken Livingstone reacted first with bewilderment and then steady contempt when he betrayed Arab liberals and embraced the Islamic religious right. The government's plans to ban the incitement of religious hatred have created an opposition which spans left and right and whose members have found they have more in common with each other than with people on 'their side'.As Namazie knows, the dispute can't stay in the background for much longer. There's an almighty smash-up coming and not before time."

Their methods are nefarious - they might ""upsell"" singles to doubles with such satanic whispers as ""why not make that a double?"" Dave Daley, head of the National Association of Licensed House Managers, muttered darkly, ""How we make our money is to make people binge drink: the more people drink, the more I get as a bonus ... The difference between us and other selling operations is that we're selling a drug."" This piece, in the Observer, was accompanied by a first-hand account of a journalist who was served, with a friend, ""64 units by the same barmaid, no questions asked"". Enough alcohol to kill; though it's worth noting that if a person was drinking those units rather than just ordering them, they would get pretty legless before they died. (My memory of being a barmaid was that you stopped serving someone once they could no longer articulate what they wanted. We weren't expected to count drinks - otherwise we wouldn't have been barmaids, we'd have been playing championship bridge.) It's true that people selling legal drugs are subject to restrictions that people selling board games aren't. Cigarette companies aren't allowed to advertise; alcohol companies have, as a gesture of goodwill, started putting ""please drink responsibly"" on billboards, which is a bit like showing a Land Rover coursing through a snowscape chasing a spy and saying ""please cycle more"" at the end. If you're flogging something actively damaging to health, you can't be too gung-ho in telling everyone what fun it is. But pubs seeking to sell more are doing what any business does: taking an existing market and trying to milk it for all it's worth. Trying to make a special exception for things that are bad for you - booze, fags, fast food - is daft. All excess consumption is, on some level - physiological, psychological, environmental, or all three - bad for everyone, except the seller. The reason we and the government try to make a special case out of health-related selling is because of the NHS, which is the ultimate victim of this aggressive marketing. Its existence is an anomaly - it functions best in the circumstances in which it was created, viz, a more frugal time when people would of course become ill but could be relied on not to try to kill themselves every weekend. It is ideologically out of step with the market principles we thank for our high living standards. If we wanted to be rational and consistent, which thank God we don't, we would can it and open up the illness game to regular forces. It's not only health we get exercised about. Similar moral objections emerge around bookselling giants, which ""cynically"" try to sell more books with dirty-tricks campaigns like putting a lot of bright pink ones in their windows and discontinuing the boring ones. Sure, this is what a shoe shop would do, but books are different because they are ""worthy"" - they have an inherent ethical weight that their manufacturers and distributors ought to respect by not behaving like manufacturers or distributors. In both instances, the revelation is the same: we aren't as comfortable with the free-market economy as we thought. We claim to have embraced, or at least accepted, it but when it comes to matters of importance, the integrity and protection of the body or mind, we return to an anachronistic model of commerce in which both sides are flush with responsibility and respect, though not with cash. So this anti-pub furore, though daft, is also endearing. We can say what we like about modernity, but we aren't as far gone as we thought."
1,"I know you should not judge by appearances, but 'Mrs B' doesn't look like a child killer. To use old-fashioned language, she is motherly - a plump, rosy-cheeked woman of Kent, whom nature seemed to have created to raise children. Kent social services soon put a stop to that. In 1999, Mrs B gave birth to a daughter. The child suffered fits that would have baffled previous generations of doctors, but which modern doctors could label with an impressively scientific name. Two concluded that Mrs B was poisoning the girl because she was an attention-seeker suffering from Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. First, they claimed she had fed her tranquillisers. There was no trace of tranquilliser in the child's blood, hair or urine. Then they claimed she had injected her with water from a flower bowl or lavatory. One of Britain's foremost toxicologists said the idea that either could have caused fits was nonsense. The family paediatrician said he found the allegations absurd. The evidence was so feeble the police didn't investigate. No matter. In 2003, the Family Division of the High Court, sitting in closed session, upheld the decision to take the girl from her mother and send her to live with relatives 200 miles away. Curiously, since the authorities had declared that Mrs B was an insane and depraved woman, the courts allowed her to keep her other two daughters. I don't know how to explain this - maybe it's a miracle - but they survive in rude health. The Family Division might have been designed to allow miscarriages of justice. Judges need only find the case against parents proven 'on the balance of probabilities' rather than 'beyond reasonable doubt'. Reasonable questioning of their decisions by outsiders is next to impossible because it is a contempt of court to reveal what has gone on. The formal reason for secrecy is that it prevents the media identifying children - and, undoubtedly, there are circumstances in which they need protecting. When there is an injustice, however, it is in the interests of parents and child for the mother to be able to exercise a free woman's right to make a fuss by going to the papers, local TV station, her councillors and MP. In normal circumstances, the law would have stymied Mrs B, but she had two strokes of luck. The first was that her solicitor was Sarah Harman. This case has come close to ruining Harman. The best part of the past 18 months has been the admiring tributes. At the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal last week, clients, judges and fellow solicitors spoke of a lawyer of the highest integrity who 'looks to right injustice wherever she finds it'. People who know her rely on her. After Michael Stone murdered Josie Russell's mother and sister, her father Shaun asked Harman to be Josie's trustee and protect her interests. If you need to smash your way through a brick wall, she is a good lawyer to have holding your coat. Mrs B was also fortunate that by 2003 politicians were belatedly realising that like many another secret world the Family Division was liable to be swept by pseudo-scientific manias. The spark for their concern was the quashing by the Court of Appeal of the convictions of Sally Clark, Angela Cannings and others allegedly driven mad by Munchausen's. The evidence of Professor Sir Roy Meadow which had sent them down for child killing was revealed to be tosh. It was not just his cockeyed testimony. The Court of Appeal wisely noticed that doctors were trying to identify illnesses that 'may be unexplained today [but] perfectly well understood tomorrow'. When medieval cartographers did not know what lay beyond the mountains they filled the blank spaces on their maps with 'There be dragons'. Much the same had happened in English law. When no one could explain injuries or illnesses, Meadow and his associates filled the blank spaces with pictures of monstrous women. Margaret Hodge, the Children's Minister, announced a review that was potentially more explosive than the Court of Appeal's verdicts. Whatever else Angela Cannings and Sally Clark had suffered, their friends and families could at least protest loudly and in public. Hodge was to look at 5,000 Family Division cases with disputed medical evidence where the courts had taken away children in secret. Well, thought Sarah Harman, if there's at last going to be a review I want my client's voice heard. She sent details of Mrs B's case to the local MP and to her sister Harriet Harman, the solicitor-general, who passed them to Hodge. Nothing they saw identified Mrs B's daughter. Mrs B also spoke to the Daily Mail and the BBC. Nothing was printed or broadcast which identified the girl. Closed systems hate daylight. Kent County Council went ape and claimed that Sarah Harman was in contempt of court for talking to politicians and the press. It was far from clear that she was. No other common law democracy imposes such restrictions on child care cases. Even in Scotland, what Sarah Harman had done would not have raised an eyebrow. Kent County Council itself discussed Mrs B with Roy Meadow, even though he was not a witness in the case. If Sarah Harman were guilty of contempt of court, so were its officers, presumably. Mr Justice Munby heard the argument. On one point all sides agreed: Sarah Harman was slow to disclose what she had done to the court. She had a good excuse. Her doctors had just told her she was suffering from cancer, and she had to endure two bouts of emergency surgery while she was fighting to defend her reputation. You might have forgiven her for being a touch confused. Munby didn't forgive and threw the book at her. She was in contempt of court and had misled the court, he declared. No one had the right to discuss a Family Division case with anyone - not with the Children's Minister or the solicitor-general or their MP. People talk about judicial activism, but this was judicial totalitarianism. Britain is a parliamentary democracy, but Munby was saying that citizens who brought their grievances to their elected representatives were in contempt of court. Harman had to pay &pound;20,000 in legal costs. The punishments didn't stop there. Last week the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal heard Kent County Council's complaint against Sarah Harman and banned her from practising law for three months. It is an ugly but typical picture of the legal establishment thumping critics when its faults are exposed. The backlash won't work and isn't working. Parliament reacted to Munby's treatment of Sarah Harman by changing the rules and giving citizens the right to discuss injustices. More reform is coming, albeit slowly and timorously. Even Mr Justice Munby told Parliament that he did not think 'the existing rules are necessary'. The old regime will die, but it is getting its pound of flesh before it goes. Sarah Harman has had her good name blackened and spent so many thousands of pounds defending herself that she has given up counting. I'm not saying all the 5,000 parents who had their children snatched were innocent. But the pathetic and frankly incredible review of their treatment found that in only one case - that's right, just one - did the Family Division get it wrong. Despite the scandal, despite the General Medical Council striking Meadow's name from the medical register, 'Mrs B' and 4,998 others are still being punished as child abusers. BBC1's adaptation of Bleak House continues at 4.10 this afternoon.","A week ago, at a reception in one of London's dowdier hotels, Maryam Namazie received a cheque and a certificate stating that she was Secularist of the Year 2005. The audience from the National Secular Society cheered, but no one else noticed.At first glance, the wider indifference wasn't surprising. Everyone is presenting everyone else with prizes these days - even journalists get them. If coverage was given to all award winners, there would be no space left in the papers for news. On top of that, secularism is still an eccentric cause. Despite the privileges of the established churches, this is one of the most irreligious countries on Earth. The bishops have power but no influence, and the notion that you need a tough-minded movement to combat religious influence still feels quaint.Like republicanism, secularism is an ideal which can enthuse the few while leaving the many cold.The rise of the Christian right in the United States and the Islamic right everywhere, of faith schools and religious censorship is breaking down complacency. The 7 July bombings should have blown it to pieces. But the Ealing comedy caricature of a kind vicar, who may be a bit silly but remains intrinsically decent, is still most people's picture of the religious in England, not least because there is truth in it. (It's a different matter in Northern Ireland and on the west coast of Scotland, for obvious reasons.)For all that, Maryam Namazie's obscurity remains baffling. She ought to be a liberal poster girl. Her life has been that of a feminist militant who fights the oppression of women wherever she finds it. She was born in Tehran, but had to flee with her family when the Iranian revolution brought the mullahs to power. After graduating in America, she went to work with the poor in the Sudan. When the Islamists seized control, she established an underground human rights network. Her cover was blown and she had to run once again. She's been a full-time campaigner for the rights of the Iranian diaspora, helping refugees across the world and banging on to anyone who will listen about the vileness of its treatment of women.When an Iranian judge hanged a 16-year-old girl for having sex outside marriage - I mean literally hanged her; he put the noose round her neck himself - Namazie organised global protests. Her best rhetorical weapon is her description of the obsessiveness of theocracy. The law in Iran not only allows women to be stoned, she says, but it specifies the size of the stones to be used; they mustn't be too small in case it takes too long to kill her and the mob gets bored; but mustn't be too big either, in case she is dispatched immediately and the mob is denied the sado-sexual pleasure of seeing her suffer.She's media-friendly and literate, not least because she runs the London-based International TV English whose programmes have a large following in the Middle East. Yet one of the most important feminists from the developing world has never been on Woman's Hour. I searched our huge cuttings database and could find only one mention of her in the national press over the past 10 years. Right-thinking, left-leaning people have backed away from Maryam Namazie because she is just as willing to tackle their tolerance of oppression as the oppressors themselves.It was the decision of broad-minded politicians in Ottawa to allow Sharia courts in Canada which did it for her. They said if they were not established, the Muslim minority would be marginalised and to say otherwise was racism pure and simple.After years of hearing this postmodern twaddle, Namazie flipped. Why was it, she asked, that supposed liberals always give 'precedence to cultural and religious norms, however reactionary, over the human being and her rights'? Why was it that they always pretended that other cultures were sealed boxes without conflicts of their own and took 'the most reactionary segment of that community' as representative of the belief and culture of the whole.In a ringing passage, which should be pinned to the noticeboards of every cultural studies faculty and Whitehall ministry, she declared that the problem with cultural relativism was that it endorsed the racism of low expectations.'It promotes tolerance and respect for so-called minority opinions and beliefs, rather than respect for human beings. Human beings are worthy of the highest respect, but not all opinions and beliefs are worthy of respect and tolerance. There are some who believe in fascism, white supremacy, the inferiority of women. Must they be respected?'Richard J Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge, pointed out in Defence of History that if you take the relativist position to its conclusion and believe there's no such thing as truth and all cultures are equally valid, you have no weapons to fight the Holocaust denier or Ku Klux Klansmen.Namazie is on the right side of the great intellectual struggle of our time between incompatible versions of liberalism. One follows the fine and necessary principle of tolerance, but ends up having to tolerate the oppression of women, say, or gays in foreign cultures while opposing misogyny and homophobia in its own. (Or 'liberalism for the liberals and cannibalism for the cannibals!' as philosopher Martin Hollis elegantly described the hypocrisy of the manoeuvre.) The alternative is to support universal human rights and believe that if the oppression of women is wrong, it is wrong everywhere.The gulf between the two is unbridgeable. Although the argument is rarely put as baldly as I made it above, you can see it breaking out everywhere across the liberal-left. Trade union leaders stormed out of the anti-war movement when they discovered its leadership had nothing to say about the trade unionists who were demanding workers' rights in Iraq and being tortured and murdered by the 'insurgents' for their presumption.Former supporters of Ken Livingstone reacted first with bewilderment and then steady contempt when he betrayed Arab liberals and embraced the Islamic religious right. The government's plans to ban the incitement of religious hatred have created an opposition which spans left and right and whose members have found they have more in common with each other than with people on 'their side'.As Namazie knows, the dispute can't stay in the background for much longer. There's an almighty smash-up coming and not before time."

Judging by the closeness of the likely electoral college figures, it may look that way. But look more carefully. Here is a big difference that really matters. In 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore than for George Bush. Yesterday, on a radically increased turnout, nearly 4 million more voted for Bush than for John Kerry.  	  Here is another difference. In 2000, Bush took Florida by only 537 votes, a margin of a mere hundredth of a percentage point. Yesterday Bush captured the sunshine state by more than 360,000 votes, a clear majority of five full points. Another decisive change.  	  And here is a third. Four years ago, it is beyond doubt that Ralph Nader, running as a third party candidate, took enough votes in Florida and elsewhere to hand the White House to Bush. Yesterday, the Nader effect faded to negligibility.  But it was a sweet night for the Republicans in other ways too. In both houses of Congress, they strengthened their narrow advantage. In the senate, where John Thune knocked off the Democratic minority leader Tom Daschle in South Dakota, Republican control is now locked in, another difference from 2000. In the House, for the sixth election in a row, the Republicans retained and strengthened their control.  	  If this doesn't add up to a mandate, it is hard to know what the word means. Increased turnout. Narrow but decisive wins on all fronts. What more can you ask for from a single campaign? Bush and his party won fair (well, probably) and square.There are no excuses this time.  We can hope that Bush takes note of the great (pro-American) English conservative Edmund Burke's dictum that ""magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom"" and governs more consensually now than before. But Bush's opponents should be wise too. Bush won. They lost. It's time for the Democrats to get back to the drawing board.  <B>"
1,"This week, barring a last-minute climb-down, Iran may get back to building a nuclear bomb. It is a small moment, and a big one. Small because the threat has lingered for years; big because the consequences could convulse the region and the world.If Iran ends its 30-month freeze on uranium tests, the long diplomatic mission by the West will be in ruins. The Foreign Office says all bets will be off; Condoleezza Rice signals that Iran is heading for the UN Security Council, and thus for resolutions and sanctions. Every diplomat and onlooker knows the steps of that quadrille. They danced it for Iraq.As Iran moves towards the ultimate in WMD, George W Bush must be thinking he fought the wrong war. Now, as Israel says Iran's nuclear missile programme 'can be destroyed', the scent of another conflict hangs in the air. Even if President Ahmadinejad steps back from the brink, as he is prone to, there is a wider threat.In the last few days, a 55-page European intelligence assessment has surfaced. This document is an audit of the quest, by rogue states, to buy the kit to make weapons of mass destruction. Syria and North Korea have been stocking up, along with Pakistan, and Iran is allegedly working towards a long-range missile that would reach Italy.In addition, New York Times reporter James Risen claims in a new book that the CIA inadvertently helped Iran build a nuclear bomb by supplying flawed blueprints that the country's scientists may have corrected and used. Obviously, leaked intelligence on WMD comes with some health warnings. How dodgy, exactly, are these dossiers?Maybe the CIA is daft enough to offer up DIY bomb manuals, though this sounds implausible. The Tesco-isation of the nuclear trade raises another caveat. According to the leaked European report, the world is a shopping mall for nukes and the boardrooms and universities of Europe are the bombers' Bond Street.Hardly any of this is top secret or new. Dubious regimes have indeed been stockpiling illicit technology, as if buying beans in Waitrose. A briefing for the Carnegie Endowment think-tank, published in September 2005, two months after the leaked report was written, lists a worldwide history of nuclear deals, including Iran's links with the rogue Pakistani scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan.Nuclear arms never held many surprises. J Robert Oppenheimer, their inventor, called himself 'the destroyer of worlds'; hopes that lavish death could forge a better universe faded faster than the prayers of the pastor who commended to God the Enola Gay, bound for Hiroshima.Sixty years on, the notion of nuclear nemesis has not sunk in. Last year's make-or-break US conference to revive the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty achieved nothing. The pact, ratified in 1970 and signed by 187 countries, was designed to ensure that unarmed states never acquired weapons and that armed nations, in return, would wind down their arsenals.That cornerstone of a peaceful world is crumbling, partly because Bush wants new weapons while demanding that other regimes forswear them, but also because the treaty is fatally flawed. Its aims, to eradicate nuclear weapons while championing the spread of nuclear energy, are irreconcilable. Atoms for Peace, suspect in Eisenhower's day, is an oxymoron in a globalised age.Any rogue state can build up a civil programme, opt out of the treaty with six months' notice and begin making weapons. Iran has always claimed, to universal disbelief, that it is only exercising its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. Pakistan, a non-signatory, was last week reported to be buying up to eight reactors from China, which has long been suspected of helping with its weapons programme.On the campuses of Tehran, even moderately minded students are aggrieved. Who are Bush and Blair to preach while laying in new nukes and welcoming India, with its illicit weapons, into their nuclear club? Israel is stacked with unauthorised nukes, a Nato base sits at Herat and the US Fifth Fleet trawls the Persian Gulf. Why should Iran, so besieged, not have a deterrent?One answer is that Ahmadinejad is a Holocaust-denier who thinks Israel should be 'wiped off the map'. No one could sleep easy with his finger trembling on a nuclear button. But there are more dangerous prospects even that the Iran bomb. Professor Paul Rogers, of Bradford University, thinks it conceivable that Israel could launch a pre-emptive attack against its loose-mouthed neighbour. Ariel Sharon's successor, needing to look tough, may be keener than his predecessor to do so.Israel would have to move fast, though. A few months from now, Iran's powerful Bushehr reactor could be up and running and few attackers would dare unleash a reprise of Chernobyl. Such a threat may seem far-fetched, but the tolerance of George W Bush for a regime he calls 'the world's primary sponsor of terror' is as thin as skin.What a year for Britain to announce a &pound;25 billion replacement for the Trident missile, plus a new generation of nuclear power stations. Tony Blair, intent on both schemes, is braced for protest on weapons but foresees little trouble over energy.Britain is not keen on taking fewer cheap flights and turning out the bathroom light. Nuclear power, touted as a painless option, is costly, risky and produces waste that stays dangerous for 240,000 years. A combination of renewables, energy saving, fossil fuels and carbon storage could provide an alternative. Besides, Britain has a duty to set some example. On nuclear power, the case is far from made.Trident, by contrast, is straightforward. Its replacement should be fought by everyone bothered about world security. More weapons for Britain would be a come-on to every failed state on the planet.In Israel, a leader lies in hospital. In Iraq, 130 people were blown up last Thursday. In North Korea, promises of nuclear disarmament have withered. In Iran, the nuclear scientists resume their work. This may be the most dangerous time since superpowers threatened mutually assured destruction.The world, once an atomic Athenaeum, has become a bomber's eBay, full of murky bidders with pseudonyms and of nukes for auction. The nuclear aristocracy is dead, destruction is democratised and Iran, angry at the West's hypocrisy on the nuclear race, believes that what's good for Totnes is good for Tehran.There is also hope. Iran's theocrats might oust Ahmadinejad. American voters may elect a President who realises, as Blair must too, that the West has to reduce its own arms if it is to persuade others to do likewise. But, for now, Cold War politics looks easy. The abyss was always safer than the quicksand. This time, we cannot simply walk","Once there was heroin chic. Its catwalk disciples had shadowed eyes, chalk faces and cadaverous cheeks. If they were high on anything, it was a cocktail of champagne, Marlboro Lights and irony. Now there is only heroin shock. The pictures of Rachel Whitear, killed at 21 with a syringe in her hand, are distressing both as an illustration of the ravages of death and for their contrasting tableau of a deeply normal life.  In the tidiest of student rooms, a girl with shiny hair and a striped dress crouches in a pose of pain or supplication. She had tried to get off drugs. Her counsellor saw her as a success story. Yet she died despite her resolve and the bright future that beckoned before she dropped out of Bath University. Her mission, ordained by her parents, is that she should now spare other children a fate from which she could not absolve herself.   Will her cautionary tale, a modern take on Belloc or Hoffman, have a lasting impact? Current wisdom says yes. Last week the British Medical Association urged the Government to revive the shock Aids campaigns of the Eighties. In their absence, sexually transmitted diseases have risen alarmingly. Complacency kills in a country where fortunes are spent to promote wrinkle creams and cars, and almost nothing on saving or enhancing lives.   But the advertising of risk is inexact. What message, exactly, should teenagers absorb? Rachel's mottled body, complete with 'Just Say No' subtext, contrasts oddly with other drug stories. On the day Prince Harry escaped a police caution for smoking dope, an inquest heard how a high-achieving, 16-year-old boy on cannabis stabbed himself through the heart with scissors in front of his father.   Real life is too complex for simple analysis of danger. That is why adult stories of addiction are so sinuous. Sir Anthony Hopkins cannot resist the suggestion that his life was once enhanced, as well as ravaged, by drink. Martin Broughton, who heads British American Tobacco, concedes that smoking is bad for you and he would counsel his children never to take it up.   Such mixed messages typify our ambivalence. Print the anti-smoking notices small on cigarette packets. Downplay the charge that alcohol abuse costs the NHS 3 billion a year. But stress the parable of Rachel Whitear, an emblem of the tragedies that befall our children. Except that she, for all the prominence of her dying, was the minority of a minority; a privileged university student who found her nemesis in lethal drugs.   Hers, in the end, is a personal, not a public lesson. Her parents longed no doubt that other children should not die needlessly. They must have yearned to give a purpose to an abbreviated life and its crushed promise.   Rachel wanted her organs to help others, but heroin abuse forbade that. Instead her parents chose to breach the privacy that death normally accords. No doubt they wished, understandably, that their child should not live and die in vain.   It is indisputable that newspapers should publish pictures offered to them. It is also right that editors should understand that such stark images may have less to say about public duty than about private despair."

Small because the threat has lingered for years; big because the consequences could convulse the region and the world.If Iran ends its 30-month freeze on uranium tests, the long diplomatic mission by the West will be in ruins. The Foreign Office says all bets will be off; Condoleezza Rice signals that Iran is heading for the UN Security Council, and thus for resolutions and sanctions. Every diplomat and onlooker knows the steps of that quadrille. They danced it for Iraq.As Iran moves towards the ultimate in WMD, George W Bush must be thinking he fought the wrong war. Now, as Israel says Iran's nuclear missile programme 'can be destroyed', the scent of another conflict hangs in the air. Even if President Ahmadinejad steps back from the brink, as he is prone to, there is a wider threat.In the last few days, a 55-page European intelligence assessment has surfaced. This document is an audit of the quest, by rogue states, to buy the kit to make weapons of mass destruction. Syria and North Korea have been stocking up, along with Pakistan, and Iran is allegedly working towards a long-range missile that would reach Italy.In addition, New York Times reporter James Risen claims in a new book that the CIA inadvertently helped Iran build a nuclear bomb by supplying flawed blueprints that the country's scientists may have corrected and used. Obviously, leaked intelligence on WMD comes with some health warnings. How dodgy, exactly, are these dossiers?Maybe the CIA is daft enough to offer up DIY bomb manuals, though this sounds implausible. The Tesco-isation of the nuclear trade raises another caveat. According to the leaked European report, the world is a shopping mall for nukes and the boardrooms and universities of Europe are the bombers' Bond Street.Hardly any of this is top secret or new. Dubious regimes have indeed been stockpiling illicit technology, as if buying beans in Waitrose. A briefing for the Carnegie Endowment think-tank, published in September 2005, two months after the leaked report was written, lists a worldwide history of nuclear deals, including Iran's links with the rogue Pakistani scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan.Nuclear arms never held many surprises. J Robert Oppenheimer, their inventor, called himself 'the destroyer of worlds'; hopes that lavish death could forge a better universe faded faster than the prayers of the pastor who commended to God the Enola Gay, bound for Hiroshima.Sixty years on, the notion of nuclear nemesis has not sunk in. Last year's make-or-break US conference to revive the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty achieved nothing. The pact, ratified in 1970 and signed by 187 countries, was designed to ensure that unarmed states never acquired weapons and that armed nations, in return, would wind down their arsenals.That cornerstone of a peaceful world is crumbling, partly because Bush wants new weapons while demanding that other regimes forswear them, but also because the treaty is fatally flawed. Its aims, to eradicate nuclear weapons while championing the spread of nuclear energy, are irreconcilable. Atoms for Peace, suspect in Eisenhower's day, is an oxymoron in a globalised age.Any rogue state can build up a civil programme, opt out of the treaty with six months' notice and begin making weapons. Iran has always claimed, to universal disbelief, that it is only exercising its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. Pakistan, a non-signatory, was last week reported to be buying up to eight reactors from China, which has long been suspected of helping with its weapons programme.On the campuses of Tehran, even moderately minded students are aggrieved. Who are Bush and Blair to preach while laying in new nukes and welcoming India, with its illicit weapons, into their nuclear club? Israel is stacked with unauthorised nukes, a Nato base sits at Herat and the US Fifth Fleet trawls the Persian Gulf. Why should Iran, so besieged, not have a deterrent?One answer is that Ahmadinejad is a Holocaust-denier who thinks Israel should be 'wiped off the map'. No one could sleep easy with his finger trembling on a nuclear button. But there are more dangerous prospects even that the Iran bomb. Professor Paul Rogers, of Bradford University, thinks it conceivable that Israel could launch a pre-emptive attack against its loose-mouthed neighbour. Ariel Sharon's successor, needing to look tough, may be keener than his predecessor to do so.Israel would have to move fast, though. A few months from now, Iran's powerful Bushehr reactor could be up and running and few attackers would dare unleash a reprise of Chernobyl. Such a threat may seem far-fetched, but the tolerance of George W Bush for a regime he calls 'the world's primary sponsor of terror' is as thin as skin.What a year for Britain to announce a &pound;25 billion replacement for the Trident missile, plus a new generation of nuclear power stations. Tony Blair, intent on both schemes, is braced for protest on weapons but foresees little trouble over energy.Britain is not keen on taking fewer cheap flights and turning out the bathroom light. Nuclear power, touted as a painless option, is costly, risky and produces waste that stays dangerous for 240,000 years. A combination of renewables, energy saving, fossil fuels and carbon storage could provide an alternative. Besides, Britain has a duty to set some example. On nuclear power, the case is far from made.Trident, by contrast, is straightforward. Its replacement should be fought by everyone bothered about world security. More weapons for Britain would be a come-on to every failed state on the planet.In Israel, a leader lies in hospital. In Iraq, 130 people were blown up last Thursday. In North Korea, promises of nuclear disarmament have withered. In Iran, the nuclear scientists resume their work. This may be the most dangerous time since superpowers threatened mutually assured destruction.The world, once an atomic Athenaeum, has become a bomber's eBay, full of murky bidders with pseudonyms and of nukes for auction. The nuclear aristocracy is dead, destruction is democratised and Iran, angry at the West's hypocrisy on the nuclear race, believes that what's good for Totnes is good for Tehran.There is also hope. Iran's theocrats might oust Ahmadinejad. American voters may elect a President who realises, as Blair must too, that the West has to reduce its own arms if it is to persuade others to do likewise. But, for now, Cold War politics looks easy. The abyss was always safer than the quicksand. This time, we cannot simply walk","I first encountered the phenomenon of Victim's Licence when arguing on a radio show with a British importer of mahogany from the Amazon. I had pointed out that the timber cutters who supplied him were hiring gunmen to shoot indigenous people. ""Well,"" he replied, ""life is cheap in Brazil."" I told him that was a shocking thing to say. ""Don't you lecture me about human rights,"" he snapped. ""My parents were killed in the Holocaust."" And, of course, he put me on the back foot. I mumbled something to the effect that he of all people should know the consequences of waiving the value of human life. But despite his evident hypocrisy, he had acquired moral authority: he had suffered horribly as a result of mass murder; I had not.  It's partly for this reason that we overlook the atrocious crimes committed by the government of Rwanda. Over the past fortnight, as we commemorated the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the Kagame government's foreign policy was all but ignored. The good guys were murdered by the bad guys; the good guys fought back, drove the bad guys out, formed a new government, and peace came to a troubled land. This is the story our fairytale view of history demands: the victims remain victims, the aggressors remain aggressors. They are permitted to change places only when, like the Afghan mojahedin, they find themselves on the wrong side of the geopolitical fence. Until then, the crimes the victims might commit are licensed by compassion and embarrassment.  After the genocide in Rwanda, many of the perpetrators - assisted, disgracefully, by French soldiers - fled to what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Paul Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) chased them over the border, helped Congolese rebels to capture much of the east of the country, and, in 1997, overthrew President Mobutu. Hunting down the genocidaires and deposing the president who sheltered them could both be judged legitimate means of securing peace in Rwanda, but Paul Kagame's army also had other interests.  The misfortune of the Congolese is that they possess tremendous natural wealth. This means, as it has meant in all such places, that they are perpetually exposed to theft, expulsion, slavery and murder. We know all about the crimes of men like King Leopold II of Belgium and President Mobutu. We are less ready to notice the crimes of Paul Kagame.  Six foreign armies have been involved in the theft of the DRC's resources over the past 10 years, but Rwanda's was singled out by the UN's report on the catastrophe there for the ""institutional"" nature of its piracy. The plunder was not caused by an ill-disciplined army running out of control. It was a deliberate policy, commissioned and implemented by the Rwandan government.   By 1999, the ""Congo Desk"" of the Rwandan army was generating 80% of the Rwandan military budget - some $320m. This is the equivalent of 20% of Rwanda's gross national product. The money came principally from two sources: diamonds and coltan. Coltan is the ore from which tantalum, the expensive metal used in mobile phones, is extracted, and almost all of it comes from the DRC.  Sixty to 70% of the coltan exported from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the United Nations reported in 2002, has been mined ""under the direct surveillance"" of the Rwandan army. Most of the rest was produced by subcontractors and companies answerable to the army or to other departments of the Rwandan government. Kagame's people, in other words, had a near-monopoly on global coltan production.  After fighting off the Ugandan army in June 2000, the Rwandan forces managed ""to funnel all the diamonds in Kisangani [in eastern DRC] through the Congo Desk"". Local diamond traders were forced to sell to the contractor nominated by the Rwandan army, and at prices set by the desk. The Rwandans appear to have been stealing about $2m worth of diamonds a month. The army also captured almost all the eastern Congo's public funds, taxing the people and seizing the revenues from water, electricity, roads and airports.  The RPF's original excuse for intervention disappeared pretty rapidly - in fact it soon linked up with the Hutu killers it was supposed to be hunting, and used them to help control the region. Instead, according to the UN: ""With minor exceptions, the objective of [its] military activity is to secure access to mining sites or ensure a supply of captive labour."" On the shores of Lake Tanganyika, according to a report by the Catholic church, Rwandan soldiers tortured, raped and murdered local people.  Ten days ago, Alison des Forges wrote for the Guardian that: ""There is no equivalence, of course, in the kind of crimes charged to the RPF and the crime of genocide."" It's true that the Rwandan army never sought to exterminate the people of the eastern Congo. It is also true that its displacement of local people, who fled as it burned their villages and seized their resources, caused more deaths than the Interahamwe. The militias murdered around 800,000. In the DRC, the UN suggests, more than 3.5 million deaths in excess of previous levels of mortality ""occurred from the beginning of the war up to September 2002. These deaths are a direct result of the occupation by Rwanda and Uganda"".  Kagame formally withdrew his troops from the DRC in 2002, but before doing so he made sure that its wealth continued to flow into Rwanda. He replaced the Congolese bosses of public utilities with his own people,  put the soldiers running the coltan mines in civilian clothes and inserted his troops into local forces. The prosperity which has helped to secure peace in Rwanda derives in large part from the plunder which has helped to sustain war in the DRC.  So last week we saw one of the world's bloodiest war criminals standing in the national stadium in Kigali, holding a red rose and announcing that ""We cannot turn the clock back ... but we have the power to determine the future and to ensure that what happened never happens again."" No one complained. No one pointed out that, thanks to his army, it has already happened, again and again. By preserving the fairytale, we license the victim to keep committing the crime.  It is arguable that nothing so endangers world peace and human rights as official victimhood. Hitler played upon the German people's grievances about the reparations exacted from them after the first world war. The allies overlooked the expulsion of 3 million Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after the second world war. The Israeli government insists that anyone who criticises its human rights record is ""anti-semitic"", a participant, in other words, in the oppression of the Jews. George Bush claims that America has a right to take its war on terror wherever he pleases, as a result of the atrocity it suffered in 2001. We must never forget the appalling crimes from which they draw their licence. But if we really wish to ensure that it ""never happens again"", we must judge people by what they do rather than by who they are.  www.monbiot.com"
1,"The living are always more shocking than the dead. A seven-year-old Swedish boy tramps the streets of Phuket, searching for his parents and two brothers. A mother from the Andaman Islands weeps as she feeds her baby. The poster children of disaster and the pietas of grief are the images that cling, rather than the bodies washed ashore in a soup of debris. As the new year begins, the story of the tsunami is being shaped into a simple parable. Nature is vicious and people are kind; 150,000 corpses and 50 million in British donations alone stack up to prove a message that turns global wisdom on its head. In 2004, manmade disaster prised nations and religions apart, as dead children, from Beslan to Baghdad, supplied proof of human viciousness. Then, in a codicil to a year of terror, the planet showed that it could do apocalypse and primal fear better than any mortal agent.  So goodbye cosmic solitude, banished in a tragedy that united rich tourists with the 'sea gypsies' of poor Muslim communities, eking out such a threadbare existence on the shoreline of paradise that the tidal wave bore no economic sting to the countries it devastated. The tsunami's damage to India, for example, is likely to amount to only 0.07 per cent of its gross domestic product.  Anguish is not often universal. Susan Sontag, the American writer who died of leukaemia last week, argued that victims guarded their sorrows jealously. 'It is intolerable to have one's own sufferings twinned with anyone else's,' she wrote. Not any more, as newspaper elegists focus on victims from Surrey to Sumatra and the world huddles round its shared catastrophe.  The vast sums collected reflect, beyond altruism, a hope that the wildness of nature and the folly of men can be bought off in corporate donations and pensioners' heating allowances. Individuals' generosity, though praiseworthy and humbling, suggests something more complicated than kindness.  Hideous and dramatic scenes instil to help, but they also catalyse an adrenaline of mourning. That mood does not necessarily promise a better tomorrow. The solidarity following 9/11 fractured into revenge that ushered in a more perilous world and bystanders inured to the pain of others. In contrast to the audit of tragedy after the tsunami, no government bothered to count the bodies of Iraqi civilians.  Collective emotion is always fickle and sometimes tainted. In one of the last great outbreaks of group grieving, cellophane-wrapped bouquets piled up for Princess Diana, and the media clamoured for leadership. Just as the Queen was bidden back from Balmoral, so Tony Blair was urged to get off his Egyptian deckchair and fly home. The mawkish wake for Diana is not to be compared with the heartfelt response of people who could understand, in the tsunami victims' agony, how it must feel to watch a partner drown, to cry in vain for a lost child or to lament the disappeared.  But both real and synthetic grief slide easily into blame. Scapegoats of the tsunami range from organised religion to shambolic aid providers to moneyed Westerners with an unhealthy yen for beachside primitivism. For blamers and the givers to draw what sense and solace they can from horror is not a disreputable response.  It is not an endorsement of William Hazlitt's view that love of cruelty is as natural as sympathy to human beings, let alone of Edmund Burke's belief that we have 'a degree of delight' in the pain of strangers. Modern citizens, sated by images of death, do not need a tsunami to teach them how randomly the bell tolls.  But disaster also offers a strange comfort. The solidarity of giving assuages the guilt and fractiousness of societies normally force-fed on fear and mistrust. It also lulls people into using the unthinkable as an affirmation of their own worldviews, rather than the challenge it should be.  Secularists deride the platitudes of churchmen and ask how the religious can believe in a god who sanctions such atrocities. The devout criticise the nihilism of rationalists and describe their own faith as a candle in the darkness. Creationists, who still think that 'the fountains of the great deep' in Genesis 7.11 signified the tsunami that launched Noah and his floating zoo, presumably consider the latest earthquake another instalment in the Almighty's great partwork.  Those who consider global warming an overrated fuss see the earthquake as proof that outlawing aerosols and recycling the new year champagne bottles are pointless gestures. More plausibly, people who warn that the world is on a reckless path to self-destruction decipher in the earthquake an urgent warning of what is happening to a planet cursed by hurricanes, typhoons and rising seas.  The tsunami has confirmed, and never confounded, the views of its spectators. An earthquake may tilt the world on its axis, but it cannot shake the human mind. President Bush, whose initial pledge of $15m was half the cost of his inauguration, will still not sign up to Kyoto. Mr Blair writes boldly in the Economist of 'aiming high' on climate change during the presidency of the G8, but many worry that his market-based approach to climate change and lack of curbs on lavish energy consumers smack of pitching his efforts far too low.  Ordinary citizens, even the most generous, need to notice the 30,000 children under five who die each day, irrespective of whether their corpses lie alongside those of Western babies. The godless, like me, should never presume to see catastrophe as a snub to people of faith, just as all believers should acknowledge that their god is supremely short of answers when worlds cave in and children rot to death in hospital corridors.  The donations will be counted, the aid will kick in and the monolith of the UN will creak into action, for a time. New earthquake monitors will ensure that no crab can scuttle across the floor of the Indian Ocean without activating a sensor in Jakarta or Bangkok.  But nothing will really change unless the spirit of global co-operation is real. That means confronting the overlapping problems of climate change, humanitarian crises and war. It means never again embarking so recklessly on the sort of manufactured catastrophe still unrolling in Iraq. It means realising that a volatile planet and uniquely powerful warmongers form a mix no species can reliably withstand.  The tsunami offers many lessons, but one is the selectivity of pity. A Swedish boy searches for his parents. A mother from a vanishing tribe gazes across her infant's body through a wall of tears, and the world responds to both. But the test of compassion is what happens next to millions of people made hungry and poor by acts of nature and global policy alike.  In the optimistic view, people have signalled a universal empathy not just with last week's survivors but with the legions of shadowy victims marginalised, demonised or massacred at the whim of the mighty. Citizens have distilled the essence of reform. It is up to politicians to bottle and sell it.","Dead children always look so beautiful. Victoria Climbi's curls are held with yellow ties, and her smile is hopeful. Lauren Wright has blonde bunches caught in rosebud ribbons. The girls' school photos, shot in a rare instant of peace or pretence, bear no relationship to the reality of their lives. One child was left in a sack of excrement in a cold bath; the other was pulverised like steak on a butcher's slab and left to die. In the face of such incomprehensible brutality, the pictures tell a simpler horror story. A murderous great-aunt adjusted the yellow hair ties. A killer stepmother fixed the rosebud ribbons. The clash of normality and evil appals and also, in some curious way, absolves us. We are detached and at a loss to comprehend.  Such wickedness, we think, does not brush ordinary lives. It does now. The Climbi inquiry is a recital of blight and official blindness in the anonymous inner city. The case of Lauren Wright demonstrates how a peaceful Norfolk village, with a church, an ivy-clad pub and 300 inhabitants, can double as a torture chamber. Neighbours and teachers looked on as Lauren's weight fell and her bruises spread. Tracey Wright, a playground helper, felt sufficiently emboldened by communitarian spirit to brutalise her in public and encourage her own children to spit in their stepsister's face.   What sort of a woman commits such atrocities? Cruel, sadistic, not clever but very cunning. And familiar. The monstrous mother has existed since the time of Euripides and before. While Tracey Wright may not qualify as a modern   Medea, she is a recognisable figure in the canon of evil. Nor is there anything new in the modern continuum of child torture. Every week in Britain, at least one child dies at the hands of a parent or carer. As the NSPCC points out, the roll call of child killing has continued uninterrupted since Maria Colwell was murdered in the early 70s. For all the reforms and promises, we have made no impact at all.   But the culture that spawns viciousness evolves in terrifying ways. It seems unbelievable that those who watched Lauren suffer could shuffle their feet, like awkward spectators at a stranger's deathbed, as a child was inched towards her grave. It is unspeakable, too, that social services should lace their culpability with such cynicism. The official valediction to brief lives now contains two strands. First, supply extra money, or expect more deaths. The second message, whispered as the Climbi inquiry continues, is that professionals should not have their errors paraded, lest potential care workers shun this blighted system.   Such arguments brand at-risk children as economic bait. It is, however, true that the Government is so miserly on child protection that English authorities have overspent by 500 million this year, just to provide the thin back-up that allowed Lauren and Victoria's killings. Diverting money into favoured, and successful, Government initiatives, such as Sure Start, means less for basic services. Promises to eradicate child poverty, linked closely to neglect, sound hopeful, but 4.3 million British children remain poor. The Prime Minister lauds America, where the impoverished black child may aspire to high office. We shall see soon how the Colin Powell model will play out here.   Poverty is not the only issue. Nor is a pernicious minority of brutes who torture children the sole problem, though it is the least tractable. Michael Stone, the murderer of Lin and Megan Russell and a man no doubt immortalised some where in a sweet-faced school snapshot, was beaten by his stepfather at the age of one and abused by social workers. We understand how to create monsters. We do not know how to redeem them. Notions of parenting classes for the inadequate are little more than a sop for middle class do-gooders with the warm idea that cruelty is amenable to the intervention of a Dr Spockish government.   But the state is a dreadful parent. It is responsible for care home scandals. It presides,  in loco parentis, over the young offenders' institutions that, for all the warnings, still corrupt and kill. We weep, rightly, for murdered toddlers, but children discovered hanging in a Feltham cell die without public lament or remark. What binds such victims to each other, and to all those whose lives will never be corroded by cruelty, is absence of power.   Adults see children as their property. The law is cavalier. A child can be arrested and strip-searched at 10 but not interviewed by police until he or she is 14. Children can drink alcohol at five but not buy a pet kitten before the age of 12. It took until last year for the Home Office to issue guidance that child prostitutes were abuse victims, not criminals. A few weeks ago Scotland announced its plan to outlaw smacking for the under-threes. Westminster proposals are imminent, and child protection charities fear that a government that recently sanctioned smacking by childminders might restrict the ban to babies only.   Outlawing smacking altogether is imperative. Those who hesitated to report Tracey Wright as she went about the legalised business of battering her child might have thought again. Such a ban would also impact on parents, Blair and   Blunkett included, who see no great harm in a remedial swipe. It would symbolise a fairer world for children and end the idea that Article 12 of the Human Rights Convention is, like recorder lessons and broccoli, desirable but inessential.   A lack of rights for children drives society's failings. That absence feeds the confidence of torturers, the apathy of protectors and the vagueness of government reformers. It underpins the cruel practice of keeping children with their birth parents when all reason and humanity demands their removal. It genuflects to the madness of a system in which it is legal to assault a child but not a grown-up. It makes adults, the monstrous and the kind alike, complicit in neglect.   So, reform the child care system. Have a Children's Commissioner, as the NSPCC and others demand. But a slicker, more accountable structure will not be enough. We have the worst child poverty and infant mortality rates in Europe. A quarter of recorded rape victims are children. One in five children is mentally ill. Another child will be killed by a parent before this week is over. The charge sheet, if there ever is one, is likely to say manslaughter, not murder. The presumption is that the premeditated slaughter of a child is a lesser crime. What are the remedies against such horrors?   'We deserve to know why,' Lauren's MP said, as she demanded an inquiry into her death. But we do know why. And the lesson, not yet absorbed, of Victoria's and Lauren's deaths is that children, not adults, are the deserving ones. They need more rights, more legal protection, more compassion. They need more than old stereotypes of evil and of innocence. They need solutions to disaster that go beyond a tired litany of official regret laced with laments on overwork. They deserve better than a society that turns its back on the ugly fate of living children while weeping at the beauty of the dead."

Plenty of them have much to fear in their own constituencies in this low season for Labour.Those who did spend a freezing wet weekend in Blackpool found the spring conference pretty dismal and dispiriting. It was planned as a rip-roaring celebration of Labour's glorious centenary, but few people came; there were few MPs, a smattering of ministers drafted in, and the press room was bare. Many constituency parties sent no delegates.The frail state of the grassroots was whispered often in the Winter Gardens. Hazel Blears and John Prescott, trying to bounce the party into a semblance of life with defibrillator jolts of demented optimism, rashly opined that parties which wither at the roots will die at the top. With most big cities lost and a massacre of remaining councils expected at the May elections, some constituency parties that have recently lost their MP, their council and most councillors are struggling to sustain the will to live. Now add in the Dunfermline result and it's not surprising that so few went to Blackpool. As the leadership interregnum drags on, it saps the blood of the party.Tony Blair turned in a below-par speech. But even belowpar and fading in power to convince, every time he steps up to a lectern he reminds them all of his political genius. It is the same in the Commons: he stands amid swelling backbench rebellion, yet on Wednesday mornings he can rouse his party to whooping glee as he lands punches on the bench opposite, reminding his own that they may miss him when he's gone. With all that vim and verve, no wonder he can't let go. So much still to do, so much to stop his successor doing.It is human instinct to clutch after immortality, leaving a footstep in the shifting sand. But political leaders crave it with unnatural passion. Blair is trying to force his legacy on to his successor, fixing Gordon Brown's feet in concrete into his own footsteps. The so-called ""dual prime minister"" scenario described by Charles Clarke looks more like the grizzly embrace of death, the dying man holding the future leader in a deadly grip with his last gasp.In this terminal phase, Brown has no option but to obey. So out he goes to bat for the ID cards he used to think wildly too expensive. In his speech yesterday on security, he even made a reasonable stab at pretending a pressing need for the ""glorification of terrorism"" clause, which virtually no one in the Commons believes. His speeches are taking a Churchillian turn as he reprises his Britishness theme, calling for ceremonies in every constituency for Veterans' Day and new cadet schemes to instil military discipline in state-school pupils. ""We will not yield, relax, rest, become complacent or lower our guard but will use every means, every necessary resource..."" and more, to fight terror.The daily taunts from the Tories (and some Blairites) that Brown will abandon ""reform"" to lead Labour back to its dark days of producer interests and union power seem to be hitting their mark. In response, no flag is big enough, no trumpet loud enough, no dead hero's memorial tall enough - Brown must add to their patriotic clamour.It may not gladden the hearts of those hoping that his premiership will herald renewal, optimism and progressive enthusiasm. Every time Brown parrots the need for ""reform, reform, reform"" as defined by Blair, spirits in the party sink a bit lower. But he has no choice. He is destined to follow Blair's footsteps every inch of the way - until the old leader finally departs and discovers that no prime minister can ever command the future beyond his time.All this tells us very little of what to expect when Brown's day finally comes. Expect no more than a tiny flash of the cardinal's red lining in what he says now. Whether once in power he will ever give more than the odd tantalising glimpse, it's hard to know. But for now he has no choice but tough talking. The success of New Labour was built on the ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"" slogan that Brown himself devised. Unless Labour can prove itself as patriotic, as ready to fight and as ready to punish wrongdoers as the Tories, it will lose, lose and lose again. True, Blair has taken this game into extreme overkill, fighting more wars and locking up more criminals than any other government. But no Labour leader can survive if they fail the ""toughness"" test.With Brown, more lies beneath the rhetoric. Everyone is for ""reform"": he hints that his might be of a different hue. Tucked into yesterday's tough speech on security was a balancing thoughtfulness on stronger democratic accountability and shoring up civil liberties, and a seriousness about rights, with radical constitutional proposals to come. There are layers of ideas wrapped inside his flag as he strives to reclaim patriotism and Britishness for the progressive cause. It sounds so counterintuitive and unconvincing to many Labour ears that it may be a hopeless task - but it does make him unassailable by the Tories. He promises more optimistic themes in speeches to follow - easing the hardship of the lives of those ""hardworking"" families so often extolled by politicians, with more to come on social justice, children and opportunity.But he can say little while cemented into the Blair footprints. Hints and briefings are not much to go on, leaving his party clutching at straws: some will point despairingly at Brown's ultra-caution, secretiveness and failure to castigate boardroom greed. The economic dysfunction caused by gross income inequality never draws a murmur of disapproval. Some doubters worry it will be more of the same, but without Blair's magic appeal to the middle classes.Just wait until he gets his freedom, say his supporters. There will be a cornucopia of surprises, an opening up of government in a style to confound his critics. Purpose, drive and dynamism will bring the renewal this party needs.Whichever it is to be, even those wary of Brown now join his enthusiasts in just wanting to get the waiting over. At Blackpool I stopped 15 local delegates in a row, including some Labour party stewards. That's hardly a significant sample, but every single one said unequivocally that Blair should go by the summer and let the party start again at the autumn conference. Until he goes this will remain a fractious party in a state of suspended animation."
1,"When ticking off the media for their 'corrosive' cynicism, Prince Charles likes to quote the last lines of  Middlemarch. His fondness for this hymn to unsung heroes must mean he thinks George Eliot an ally in bolstering respect for the monarchy. Perhaps the prince does not know that she was much more subversive than the torpid hordes now declining to make jellies for the jubilee. During a flirtation with republicanism, Eliot referred to Victoria, her contemporary and sometime fan, as 'our little humbug of a queen'. Which just shows that you are never safe from cynics. Charles Clarke thinks elements of the press are 'actually about promotion of cynicism'. Tony Blair, on his recent visit to Africa, lambasted 'the cynics back home'. Greg 'cut the crap' Dyke offers yellow cards to can't-do sceptics on his staff, and Gavyn Davies berates 'white, middle-class, middle-aged' whingers complaining about dumbing down the BBC. Alas, Mr Davies's tirade has only invoked a further flurry of cynicism from those who fear that, if Rolf Harris is the jewel of arts programming, it cannot be long before nu-metal band Slipknot is kicking Saint-Sans off Radio 3.  We are losing faith in old institutions, and they are losing faith in us. Early next month, the political philosopher Onora O'Neill will address the first of her BBC Reith lectures to the collapse of trust between the British people and the Civil Service, the medical profession, politicians, church and business. It is not certain what Lord Reith might have thought of Mr Dyke's 'Operation Top   Dog' fact-finding trip to the United States, complete with a stay in a hotel reportedly favoured by Mick Jagger. Nor is it known what Baroness O'Neill, a latter-day Kantian and Lords cross-bencher, will make of her subject matter. I hope she calls it for the cynics.  Cynicism is the fuel of public life. When political ideology and money get sparse, it is a prime deliverer of standards and probity. Blind trust in business is, post-Enron, only for the gullible and shredder salesmen. Unquestioning belief in doctors led to abysmal regulation and arrogance. Those are replaced now, thanks to cynicism, with greater transparency, convictions for the Dewhurst branch of gynaecology, plus the hope that babies are no longer likely to be killed at Bristol or bottled at Alder Hey.  But for cynicism, we might marvel at the altruism of Edward and Sophie, believe that Signor Berlusconi is the new prophet of workplace fairness and trust that women who use the right brand of shampoo can rely on mermaid hair. No wonder politicians search for the elixir of squandered faith.  Too late. Cynicism is the new politics, and how useful it can be to Ministers professing to abhor it. In an age of innocence, Mr Blair's endorsement of creationist teaching at Emmanuel School in Gateshead would be truly worrying. Now it matters less that children, as neo-Darwinians such as Richard Dawkins rightly protest, are being fed 'ludicrous falsehoods'.  The failsafe is that children, even sheltered ones, are cynical rationalists. The debate between evolution and creation was settled, for good and in the former's favour, in the 1860 Oxford debate between between T.H. Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce. Any teacher now hopeful of persuading streetwise Limp Bizkit fans that God created the world quicker than Glenys Kinnock can rustle up a Fray Bentos supper is likely also to believe in Santa Claus.  But politicians think scepticism a sin to be excised. There is something sly, cynical even, in their attempts to re-engage an electorate of whom fewer than 60 per cent voted in the last election. (Even this figure is less worrying in the context of Robert Mugabe's 112 per cent turn-out in some polling stations, but that is by the way.) Moves towards e-democracy and away from in-your-face campaigning are about machinery, not message. Nor do Ministers acknowledge their own double standard. Apathy, the hated twin of cynicism, is the Ritalin of the masses and thus the drug of political dreams.  If people were as apathetic as politicians complain, there would have been no fuel protests, no anti-globalisation marches, no MMR furore, no Garbagegate. While not all of these are desirable, they demonstrate plenty of engagement in politics. It's just all the wrong sort, supposedly practised by selfish, embittered carpers encouraged to stick the boot into the corpse of deference by a cynical media in thrall to New Cynicism.  Old cynicism looked different. The founder of the Cynic sect, Antisthenes, was a fifth-century BC philosopher so avid for moral wisdom that he travelled every day from Piraeus to Athens (tricky by public transport, even in pre-Byers times) to hear Socrates speak. His disciples' code of strict religious observance, ragged cloaks and revolt against decadence seems, give or take Mittalgate, pink pinstripes by Sir Paul Smith and a BlairForce One jet (cancelled), more in tune with the pious ways of political leaders than with the electorate. Who are the real cynics now?  It's hard to judge, when each side thinks the other so corrupted. The certainty is that politicians have not grasped that the British electorate, while abhorring mendacity and sleaze, prefers cynicism to zealotry in its leaders. Morality drives Tony Blair to support currently indefensible action against Iraq. George Bush, a President of unimpeachable godliness, maintains his   axis of good by tearing up weapons treaties and sending a mentally-ill mother who killed her children to jail for 40 years. If this is virtue, one can only wonder what terrors Saddam's evil entails.  We will have to keep on guessing. The dossier that appalled Mr Bush and Mr Blair is locked in Dick Cheney's briefcase, to be fluttered in front of Middle Eastern leaders who seemed suspiciously unscandalised by the Vice-President's proof. In less doubting times, any government move towards military action against Iraq would be deemed as scrupulously tested as a Which? best-buy toasted-sandwich maker. Instead, there is scant enthusiasm. So thank heavens for cynicism, the province of satirists from Molire to Wilde and the last long-stop of democracy. We are going to need it.  That doesn't mean that Mr Blair fails wholly to understand public disillusion. In his convincing speech at the LSE, the Prime Minister ditched the messianic, rabbit-out-of-the-hat salvationism pitched somewhere between Martin Luther King and Paul Daniels. His gospel of public service delivery won't enthuse potential voters, any more than Barcelona smallprint will captivate those stuck on a commuter train at Luton Parkway. But as a move towards the more sober dialogue the Government wants, calm objectives beat both hot rhetoric and the anti-media witchhunts so popular with Ministers and royalty.  As Charles should consider next time he dusts off his  Middlemarch, such tactics offer an uncomfortable echo of Jonathan Aitken's promise to beat 'bent and twisted journalism' with his 'simple sword of truth'. Establishment moaners will have to find a better remedy against public scornfulness. It would be helpful to Mr Blair if young people were inspired by activism, but grassroots politics, like Passing Cloud cigarettes and jitterbugging, is a redundant craving. Enthusing voters will become easy only when government rebrands cynicism as the manna it professes to crave; the holy grail of reasoned opposition.","Dead children always look so beautiful. Victoria Climbi's curls are held with yellow ties, and her smile is hopeful. Lauren Wright has blonde bunches caught in rosebud ribbons. The girls' school photos, shot in a rare instant of peace or pretence, bear no relationship to the reality of their lives. One child was left in a sack of excrement in a cold bath; the other was pulverised like steak on a butcher's slab and left to die. In the face of such incomprehensible brutality, the pictures tell a simpler horror story. A murderous great-aunt adjusted the yellow hair ties. A killer stepmother fixed the rosebud ribbons. The clash of normality and evil appals and also, in some curious way, absolves us. We are detached and at a loss to comprehend.  Such wickedness, we think, does not brush ordinary lives. It does now. The Climbi inquiry is a recital of blight and official blindness in the anonymous inner city. The case of Lauren Wright demonstrates how a peaceful Norfolk village, with a church, an ivy-clad pub and 300 inhabitants, can double as a torture chamber. Neighbours and teachers looked on as Lauren's weight fell and her bruises spread. Tracey Wright, a playground helper, felt sufficiently emboldened by communitarian spirit to brutalise her in public and encourage her own children to spit in their stepsister's face.   What sort of a woman commits such atrocities? Cruel, sadistic, not clever but very cunning. And familiar. The monstrous mother has existed since the time of Euripides and before. While Tracey Wright may not qualify as a modern   Medea, she is a recognisable figure in the canon of evil. Nor is there anything new in the modern continuum of child torture. Every week in Britain, at least one child dies at the hands of a parent or carer. As the NSPCC points out, the roll call of child killing has continued uninterrupted since Maria Colwell was murdered in the early 70s. For all the reforms and promises, we have made no impact at all.   But the culture that spawns viciousness evolves in terrifying ways. It seems unbelievable that those who watched Lauren suffer could shuffle their feet, like awkward spectators at a stranger's deathbed, as a child was inched towards her grave. It is unspeakable, too, that social services should lace their culpability with such cynicism. The official valediction to brief lives now contains two strands. First, supply extra money, or expect more deaths. The second message, whispered as the Climbi inquiry continues, is that professionals should not have their errors paraded, lest potential care workers shun this blighted system.   Such arguments brand at-risk children as economic bait. It is, however, true that the Government is so miserly on child protection that English authorities have overspent by 500 million this year, just to provide the thin back-up that allowed Lauren and Victoria's killings. Diverting money into favoured, and successful, Government initiatives, such as Sure Start, means less for basic services. Promises to eradicate child poverty, linked closely to neglect, sound hopeful, but 4.3 million British children remain poor. The Prime Minister lauds America, where the impoverished black child may aspire to high office. We shall see soon how the Colin Powell model will play out here.   Poverty is not the only issue. Nor is a pernicious minority of brutes who torture children the sole problem, though it is the least tractable. Michael Stone, the murderer of Lin and Megan Russell and a man no doubt immortalised some where in a sweet-faced school snapshot, was beaten by his stepfather at the age of one and abused by social workers. We understand how to create monsters. We do not know how to redeem them. Notions of parenting classes for the inadequate are little more than a sop for middle class do-gooders with the warm idea that cruelty is amenable to the intervention of a Dr Spockish government.   But the state is a dreadful parent. It is responsible for care home scandals. It presides,  in loco parentis, over the young offenders' institutions that, for all the warnings, still corrupt and kill. We weep, rightly, for murdered toddlers, but children discovered hanging in a Feltham cell die without public lament or remark. What binds such victims to each other, and to all those whose lives will never be corroded by cruelty, is absence of power.   Adults see children as their property. The law is cavalier. A child can be arrested and strip-searched at 10 but not interviewed by police until he or she is 14. Children can drink alcohol at five but not buy a pet kitten before the age of 12. It took until last year for the Home Office to issue guidance that child prostitutes were abuse victims, not criminals. A few weeks ago Scotland announced its plan to outlaw smacking for the under-threes. Westminster proposals are imminent, and child protection charities fear that a government that recently sanctioned smacking by childminders might restrict the ban to babies only.   Outlawing smacking altogether is imperative. Those who hesitated to report Tracey Wright as she went about the legalised business of battering her child might have thought again. Such a ban would also impact on parents, Blair and   Blunkett included, who see no great harm in a remedial swipe. It would symbolise a fairer world for children and end the idea that Article 12 of the Human Rights Convention is, like recorder lessons and broccoli, desirable but inessential.   A lack of rights for children drives society's failings. That absence feeds the confidence of torturers, the apathy of protectors and the vagueness of government reformers. It underpins the cruel practice of keeping children with their birth parents when all reason and humanity demands their removal. It genuflects to the madness of a system in which it is legal to assault a child but not a grown-up. It makes adults, the monstrous and the kind alike, complicit in neglect.   So, reform the child care system. Have a Children's Commissioner, as the NSPCC and others demand. But a slicker, more accountable structure will not be enough. We have the worst child poverty and infant mortality rates in Europe. A quarter of recorded rape victims are children. One in five children is mentally ill. Another child will be killed by a parent before this week is over. The charge sheet, if there ever is one, is likely to say manslaughter, not murder. The presumption is that the premeditated slaughter of a child is a lesser crime. What are the remedies against such horrors?   'We deserve to know why,' Lauren's MP said, as she demanded an inquiry into her death. But we do know why. And the lesson, not yet absorbed, of Victoria's and Lauren's deaths is that children, not adults, are the deserving ones. They need more rights, more legal protection, more compassion. They need more than old stereotypes of evil and of innocence. They need solutions to disaster that go beyond a tired litany of official regret laced with laments on overwork. They deserve better than a society that turns its back on the ugly fate of living children while weeping at the beauty of the dead."

Your duty is to work tirelessly to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And to work tirelessly to encourage the proliferation of the means of building them. This is the task of the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei.  He is an able diplomat, and as bold as his predecessor, Hans Blix, in standing up to the global powers. But what he is obliged to take away with one hand, he is obliged to give with the other. His message to the non-nuclear powers is this: you are not allowed to develop the bomb, but we will give you the materials and expertise with which you can build one. It is this mortal contradiction which permitted the government of Iran this weekend to tell him to bog off.  His agency's motto - ""Atoms for Peace"" - wasn't always a lie. In 1953, when Eisenhower founded it with his famous speech to the United Nations, people really seemed to believe that nuclear fission could solve the world's problems. An article in the Herald Tribune, for example, promised that atomic power would create ""an earthly paradise... Our automobiles eventually will have atomic energy units built into them at the factory so that we will never have to refuel them... In a relatively short time we will cease to mine coal.""  Eisenhower seemed convinced that the nuclear sword could be beaten into the nuclear ploughshare. ""It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace."" The nuclear powers, he said, ""should... make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials"" which should then be given to ""the power-starved areas of the world"", ""to provide abundant electrical energy"". This would give them, he argued, the necessary incentive to forswear the use of nuclear weapons.  The IAEA, its statute says, should assist ""the supplying of materials, equipment, or facilities"" to non-nuclear states. It should train nuclear scientists and ""foster the exchange of scientific and technical information"". Its mission, in other words, is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons, while spreading nuclear technology to as many countries as possible. It is also responsible for enforcing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which has the same dual purpose.  There might have been a case, while Eisenhower's dream could still be dreamt. But to persist with this programme long after it became clear that it caused proliferation, not containment,   suggests that the global powers are living in a world of make-believe. The International Atomic Energy Agency has put nuclear technology ""into the hands of those who will know how to strip its civilian casing and adapt it to the arts of war"".  It's not difficult. Every state which has sought to develop a nuclear weapons programme over the past 30 years - Israel, South Africa, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Iraq - has done so by diverting resources from its nuclear power programme. In some cases they built their weapons with the direct assistance of Atoms for Peace.  India developed its bomb with the help of fissionable material and expertise from Canada, the US, Germany, France, Norway and the UK. Pakistan was able to answer the threat with the help of Canada, the US, Germany, France, Belgium, China and the UK. In the name of peace, we equipped these nations for total war.  Now there are about 20 countries which, as a result of foreign help for their civilian nuclear programmes, could, if they choose, become nuclear weapons states within months. When Russia shipped uranium and the technologies required to build a bomb to Iran, it not only had a right to do so: under the non-proliferation treaty, it had a duty to do so.  It's not yet clear whether Iran has stepped over the brink. It is plainly enriching uranium and producing heavy water, which could enable it to build both uranium- and plutonium-based bombs. But both processes are also legitimate means of developing materials for nuclear power generation. To enrich uranium from power-grade to bomb-grade you need only pass it through the centrifuges a few more times. The non-proliferation treaty gives Iran both the right to own the materials and the cover it requires to use them for a weapons programme. If you want to build a bomb, you simply sign the treaties, join the IAEA, then use your entitlements to do what they were designed to prevent.  Iran certainly has plenty of motives for seeking to become a nuclear power. Israel has enough nuclear weapons to wipe it off the map. Sheltered by the US, it has no incentive to dismantle them and sign the non-proliferation treaty. Both the US and the UK have abandoned their own obligations to disarm, and appear to be contemplating a new generation of nuclear weapons. Both governments have also suggested that they would be prepared to use them pre-emptively. Iran is surrounded by American military bases, and is one of the two surviving members of the axis of evil. The other one, North Korea, has been threatening its neighbours with impunity. Why? Because it has the bomb. If Iran is not developing a nuclear weapons programme, it hasn't understood the drift of global politics.   But what can El Baradei do? He can beg Iran to stop developing enriched uranium, but the treaty he is supposed to be enforcing gives him no authority to do so: the government has pointed out that it's legally entitled to pursue all the processes he fears. This is why he's seeking to persuade it to stick to ""voluntary agreements"".  I hope I don't need to explain how dangerous all this is. The official nuclear powers have junked the non-proliferation treaty, while the non-nuclear powers are using it to develop their own programmes. If Hizbullah clobbers Israel, Israel might turn on Iran, and the Middle East could go up in nuclear dust, rapidly followed by everyone else who has decided to join the second nuclear arms race. And the man charged with preventing this from happening is still facilitating it.  The obvious conclusion is that you can't phase out nuclear weapons without phasing out nuclear power. Now that the old treaty has become worse than useless, now that the promise of an earthly paradise of free power and electricity too cheap to meter has been shown to be false, isn't it time for a new nuclear treaty, based not on Eisenhower's chiliastic fantasy but on grim global realities? Isn't it time for Mr Baradei to stop destroying the world in order to save it?  www.monbiot.com"

It seems unbelievable that those who watched Lauren suffer could shuffle their feet, like awkward spectators at a stranger's deathbed, as a child was inched towards her grave. It is unspeakable, too, that social services should lace their culpability with such cynicism. The official valediction to brief lives now contains two strands. First, supply extra money, or expect more deaths. The second message, whispered as the Climbi inquiry continues, is that professionals should not have their errors paraded, lest potential care workers shun this blighted system.   Such arguments brand at-risk children as economic bait. It is, however, true that the Government is so miserly on child protection that English authorities have overspent by 500 million this year, just to provide the thin back-up that allowed Lauren and Victoria's killings. Diverting money into favoured, and successful, Government initiatives, such as Sure Start, means less for basic services. Promises to eradicate child poverty, linked closely to neglect, sound hopeful, but 4.3 million British children remain poor. The Prime Minister lauds America, where the impoverished black child may aspire to high office. We shall see soon how the Colin Powell model will play out here.   Poverty is not the only issue. Nor is a pernicious minority of brutes who torture children the sole problem, though it is the least tractable. Michael Stone, the murderer of Lin and Megan Russell and a man no doubt immortalised some where in a sweet-faced school snapshot, was beaten by his stepfather at the age of one and abused by social workers. We understand how to create monsters. We do not know how to redeem them. Notions of parenting classes for the inadequate are little more than a sop for middle class do-gooders with the warm idea that cruelty is amenable to the intervention of a Dr Spockish government.   But the state is a dreadful parent. It is responsible for care home scandals. It presides,  in loco parentis, over the young offenders' institutions that, for all the warnings, still corrupt and kill. We weep, rightly, for murdered toddlers, but children discovered hanging in a Feltham cell die without public lament or remark. What binds such victims to each other, and to all those whose lives will never be corroded by cruelty, is absence of power.   Adults see children as their property. The law is cavalier. A child can be arrested and strip-searched at 10 but not interviewed by police until he or she is 14. Children can drink alcohol at five but not buy a pet kitten before the age of 12. It took until last year for the Home Office to issue guidance that child prostitutes were abuse victims, not criminals. A few weeks ago Scotland announced its plan to outlaw smacking for the under-threes. Westminster proposals are imminent, and child protection charities fear that a government that recently sanctioned smacking by childminders might restrict the ban to babies only.   Outlawing smacking altogether is imperative. Those who hesitated to report Tracey Wright as she went about the legalised business of battering her child might have thought again. Such a ban would also impact on parents, Blair and   Blunkett included, who see no great harm in a remedial swipe. It would symbolise a fairer world for children and end the idea that Article 12 of the Human Rights Convention is, like recorder lessons and broccoli, desirable but inessential.   A lack of rights for children drives society's failings. That absence feeds the confidence of torturers, the apathy of protectors and the vagueness of government reformers. It underpins the cruel practice of keeping children with their birth parents when all reason and humanity demands their removal. It genuflects to the madness of a system in which it is legal to assault a child but not a grown-up. It makes adults, the monstrous and the kind alike, complicit in neglect.   So, reform the child care system. Have a Children's Commissioner, as the NSPCC and others demand. But a slicker, more accountable structure will not be enough. We have the worst child poverty and infant mortality rates in Europe. A quarter of recorded rape victims are children. One in five children is mentally ill. Another child will be killed by a parent before this week is over. The charge sheet, if there ever is one, is likely to say manslaughter, not murder. The presumption is that the premeditated slaughter of a child is a lesser crime. What are the remedies against such horrors?   'We deserve to know why,' Lauren's MP said, as she demanded an inquiry into her death. But we do know why. And the lesson, not yet absorbed, of Victoria's and Lauren's deaths is that children, not adults, are the deserving ones. They need more rights, more legal protection, more compassion. They need more than old stereotypes of evil and of innocence. They need solutions to disaster that go beyond a tired litany of official regret laced with laments on overwork. They deserve better than a society that turns its back on the ugly fate of living children while weeping at the beauty of the dead.","Once there was heroin chic.

0,"Dead children always look so beautiful. Victoria Climbi's curls are held with yellow ties, and her smile is hopeful. Lauren Wright has blonde bunches caught in rosebud ribbons. The girls' school photos, shot in a rare instant of peace or pretence, bear no relationship to the reality of their lives. One child was left in a sack of excrement in a cold bath; the other was pulverised like steak on a butcher's slab and left to die. In the face of such incomprehensible brutality, the pictures tell a simpler horror story. A murderous great-aunt adjusted the yellow hair ties. A killer stepmother fixed the rosebud ribbons. The clash of normality and evil appals and also, in some curious way, absolves us. We are detached and at a loss to comprehend.  Such wickedness, we think, does not brush ordinary lives. It does now. The Climbi inquiry is a recital of blight and official blindness in the anonymous inner city. The case of Lauren Wright demonstrates how a peaceful Norfolk village, with a church, an ivy-clad pub and 300 inhabitants, can double as a torture chamber. Neighbours and teachers looked on as Lauren's weight fell and her bruises spread. Tracey Wright, a playground helper, felt sufficiently emboldened by communitarian spirit to brutalise her in public and encourage her own children to spit in their stepsister's face.   What sort of a woman commits such atrocities? Cruel, sadistic, not clever but very cunning. And familiar. The monstrous mother has existed since the time of Euripides and before. While Tracey Wright may not qualify as a modern   Medea, she is a recognisable figure in the canon of evil. Nor is there anything new in the modern continuum of child torture. Every week in Britain, at least one child dies at the hands of a parent or carer. As the NSPCC points out, the roll call of child killing has continued uninterrupted since Maria Colwell was murdered in the early 70s. For all the reforms and promises, we have made no impact at all.   But the culture that spawns viciousness evolves in terrifying ways.

There are not enough young people to pay for society's old ones as it stands, and it's only going to get worse. Nobody wants to blame greater life expectancy, since it seems churlish to go to all that effort to prolong life, only to then complain about it. Instead, people point to the falling birthrate. In the past this has caused some rancour among childless women, who get blamed for this when in fact women who have children, but opt to stop at two, are by far the more statistically influential group.The Institute for Public Policy Research has characterised the problem as a ""baby gap"" - women want to have children sooner, and more often, than they do. If maternal desire were satisfied, instead of deferred for the sake of careers, an extra 90,000 babies a year would result. However, owing to the maternal pay gap - which means that a woman of 24 on a medium wage would, should she become a mother, earn &pound;564,000 less over the course of her career - women are putting it off. Sometimes this scotches all chance of becoming a mother; more often, we just have to trim our families down a little.So far, so straightforward - what doesn't seem to be straightforward is the connection between whose pay packet is affected, and who makes all the decisions. We are constantly told what women want, vis-a-vis childbirth, what our priorities are, where our thinking is flawed, which mistakes we're making, how our behaviour affects wider society, and which section of us is driving the trend towards geriatric motherhood.It is absolutely illogical to assume that, just because women do the gory bit at the end, we are in charge of the decision to set the whole business in motion. There are, of course, women who go it alone, banditting sperm from unsuspecting males whom they then screw for cash via the Child Support Agency. These women crop up a lot in execrable radio drama, but very rarely in real life. There are women who end up doing it alone, but this doesn't necessarily mean they decided to have children unilaterally.Pending a more in-depth survey, I imagine that people approach having children the same way they would choosing a holiday or a sofa: in some couples the woman will hold sway; in others, the man will. In lovely, healthy couples, all decisions are made jointly and Relate never gets involved. If people are having children later and later, this must be as much a reflection on what men want as it is on what women want. Lots of you could probably offer me case studies about this or that woman who refused tenancy of her womb for her 20s and 30s because she was having too much fun or earning too much; but for every one of them, there'll be another who was badgering for children from the word go, dismissing financial considerations with a nonchalant ""What do babies need? Love and milk!""And yet we never discuss this as a social trend. Generally, we discuss it as a female trend; just as we never discuss childcare in terms of the damage wrought by ""working parents"", only by ""working mothers"". The process of reproducing is always collaborative when it's going well; the fault of women when it isn't. It's so glaring, I'm always amazed that people think they can get away with it, and yet there it is again in reports that ""work pressures force young women to shelve plans for a family"". From the Observer!Having children is almost always a joint decision; a maternal pay cut is almost always assessed in the context of two salaries; men are invariably involved. This isn't something they're suckered into while they're trying to watch the football."

His fondness for this hymn to unsung heroes must mean he thinks George Eliot an ally in bolstering respect for the monarchy. Perhaps the prince does not know that she was much more subversive than the torpid hordes now declining to make jellies for the jubilee. During a flirtation with republicanism, Eliot referred to Victoria, her contemporary and sometime fan, as 'our little humbug of a queen'. Which just shows that you are never safe from cynics. Charles Clarke thinks elements of the press are 'actually about promotion of cynicism'. Tony Blair, on his recent visit to Africa, lambasted 'the cynics back home'. Greg 'cut the crap' Dyke offers yellow cards to can't-do sceptics on his staff, and Gavyn Davies berates 'white, middle-class, middle-aged' whingers complaining about dumbing down the BBC. Alas, Mr Davies's tirade has only invoked a further flurry of cynicism from those who fear that, if Rolf Harris is the jewel of arts programming, it cannot be long before nu-metal band Slipknot is kicking Saint-Sans off Radio 3.  We are losing faith in old institutions, and they are losing faith in us. Early next month, the political philosopher Onora O'Neill will address the first of her BBC Reith lectures to the collapse of trust between the British people and the Civil Service, the medical profession, politicians, church and business. It is not certain what Lord Reith might have thought of Mr Dyke's 'Operation Top   Dog' fact-finding trip to the United States, complete with a stay in a hotel reportedly favoured by Mick Jagger. Nor is it known what Baroness O'Neill, a latter-day Kantian and Lords cross-bencher, will make of her subject matter. I hope she calls it for the cynics.  Cynicism is the fuel of public life. When political ideology and money get sparse, it is a prime deliverer of standards and probity. Blind trust in business is, post-Enron, only for the gullible and shredder salesmen. Unquestioning belief in doctors led to abysmal regulation and arrogance. Those are replaced now, thanks to cynicism, with greater transparency, convictions for the Dewhurst branch of gynaecology, plus the hope that babies are no longer likely to be killed at Bristol or bottled at Alder Hey.  But for cynicism, we might marvel at the altruism of Edward and Sophie, believe that Signor Berlusconi is the new prophet of workplace fairness and trust that women who use the right brand of shampoo can rely on mermaid hair. No wonder politicians search for the elixir of squandered faith.  Too late. Cynicism is the new politics, and how useful it can be to Ministers professing to abhor it. In an age of innocence, Mr Blair's endorsement of creationist teaching at Emmanuel School in Gateshead would be truly worrying. Now it matters less that children, as neo-Darwinians such as Richard Dawkins rightly protest, are being fed 'ludicrous falsehoods'.  The failsafe is that children, even sheltered ones, are cynical rationalists. The debate between evolution and creation was settled, for good and in the former's favour, in the 1860 Oxford debate between between T.H. Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce. Any teacher now hopeful of persuading streetwise Limp Bizkit fans that God created the world quicker than Glenys Kinnock can rustle up a Fray Bentos supper is likely also to believe in Santa Claus.  But politicians think scepticism a sin to be excised. There is something sly, cynical even, in their attempts to re-engage an electorate of whom fewer than 60 per cent voted in the last election. (Even this figure is less worrying in the context of Robert Mugabe's 112 per cent turn-out in some polling stations, but that is by the way.) Moves towards e-democracy and away from in-your-face campaigning are about machinery, not message. Nor do Ministers acknowledge their own double standard. Apathy, the hated twin of cynicism, is the Ritalin of the masses and thus the drug of political dreams.  If people were as apathetic as politicians complain, there would have been no fuel protests, no anti-globalisation marches, no MMR furore, no Garbagegate. While not all of these are desirable, they demonstrate plenty of engagement in politics. It's just all the wrong sort, supposedly practised by selfish, embittered carpers encouraged to stick the boot into the corpse of deference by a cynical media in thrall to New Cynicism.  Old cynicism looked different. The founder of the Cynic sect, Antisthenes, was a fifth-century BC philosopher so avid for moral wisdom that he travelled every day from Piraeus to Athens (tricky by public transport, even in pre-Byers times) to hear Socrates speak. His disciples' code of strict religious observance, ragged cloaks and revolt against decadence seems, give or take Mittalgate, pink pinstripes by Sir Paul Smith and a BlairForce One jet (cancelled), more in tune with the pious ways of political leaders than with the electorate. Who are the real cynics now?  It's hard to judge, when each side thinks the other so corrupted. The certainty is that politicians have not grasped that the British electorate, while abhorring mendacity and sleaze, prefers cynicism to zealotry in its leaders. Morality drives Tony Blair to support currently indefensible action against Iraq. George Bush, a President of unimpeachable godliness, maintains his   axis of good by tearing up weapons treaties and sending a mentally-ill mother who killed her children to jail for 40 years. If this is virtue, one can only wonder what terrors Saddam's evil entails.  We will have to keep on guessing. The dossier that appalled Mr Bush and Mr Blair is locked in Dick Cheney's briefcase, to be fluttered in front of Middle Eastern leaders who seemed suspiciously unscandalised by the Vice-President's proof. In less doubting times, any government move towards military action against Iraq would be deemed as scrupulously tested as a Which? best-buy toasted-sandwich maker. Instead, there is scant enthusiasm. So thank heavens for cynicism, the province of satirists from Molire to Wilde and the last long-stop of democracy. We are going to need it.  That doesn't mean that Mr Blair fails wholly to understand public disillusion. In his convincing speech at the LSE, the Prime Minister ditched the messianic, rabbit-out-of-the-hat salvationism pitched somewhere between Martin Luther King and Paul Daniels. His gospel of public service delivery won't enthuse potential voters, any more than Barcelona smallprint will captivate those stuck on a commuter train at Luton Parkway. But as a move towards the more sober dialogue the Government wants, calm objectives beat both hot rhetoric and the anti-media witchhunts so popular with Ministers and royalty.  As Charles should consider next time he dusts off his  Middlemarch, such tactics offer an uncomfortable echo of Jonathan Aitken's promise to beat 'bent and twisted journalism' with his 'simple sword of truth'. Establishment moaners will have to find a better remedy against public scornfulness. It would be helpful to Mr Blair if young people were inspired by activism, but grassroots politics, like Passing Cloud cigarettes and jitterbugging, is a redundant craving. Enthusing voters will become easy only when government rebrands cynicism as the manna it professes to crave; the holy grail of reasoned opposition."

In an interview published on the same day, and headlined, ""the war ended 60 years ago - get over it"", the German ambassador, Thomas Matussek asserted that the British retain ""an obsession with the Nazi period"", while remaining, he alleged, lamentably ignorant about contemporary Germany. One would not want to exaggerate, and describe it as an ambassadorial obsession, but it has become something of a tradition for German dignitaries to get exercised on this point - so much so that they sometimes seem to forget how very many people, in contemporary Britain, never give the war a second thought. True, the 1995 VE day celebrations were extensive, joyful, and very well attended. But 10 years on, Tony Blair was too busy picking out a gift for Shaun Woodward to put on his doleful face, insert the crack in his voice, and lose a few minutes praying at the Cenotaph.  The ambassadors might also remember that, due to a prior engagement with Bono in Davos, Blair had to declare himself unavailable for a ceremony in January, commemorating the liberation of Auschwitz. In this country, the ceremonies for VE and and VJ day are to be merged into an all purpose commemorative day on July 10.  The prime minister's conspicuous no-show in Moscow earlier this week was only the latest indication that the government has, to quite a remarkable degree, got over it. And yet Matussek rehearses the preoccupations of his predecessor, Gebhardt von Moltke (who asked if British history lessons stopped with the death of Hitler), and of Michael Naumann, the former culture minister, who complained in 1999 that Britain, alone in the world, ""has decided to make the second world war a sort of spiritual core of its national self, understanding and pride"".  Assuming he was correct about this decision, Naumann would surely allow that we seem to be having some trouble sticking to it. In the absence of any significant public recognition of VE day, which will be the last major anniversary witnessed by many survivors, it has been left to the BBC to draw attention to this shrinking generation. In Charles Wheeler's compelling Radio 4 series, Coming   Home, survivors of different nationalities, offer accounts of the aftermath of war - not only the arduous homecomings of 1945, but its legacy today. A woman whose husband was killed in action explained how she still dreams, if anything, she said, more vividly than before, of her husband's safe return.  Devoid of triumphalism, self-congratulation, Vera Lynn-impersonating mawk, Nazi-bashing, or whatever it is that vexes German ambassadors when they spend too long reading the Sun - the radio series makes for wrenching listening, suggesting that, far from getting over it, as a country, we still have much to learn about the war, the more pressingly while there are still survivors ready to talk. Or should we tell them to get over themselves? In one of Wheeler's programmes, a Japanese PoW, David Wilson, remembered how his father, a vicar, did not want to listen. ""I was desperate to tell him what the Japanese were like."" The vicar remained, his son said, utterly uncompassionate. ""It was beneath his dignity to ask what conditions were like.""  In the light of such accounts, Blair's recent reluctance to attend various important 60th-anniversary commemorations appears all the more mysterious. What explanation does he have, for spurning the ceremony at Auschwitz, and sending Jack Straw in his place? For using John Reid as a surrogate at the Cenotaph? For offering John Prescott to the statesmen's line-up in Red Square? If only we could attribute it to Blair's shrewd anticipation of Putin's Stalinist choreography. Or think of this and his other absences as the tactless mistakes of a busy man, rather than as distressing lapses of feeling and judgment. Although Blair is routinely said to have no sense of the past, his non-appearance alongside old allies in this piece of instant historical imagery seems an uncharacteristic oversight for a man who devotes so much thought to his place in history - which he seems to regard as a severe schoolmistress, who will one day tot up his marks and choose whether to damn him, forgive him, or award him some sort of special prize for achievement.  But perhaps, being ostensibly to commemorate the defeat of Nazism, the Moscow solemnities struck Blair as belonging to a part of history which does not interest him overmuch: that long, dark, dreary bit before he came along. We now appreciate that he prefers forward-looking 21st-century celebrations in a brand new dome filled with grateful tinies, to weepy, regressive events featuring Churchilliana and old women.  This perhaps explains why, instead of VE day, British veterans will have to be satisfied with a replacement event in July, scheduled for a day on which, 60 years ago, no one gathered to celebrate, because nothing in particular had happened. It may be a bit soon to claim we're really over Hitler and the Nazis, but even the German ambassador would have to admit, it's a start. <b>The most reluctant Lord Adonis</b>With the election behind us and tumble dryers now such a popular household convenience, many Guardian readers have been debating how best to dispose of their used clothes pegs. I entreat you to waste no time in sending them to Lord Adonis, Andrew as was, to help him through the profound revulsion he must feel on having to accept a peerage. As fans from Lord Adonis's newspaper punditry days will   recall, the new lord was once a determined reformer, who used regularly to denounce the creation of ""a quango Lords"", to insist that ""an elected second chamber is needed to provide a necessary measure of parliamentary independence"", and to urge abolition of all the old titles: ""there is no public enthusiasm for lords, ladies and the other feudal relics"".  The destruction of the lords would be, Lord Adonis proposed, ""a blow against the snobbery and anti-democratic imagery which still permeates Britain"". In its place, he wanted a senate, whose members would receive ""not titles, but the simple designation, 'MS' (member of the Senate), after their unadorned name"". But in 1997, bitterly advising readers to ""forget    the dinner jackets and ""call me Tony"", Andy regretted that ""New Labour looks set to uphold the  ancien rgime . . . politicians will still corner the lion's share of the juiciest plums - namely peerages"".  He could not then have known - who could? - how many juicy plums Blair would also reserve for never-elected flatmates, favourites and paying clients such as Lord Powderject. But were he still in the punditry business, it seems a certainty that these shameless creatures, along with their preposterous new titles, would also have been treated to Andy's most condescending line in ridicule. ""I had forgotten that Ted Short, a stalwart of the Wilson cabinets, was still with us"", he once wrote. ""This was easily done, for on retiring from the Commons, Short   disguised himself as Lord Glenamara. When the former Liberal prime minister HH Asquith performed this trick, reincarnating himself as Earl of Oxford, one wag said it was like a suburban villa calling itself Versailles.""  We can only hope, now that Adonis himself has been reincarnated (title tbc), that he will continue to fight against the lordly affectations which have, in the past, brought on such ecstasies of disdain. ""No one,"" Adonis once wrote, ""likes being abolished, particularly when the perks of existence are as pleasant as those of a peer of the realm.""  But I feel sure, don't you, that if we send him a big enough supply of clothes pegs, Mr Blair's favourite member of the  sans culottes will prove the exception to this rule?"
1,"This morning, shortly after he got up, President Bush considered how to get away from ""pettiness and paltriness of mind"". What did his spiritual guide advise? ""Ask God to keep the eyes of your spirit open to the Risen Christ, and it will be impossible for drudgery to damp you."" Thus fortified, Bush resumed hostilities against Iraq. That the president is a devout, born-'again leader of a crusading administration is well known. An article in Newsweek goes into much more detail about his religious practices, evoking the scene ""ahead of the dawn"", when ""even before he brings his wife, Laura, a morning cup of coffee, he goes off to a quiet place to read alone"". Bush's chosen text, Newsweek discloses, is My Utmost for his Highest, a book of devotional readings by Oswald Chambers, an evangelical bible teacher who died in 1917. It provides a biblical text, along with Chambers' commentary, for every day of the year.  Assuming Newsweek is correct, we can all of us, each day, accompany Bush on his spiritual journey. Tomorrow, for example, he is due to contemplate a passage headed Undaunted Radiance, in which Chambers reminds the sinner that ""the experiences of life, terrible or monotonous, are impotent to touch the love of God...""  The calendar format allows us to look back at key moments in this conflict and identify the spiritual text which might have informed the president's day. On January 20, when he announced that he was ""sick and tired of games and deception"", Bush would have begun with a pre-dawn reflection on Isaiah's response to God's call, ""Here am I; send me"". On February 20, the day Bush agreed, with Blair, on a ""final ultimatum"" he would have considered Chapman's exhortation to action, ""always beware of giving over to mere dreaming once God has spoken"". And if, as was reported then, concerted military attack is still fixed for March 14, then that morning Bush will have his mind on higher things: ""There is no release in human power at all, but only in the Redemption"".  Transcribed by Chambers' wife, Gertrude, after his death from appendicitis, My Utmost for His Highest is less concerned with tips on appropriate conduct, than with the forging of an intimate relationship with God: ""If the crisis has come to you on any line, surrender your will to Him absolutely and irrevocably.""  Spiritually, Chapman is a challenging, relentlessly demanding teacher; in worldly terms, he suggests an almost fatalistic surrender to God's purpose (to be disclosed by the God-given outcome of things), which apparently made Chapman popular among troops in Egypt, where he volunteered as an army chaplain during the first world war. At his funeral, according to Oswald Chambers Publications Association Ltd, the charity which holds world rights in his work, 100 men escorted the gun carriage. The charity's general manager, Mary Hutchison, suggests that his purpose was to impart faith to the soldiers, ""so they could be seen through the crisis"".  Today, with both the Pope and the Anglican church condemning war with Iraq as unjust, you can see how Chapman's message of resolute submission to the Almighty might have considerable appeal for America's commander-in-chief, as he confronts the ""axis of evil"". ""Rise to the occasion, do the thing,"" Chapman urges, ""May God not find the whine in us any more, but may he find us full of spiritual pluck and athleticism, ready to face anything he brings"".  To Hutchison's regret, such reflections have never been as popular here as in the US, where ""Utmost"", as she calls it, has sold two million copies since 1991. In Britain it sells 500 copies a month. Thanks to George Bush, that might change. ""I can't tell you how pleased I am"", she says, ""we're so pleased, we've been praying for years that there would be some kind of revival"". Sometimes, God moves in a most mysterious way. <B>But what about snake oil?</B> Imagine the excitement of Mark Field's London constituents when, for the first time anyone could recall, the Conservative MP wrote asking for comments ""on three issues of national importance"". At last - an MP who really cared what they thought about the war, foundation hospitals, climate change, or similar. But it seems Field is kept awake, of a night, by more pressing questions relating to licensing hours, broadcast communications, and perhaps dearest to his heart, snake oil.   ""I am a regular taker of vitamin supplements"", confessed Field, asking his constituents if alternative medicine should be ""embraced more actively"".  Although, with a war almost on, some constituents find Field's investigations faintly superfluous, such democratic commitment, extending, he stresses, to those who are anxious ""about the harmful health effects of dogs defecating in the streets"", is surely exemplary. And besides, maybe he knows of a good alternative smallpox remedy.<B>Cull New Labour</B>Critics of the impending ruddy duck cull argue that it sets an alarming precedent, and certainly if duck-purity principles were to be applied to British political fauna the consequences would be devastating. Given the similarities between the plight of the rare, white-headed duck and that of the endangered British Tory, now vigorously interbreeding with New Labour to produce a probably sterile hybrid, there is every reason, following ruddy duck logic, to carry out a cull of the American intruder. With some scientists concerned that there may be only one native Tory breeding pair left in the country (Mr and Mrs Nicholas Soames), time is short. True, at 915 per bird - or politician - the cost of such intervention is high and might outrage the British public. On the other hand ducks are widely preferred to MPs; in the absence of any politician welfare groups, the ruthless extermination of New Labour might be seen for what it is, a well-meaning attempt to give nature a helping hand. <B>Torygraph goes gothic</B>Readers of the Daily Telegraph, which has just been subjected to an amusing redesign, are divided on the merits of its gothic-style masthead. Is the heavy typeface once chosen by David Beckham to memorialise the birth of his son in a buttock-skimming tattoo, really up-to-the-minute enough for a happening young paper like the Telegraph? After all, Brooklyn has just celebrated his fourth birthday. But a new Heineken advertising campaign featuring similar lettering on the stomach of the young singer Craig David, confirms that the redesign was worth every penny: in the tattoo parlours that presumably contain its target audience of goths, football fans and connoisseurs of fine lagers, the brand new Telegraph will be a must-have.","B>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Thursday November 20 2003</B><BR><BR>In the column below, sub-headlined ' Presidents and the right to protest', we may unintentionally have given the impression that Jiang Zemin is still the Chinese president. He was succeeded by Hu Jintao in November 2002.  <BR><BR>  <B><HR size=""1""></HR></B>  <BR><BR> Here are some things that people think. The majority of people, anyway. People think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best books ever written. People approve of the reintroduction of capital punishment (lethal injection, for preference). People want fox hunting banned. Their favourite song is Bohemian Rhapsody. People believe in ghosts and are in favour of identity cards. Their favourite meal is fish and chips and they feel sure GM food is a very bad thing. Almost half of them don't think the MMR jab is safe. People underestimate the hygiene complications of preparing a Christmas turkey. They have never heard of the European Constitution. They think parents have the right to know the name and address of any sex offender in the neighbourhood. They think parental selection of a baby's gender is so awful it should be banned. Mercifully, for those who deviate from the majority position on most of the above, the public view does not have to be emulated, or obeyed. We are not subject to its moronic line on literature, music or the paranormal. On gender selection, however, the feelings of the mob are to be enforced. When Suzy Leather, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, explained why this body, after a year's review, now advocates a ban on sex selection, the main reason adduced for the decision was that the majority of people say they don't like the idea. Or as Leather put it, there is ""a substantial public consensus against sex selection for social reasons"". In this area, then, the conduct of your private life is to be directed by public consultation backed by a Mori poll. Unless, that is, you have the energy and cash to defy the public fiat: sex selection is legally available, at a price, at private clinics in America and across the Channel.  Quite why ""people"" should be so against this ostensibly not very wicked expression of a preference is not easily understood. If people had concluded, having completed the relevant research, that gender selection might result in a great preponderance of girls or boys, or an increased number of abortions or incidence of neglect, then one might sympathise with their fears, when polled. The deputy chairman of the HFEA, Tom Baldwin, has said that much of the opposition sprang from ""widespread hostility"", and from anxieties about a ""slippery slope"". So it is not because sex selection was found wanting by the HFEA experts, you gather, so much as to assuage the public's nightmares about designer babies or hundreds of mini-Bin Ladens (quite understandable if you watch a lot of late-night television) that women such as Nicola Chenery, of Plymouth, who really wanted a daughter after her four boys, should now be prevented from having sex selection by IVF at a clinic in Spain. If this decisive body of technophobes had got their way a bit earlier, Chenery's twin baby girls would never have been born. How fortunate, in fact, that Mori polls were not in charge around the time IVF was invented. Ditto blood transfusion and heart transplants.  But it's true: slippery slopes can be awfully worrying. What, for example, are the implications of the HFEA's deferral to public opinion in a country where politicians customarily go to great lengths to avoid doing what the public actually wants? Should we now look forward to seeing paedophiles in the stocks, zero fuel tax, the prohibition of speed limits, a quick exit from Europe and the immediate expulsion of all asylum seekers?  The HFEA's recourse to public sentiment suggests that consultation should go much further than that. Most of us, after all, have some acquaintance with the issues of crime and of tax-paying, some opinion on public services. In the case of sex selection, there can be no recourse to experience or, even, to folk wisdom. It's a question many poll respondents might never have considered before - unless you count inclining, secretly, to one sex or the other.  If fertility experts on the Clapham omnibus can decide policy on gender selection as well as the outcome of Pop Idol, there is no reason why they should not be invited to rule on other scientific advances likely to prompt substantial ethical debate. Those clinicians currently hoping to attempt a facial transplant, for example, and the few gravely disfigured individuals who have expressed interest in the operation, may need to consider not only the profound questions of identity involved in such a procedure, but whether the public will, once again, be so utterly outraged by the affront to nature that doctors, ethicists and prospective patients must all bow to its opinion. <BR><BR><B>Presidents and the right to protest</B><BR><BR>Isn't it time we had Jiang Zemin round? It's been ages and on his last stay, thanks to Robin Cook's insistence on sparing the feelings of the Chinese president, he hardly got to meet anyone. Quite possibly he went home with the idea that the United Kingdom is, leaving aside 1,000-year-old eggs and the occasional peasouper, just like China. A ruthless police state in which any dissent is either concealed from visitors or suppressed, if necessary by violence. But after George Bush's visit, that should all be different, shouldn't it? Even those who maintain that Bush is the vilest ruler of the most evil empire that ever existed must concede that, if his visit helps restore the right to peaceful protest that Cook suddenly withdrew in 1991, it can't have been all bad. Next time Jiang comes to stay, the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens will want to make sure that he sees the welcoming Tibetan flags, banners and T-shirts instead of having all the human rights demonstrators obscured from the presidential view or dragged away by police. Unless, that is, Blair's government has no objection to our shouting abuse at passing democrats, who are probably used to that sort of thing, but draws the line at anything that might offend the sensitive visitor from less tolerant climes.  There's only one way to find out. Come back, Jiang, and next time, bring your mates.<BR><BR><B>Where are the women?</B><BR><BR>Was Patricia Hewitt well advised to make gleeful capital out of Michael Howard's almost all-male shadow cabinet? True, Howard's one-to-12 ratio is almost comically shameful (though he was apparently spurned by Ann Widdecombe). But is Blair's record with women so much better? After the departure, hurt, of Mowlam, Short and Morris, Blair's six senior women (out of a cabinet of 21) are: an extremely disturbed person called Margaret Hodge, who seems in need of a long rest; Tessa Jowell, who is probably busy with the Olympics; the tireless caravanner Margaret Beckett; the not-readily-identifiable Hilary Armstrong; Baroness Valerie Amos (appointed, doesn't count); and Patricia Hewitt herself, who is still having a little difficulty reconciling her 1970s feminism with the present day. The Labour ministers with big jobs, are, like Howard's favourites, all men. Until Labour gets closer to electing a woman leader, any triumphalism in this department looks distinctly premature."

The minister was not trying to cover up his decision to allow a unique listed building in Oxford to be moved, to make way for a business school funded by the arms broker Wafic Said. He had failed to inform the local MP simply because he was away in Egypt, leading a trade mission.  It's still not clear why the government refused to examine an application to dismantle one of the country's most important industrial monuments, or why the prime minister's office felt compelled to intervene in such a trivial matter as the timing of a planning decision. But the most interesting question has yet to be asked: what was the British planning minister doing on a trade delegation to Egypt? The answer suggests that Mr Raynsford's alibi is rather more heinous than the alleged crime.   Mr Raynsford was leading a delegation of 27 corporations. Among them were some of the most controversial multinationals stationed in this country: Balfour Beatty, Enron, Laing, Mott MacDonald, Thames Water and WS Atkins. The projects they visited included Egypt's most contested development scheme: the $90bn Toshka programme to divert the Nile. Environmentalists warn that it will devastate the river's ecology, financial consultants warn that it will have a similar impact on the country's economy. It's the sort of scheme, in other words, which, were it to have been proposed in Britain, should have been subject to the fiercest scrutiny by planning officials at the Department of the Environment (DoE), overseen by Mr Raynsford.   Interestingly, the major beneficiary of the trade mission appears to have been not a British company, but a Norwegian one. Soon after the tour, Kvaerner revealed that it had landed a 266m contract to build a pumping system at Toshka. Kvaerner's otherwise inexplicable presence on a British trade tour might have had something to do with the fact that it had seconded more of its employees into the DoE than any other company.   So why was Mr Raynsford, rather than a minister from the Department of Trade and Industry, helping these companies to sell their wares in Egypt? Well, Nick Raynsford has a curious double role. He is minister for planning, which means he is the regulator of development in Britain. But he is also minister for construction, which means he is the promoter of development in Britain. He routinely resolves this conflict of interests in favour of the industry he's supposed be regulating.   Mr Raynsford has gone to some lengths to show construction companies whose side he is on. ""I see my job,"" he told Building magazine, as ""creating a climate in   which the industry can do well."" To this end, his division has sought repeatedly to undermine government policy. It has sponsored, for example, a public relations offensive for the quarrying industry called Minerals 98. One of its purposes was to help companies lobby against the tax on roadstone that another division of the environment department had proposed.   At Labour's 1998 local government conference, Mr Raynsford argued against the environment department's plans for a tax on out-of-town parking places and in support of the superstores' objections to them. He has promised the British Council of Shopping Centres that he will seek to speed up major new retail schemes. Last week, he undermined the government's commitments on climate change by watering down the rules on energy efficiency in new homes, arguing that the standards were ""an undue burden on builders"".   But perhaps most alarming is his alleged role in the debate about the Ilisu dam in Turkey: the devastating ethnic cleansing project that will drive 78,000 Kurds out of their cultural heartland. It was Mr Raynsford, according to Whitehall sources, who persuaded Tony Blair to back the project. Why should he have done so? Well, in September 1999 he led a trade mission to Turkey. The consortium he accompanied was seeking to land 4bn-worth of contracts for rebuilding after the earthquake. The consortium was fronted by Balfour Beatty, which also happens to be the firm hoping to build the Ilisu dam. Three months later, the British government announced that it was ""minded to grant"" export credit for the Ilisu scheme. Is it possible that Mr Raynsford was told by the Turkish government that British rebuilding contracts were conditional on support for the dam?   The real scandal surrounding the Oxford business school is that everything Mr Raynsford says about it is probably true. There were no peculiar measures taken to approve the development; there was nothing unusual about the government's decision not to review the case. Decisions to turn a blind eye to the destruction of our heritage and environment are taken on behalf of the construction industry every week, by the man who is supposed to be policing it."
1,"Launching his Big Conversation last week, Tony Blair issued a little warning to those enemies of the state who would, he predicted, rubbish this ""real debate"" about the future of our nation. ""There are obvious risks in this. The policy choices are hard. The cynics will sneer."" And if the cynics did sneer, even before the exercise had properly started, those responsible for naming Blair's great mission after a recent management consultancy wheeze at the BBC should perhaps take some of the blame. Almost a week later, with around 50 contributions on the website, the least cynical eavesdropper would have to admit that conversation is, to put it mildly, stilted. A typical participant begins: ""I am so proud to have voted Labour with my first ever vote a few years ago. Everywhere I look I see new cars, wealth, opportunities, investment and most favourable mortgage rates.""  Fellow chatterers do not so much reply to these sallies, as attempt to outstrip them in flattery. Caroline, for instance, speaks highly of British trains. ""I experience a reasonably good rail service as I commute to work in London. When I've needed a doctor or hospital service, the NHS has always delivered the best services quickly."" Other contributors, such as Carrie, contrast their current bliss with the hardship and evil of the old, Thatcherite days. ""I can remember when I was young growing up with Conservatives and my mum had to work every hour to try and keep me and my sister and there was no childcare facilities.""  Another contributor writes: ""In the old days, before the glorious Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under...""  Actually, that comes from the party's history textbook in Orwell's 1984. Still, the intended effect is surely not that different from this Big Conversation contribution from Jayne, a teacher: ""Have people forgotten the poll tax, the massive interest rates and all the sleaze of that administration?"" Or Ian's memories of the 80s when, ""I wallowed on the dole. I was in despair, forever chasing Tory dreams - 'get on your bike', 'woolly hats' etc, etc. Ten years after voting Tony Blair in, I am now in a very well-paid job, I have a property here in the UK and a property in Tenerife (Spain). Things have certainly 'got better' for me and all my friends who have similarly suffered in the past and have excelled under the New Labour parliament.""  Naturally, those running the Big Conversation have realised that, for the sake of credibility, these impeccably loyal effusions need to be balanced with some constructive criticism. A P O'Neill, for example, pleads for ""many more party political broadcasts on TV and radio so we can hear directly from our leaders what they really think, what the problems really involve and how they can be sorted out... The TV and radio should be obliged to carry short government broadcasts each night so that a real debate could be founded on proper information and facts.""  And if I can join in the Big Conversation for a second, why stop there? Ideally, a telescreen in every flat would broadcast party news continually, untroubled by the media cynics and pundits whose carping seem to have upset several contributors to the Big Conversation. Imagine bulletins from Iraq that were uninterrupted by unwelcome equivocation about civilian casualties, brutality, WMDs, but ran along the following lines: ""I am authorised to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end.""  In reality, the war in Iraq is a subject the Big Conversationalists have yet, at the time of writing, to engage with (those Conversationalists, that is, whose contributions have been selected for the website). Ditto international relations, George Bush, terrorism, the EU constitution, drugs, asylum, foundation hospitals, parliamentary democracy, waiting lists, council tax, prisons, the House of Lords, the new supreme court, identity cards and the state of London Underground. On the other hand, experiences of the NHS mentioned here have been, without exception, positive: ""the care... was second to none"". On student fees, there is just the one contribution, from Alex, 19: ""I think tuition fees are important because they make people realise the value of education.""  A foreigner consulting this website to enhance her understanding of this country could only conclude, like the visitors to Stalin's wholesome Potemkin villages, that all is for the best under this best of all possible administrations. Or, as Andy Saxon, who was invited to contribute to the site, put it: ""I think Tony Blair's got an impossible job but he does it well.""  There are, inevitably, various hopeless personal petitions of the sort traditionally reserved for the attention of constituency MPs - who are, presumably, overjoyed to see so many monomaniacs diverted out of their surgeries and into this new bores' paradise. Labour has promised to consider comments from all such supplicants, who currently include: a man who says the NHS dentists near him are full; a woman preoccupied with the A36 bypass; a man who wants classical music on the underground; a woman who says we need legal protection for pagans. So far the only substantial and consistent source of complaint to emerge on the site is anti-social behaviour; a problem which, since it reflects worst on the parents and children responsible, can hardly be attributed to government incompetence.  But the Conversation has only just begun. Perhaps not many people have written in yet. Perhaps its unnerving tone of virtually unqualified approval is not so much the achievement of Labour's thought police, but the result of a complete lack of popular interest. We must hope that in time, with sustained promotion, this ""real debate"" will cease to resemble a letters page from a pre-1989 edition of Pravda. If not, the only illuminating thing about Blair's Big Conversation might well be its unsettling echoes of Orwell's Big Brother. And then those cynics would have a field day.<B>Little people can dump gongs too</B>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown ended her announcement that she plans to return her MBE with a confession that she is not quite sure how one goes about it. Clearly she does not have the good fortune to live in Islington, where the the clatter of unwanted CBEs, MBEs and OBEs recently became so deafening that the council issued each household with a handy honours recyling bin, in which unwanted medals can simply be left on the doorstep every Monday alongside the boxes containing empty Chardonnay bottles and assorted printed refuse. The honours are then melted down and the profits used to start up call centres in former outposts of the British empire.  But as Alibhai-Brown implied, it may be some time before everyone shares the ""self-contempt"" that she now feels at having accepted her honour. With a perceptiveness reminiscent of Leona Helmsley's, who remarked - as a millionairess - that ""only little people pay taxes"", the Independent columnist noted that, ""It is important to remember that the little people are often in the lists which come out - nurses, community activists, dinner ladies - for whom such recognition is priceless...""  What can be done to bridge this gap; to make these endearingly humble dinner ladies and nurses more receptive to the urgings of that latter-day Jiminy Cricket, Benjamin Zephaniah? Maybe, if like Zephaniah and Alibhai-Brown, the grateful nonentities could be offered recognition of a different kind - a newspaper platform, for example, in which to simultaneously advertise and    repudiate the state's recognition of their achievements - they, too, might be encouraged to snub the authorities? Although they cannot, as a general rule, be allowed a whole article each, there seems no reason why in future, the New Year honours lists should not be accompanied by yet more elite, honours-disdained/returned lists, in which conscience-stricken little people can experience, for a moment, just what it feels like to be big.","B>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Thursday November 20 2003</B><BR><BR>In the column below, sub-headlined ' Presidents and the right to protest', we may unintentionally have given the impression that Jiang Zemin is still the Chinese president. He was succeeded by Hu Jintao in November 2002.  <BR><BR>  <B><HR size=""1""></HR></B>  <BR><BR> Here are some things that people think. The majority of people, anyway. People think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best books ever written. People approve of the reintroduction of capital punishment (lethal injection, for preference). People want fox hunting banned. Their favourite song is Bohemian Rhapsody. People believe in ghosts and are in favour of identity cards. Their favourite meal is fish and chips and they feel sure GM food is a very bad thing. Almost half of them don't think the MMR jab is safe. People underestimate the hygiene complications of preparing a Christmas turkey. They have never heard of the European Constitution. They think parents have the right to know the name and address of any sex offender in the neighbourhood. They think parental selection of a baby's gender is so awful it should be banned. Mercifully, for those who deviate from the majority position on most of the above, the public view does not have to be emulated, or obeyed. We are not subject to its moronic line on literature, music or the paranormal. On gender selection, however, the feelings of the mob are to be enforced. When Suzy Leather, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, explained why this body, after a year's review, now advocates a ban on sex selection, the main reason adduced for the decision was that the majority of people say they don't like the idea. Or as Leather put it, there is ""a substantial public consensus against sex selection for social reasons"". In this area, then, the conduct of your private life is to be directed by public consultation backed by a Mori poll. Unless, that is, you have the energy and cash to defy the public fiat: sex selection is legally available, at a price, at private clinics in America and across the Channel.  Quite why ""people"" should be so against this ostensibly not very wicked expression of a preference is not easily understood. If people had concluded, having completed the relevant research, that gender selection might result in a great preponderance of girls or boys, or an increased number of abortions or incidence of neglect, then one might sympathise with their fears, when polled. The deputy chairman of the HFEA, Tom Baldwin, has said that much of the opposition sprang from ""widespread hostility"", and from anxieties about a ""slippery slope"". So it is not because sex selection was found wanting by the HFEA experts, you gather, so much as to assuage the public's nightmares about designer babies or hundreds of mini-Bin Ladens (quite understandable if you watch a lot of late-night television) that women such as Nicola Chenery, of Plymouth, who really wanted a daughter after her four boys, should now be prevented from having sex selection by IVF at a clinic in Spain. If this decisive body of technophobes had got their way a bit earlier, Chenery's twin baby girls would never have been born. How fortunate, in fact, that Mori polls were not in charge around the time IVF was invented. Ditto blood transfusion and heart transplants.  But it's true: slippery slopes can be awfully worrying. What, for example, are the implications of the HFEA's deferral to public opinion in a country where politicians customarily go to great lengths to avoid doing what the public actually wants? Should we now look forward to seeing paedophiles in the stocks, zero fuel tax, the prohibition of speed limits, a quick exit from Europe and the immediate expulsion of all asylum seekers?  The HFEA's recourse to public sentiment suggests that consultation should go much further than that. Most of us, after all, have some acquaintance with the issues of crime and of tax-paying, some opinion on public services. In the case of sex selection, there can be no recourse to experience or, even, to folk wisdom. It's a question many poll respondents might never have considered before - unless you count inclining, secretly, to one sex or the other.  If fertility experts on the Clapham omnibus can decide policy on gender selection as well as the outcome of Pop Idol, there is no reason why they should not be invited to rule on other scientific advances likely to prompt substantial ethical debate. Those clinicians currently hoping to attempt a facial transplant, for example, and the few gravely disfigured individuals who have expressed interest in the operation, may need to consider not only the profound questions of identity involved in such a procedure, but whether the public will, once again, be so utterly outraged by the affront to nature that doctors, ethicists and prospective patients must all bow to its opinion. <BR><BR><B>Presidents and the right to protest</B><BR><BR>Isn't it time we had Jiang Zemin round? It's been ages and on his last stay, thanks to Robin Cook's insistence on sparing the feelings of the Chinese president, he hardly got to meet anyone. Quite possibly he went home with the idea that the United Kingdom is, leaving aside 1,000-year-old eggs and the occasional peasouper, just like China. A ruthless police state in which any dissent is either concealed from visitors or suppressed, if necessary by violence. But after George Bush's visit, that should all be different, shouldn't it? Even those who maintain that Bush is the vilest ruler of the most evil empire that ever existed must concede that, if his visit helps restore the right to peaceful protest that Cook suddenly withdrew in 1991, it can't have been all bad. Next time Jiang comes to stay, the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens will want to make sure that he sees the welcoming Tibetan flags, banners and T-shirts instead of having all the human rights demonstrators obscured from the presidential view or dragged away by police. Unless, that is, Blair's government has no objection to our shouting abuse at passing democrats, who are probably used to that sort of thing, but draws the line at anything that might offend the sensitive visitor from less tolerant climes.  There's only one way to find out. Come back, Jiang, and next time, bring your mates.<BR><BR><B>Where are the women?</B><BR><BR>Was Patricia Hewitt well advised to make gleeful capital out of Michael Howard's almost all-male shadow cabinet? True, Howard's one-to-12 ratio is almost comically shameful (though he was apparently spurned by Ann Widdecombe). But is Blair's record with women so much better? After the departure, hurt, of Mowlam, Short and Morris, Blair's six senior women (out of a cabinet of 21) are: an extremely disturbed person called Margaret Hodge, who seems in need of a long rest; Tessa Jowell, who is probably busy with the Olympics; the tireless caravanner Margaret Beckett; the not-readily-identifiable Hilary Armstrong; Baroness Valerie Amos (appointed, doesn't count); and Patricia Hewitt herself, who is still having a little difficulty reconciling her 1970s feminism with the present day. The Labour ministers with big jobs, are, like Howard's favourites, all men. Until Labour gets closer to electing a woman leader, any triumphalism in this department looks distinctly premature."
0,"Launching his Big Conversation last week, Tony Blair issued a little warning to those enemies of the state who would, he predicted, rubbish this ""real debate"" about the future of our nation. ""There are obvious risks in this. The policy choices are hard. The cynics will sneer."" And if the cynics did sneer, even before the exercise had properly started, those responsible for naming Blair's great mission after a recent management consultancy wheeze at the BBC should perhaps take some of the blame. Almost a week later, with around 50 contributions on the website, the least cynical eavesdropper would have to admit that conversation is, to put it mildly, stilted. A typical participant begins: ""I am so proud to have voted Labour with my first ever vote a few years ago. Everywhere I look I see new cars, wealth, opportunities, investment and most favourable mortgage rates.""  Fellow chatterers do not so much reply to these sallies, as attempt to outstrip them in flattery. Caroline, for instance, speaks highly of British trains. ""I experience a reasonably good rail service as I commute to work in London. When I've needed a doctor or hospital service, the NHS has always delivered the best services quickly."" Other contributors, such as Carrie, contrast their current bliss with the hardship and evil of the old, Thatcherite days. ""I can remember when I was young growing up with Conservatives and my mum had to work every hour to try and keep me and my sister and there was no childcare facilities.""  Another contributor writes: ""In the old days, before the glorious Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under...""  Actually, that comes from the party's history textbook in Orwell's 1984. Still, the intended effect is surely not that different from this Big Conversation contribution from Jayne, a teacher: ""Have people forgotten the poll tax, the massive interest rates and all the sleaze of that administration?"" Or Ian's memories of the 80s when, ""I wallowed on the dole. I was in despair, forever chasing Tory dreams - 'get on your bike', 'woolly hats' etc, etc. Ten years after voting Tony Blair in, I am now in a very well-paid job, I have a property here in the UK and a property in Tenerife (Spain). Things have certainly 'got better' for me and all my friends who have similarly suffered in the past and have excelled under the New Labour parliament.""  Naturally, those running the Big Conversation have realised that, for the sake of credibility, these impeccably loyal effusions need to be balanced with some constructive criticism. A P O'Neill, for example, pleads for ""many more party political broadcasts on TV and radio so we can hear directly from our leaders what they really think, what the problems really involve and how they can be sorted out... The TV and radio should be obliged to carry short government broadcasts each night so that a real debate could be founded on proper information and facts.""  And if I can join in the Big Conversation for a second, why stop there? Ideally, a telescreen in every flat would broadcast party news continually, untroubled by the media cynics and pundits whose carping seem to have upset several contributors to the Big Conversation. Imagine bulletins from Iraq that were uninterrupted by unwelcome equivocation about civilian casualties, brutality, WMDs, but ran along the following lines: ""I am authorised to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end.""  In reality, the war in Iraq is a subject the Big Conversationalists have yet, at the time of writing, to engage with (those Conversationalists, that is, whose contributions have been selected for the website). Ditto international relations, George Bush, terrorism, the EU constitution, drugs, asylum, foundation hospitals, parliamentary democracy, waiting lists, council tax, prisons, the House of Lords, the new supreme court, identity cards and the state of London Underground. On the other hand, experiences of the NHS mentioned here have been, without exception, positive: ""the care... was second to none"". On student fees, there is just the one contribution, from Alex, 19: ""I think tuition fees are important because they make people realise the value of education.""  A foreigner consulting this website to enhance her understanding of this country could only conclude, like the visitors to Stalin's wholesome Potemkin villages, that all is for the best under this best of all possible administrations. Or, as Andy Saxon, who was invited to contribute to the site, put it: ""I think Tony Blair's got an impossible job but he does it well.""  There are, inevitably, various hopeless personal petitions of the sort traditionally reserved for the attention of constituency MPs - who are, presumably, overjoyed to see so many monomaniacs diverted out of their surgeries and into this new bores' paradise. Labour has promised to consider comments from all such supplicants, who currently include: a man who says the NHS dentists near him are full; a woman preoccupied with the A36 bypass; a man who wants classical music on the underground; a woman who says we need legal protection for pagans. So far the only substantial and consistent source of complaint to emerge on the site is anti-social behaviour; a problem which, since it reflects worst on the parents and children responsible, can hardly be attributed to government incompetence.  But the Conversation has only just begun. Perhaps not many people have written in yet. Perhaps its unnerving tone of virtually unqualified approval is not so much the achievement of Labour's thought police, but the result of a complete lack of popular interest.

Extremists have to abandon, or at any rate disguise, their passions, and move to positions as close to being all things to all fickle voters as they can invent. That's how Tony Blair made Labour electable. The coalitions of continental Europe are built round the same inescapable proposition. In such politics, nuance replaces conviction, and manoeuvre boldness, as the identifying marks of a winning team. What's going on in America as the 2004 election begins is unnervingly the opposite. It's one of the more extraordinary spectacles a political scientist, or journalist, let alone a professional politician, could encounter. George Bush is running his campaign from the same fringe position as the one he has adopted for his presidency.  This is a hard-right administration offering virtually no concessions to the soothing niceties that might make it more electorally attractive to voters who are not Republicans. Its tax policy is grotesquely loaded against the masses and in favour of the rich. Its bias on the environment unfailingly comes out on the side of the big commercial interests. It is daily tearing up tracts of policy and practice that protected the basic rights of people snared in the justice system. It is the hardest right administration since Herbert Hoover's from a very different era. And, which is the point, delights in being so. There is no apology or cover-up.  But even that isn't the most striking thing about the set-up as it now stands. For this we have to turn to the Democrats. Unlike Bush, many Democrats are sticking to the conventional wisdom. They grope for some kind of centre ground. But so far has the territory shifted, thanks to the Republicans' shameless stakeout on the hard right, that their quest continues to drain their party of most of its meaning and any of its capacity to inspire.  The rules are being observed, but we find that in some circumstances these rules are a fallacy. They draw a party so far into the orbit of its rival as to render itself meaningless as anything except a political machine of variable potency around the country. Yet the dominant mode of most presidential candidates is still to cling to the kind of centrism that defines them at best as Bush-lite, at worst as people who have nothing to say that could send the smallest shiver up the spine of afloating voter.  One should hesitate to second-guess all these massively professional politicians, laden with polls. But their reflex looks to me as unnecessary as it is self-destructive. One way to respond to Bush's rewrite of the rule book - which covers more contentious ground than Ronald Reagan's campaigns ever did, for example - may be to meekly accept the new setting for old maxims. The other is to treat the maxims, in present times, as a snare.   For one thing, many Democrats seem to have forgotten that they did win the election last time. For four years it has been idle to challenge the Florida vote and the bizarre workings of the electoral college, but now is the time to recall that in 2000 half a million more Americans voted for Al Gore's progressive version of the future than Bush's more conservative one. Bush was still posing as a bit centrist then, and Gore was scarcely a raving liberal. Gore mostly stuck to the Clinton third way doctrine that had taken the Democrats away from the narrowest version of their past. But there was a left-right choice, and more Americans voted left than right.  In most systems, that would have been another reason for the technical winners to gravitate towards the centre. Since that did not happen, it is instead an excellent reason for the losers to rediscover their raison d'tre. Yet most of them seem mesmerised with terror at the prospect, and full of guff about Democratic ""values"" which they take to excuse them from advancing any awkward Democratic policies.  The Iraq war is to blame for this, but only partly. It is Bush's alibi for everything   else. To the extent that voters dislike his right-wingery on domestic matters, Iraq and terrorism give cover to the Great Leader. We may be sure he will exploit this until the day of the election. It puts Democrats in a bind, though something has changed when dreary Joe Lieberman, an early war supporter, now feels it necessary to bleat defensively that his was a ""principled"" position, and posturing John Kerry - probably the favourite as things stand - calibrates a position edging finely away from believer to mealy-mouthed critic. Another year of Baghdad body bags, with Osama bin Laden still at large, and the politics of the war cannot be so neatly predicted.  For any Democrat to take advantage of Bush's waning popularity and overcome his vast campaign finances, however, he must have something to say. There needs to be some clarity, on all fronts. The other day, the same edition of the New York Times carried stories saying that neither young African-Americans nor the Boston Irish could any longer be counted on as part of the core vote. Is this heresy surprising when nobody knows with any certainty what Democrats stand for? If a party can't fire up its core vote, it will be deader quicker than if it can't draw in people who've never voted for it before. Watching what Bush has done to both the economy and the constitution, it should be easy for a Democrat to come up with soundbites and articles of simple faith to inspire a few more than the millions of Americans who voted for Gore last time.  Wiseacres continue to pretend otherwise. They think Howard Dean, the most lefty of the candidates, and former governor of the state of Vermont, could never get elected. Transfixed by the attractions of triangulated centrism, they're prepared to have its geometry laid out exclusively by their opponents. They come out against a bit of the Bush tax plan but not all of it. They're all but silent, as are much of the media, on what anti-terrorism psychosis is doing to civil liberties.  Yet the Republicans didn't get where they are today by such half-baked timidity. The challenge they make is for the life and death of the soul of the America very many Americans still believe in. What their opponents need is a leader whose voice rings more eloquently than Bush's - surely not the hardest contest to win. That won't happen until they abandon their backing and filling, and their belief that being a Democrat no longer adds up to anything more than a milder version of their enemies.  ""Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice ... Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" Barry Goldwater said that 40 years ago. It was the start of the recovery of the right. The words now belong rather exactly in the other side's mouth. If they came out of Senator Kerry's this autumn, they'd make him sound less like a calculating wimp."
1,"If it was upsetting to war veterans, last Sunday's barely-there official commemoration of VE day presumably satisfied one leading non-participant. In an interview published on the same day, and headlined, ""the war ended 60 years ago - get over it"", the German ambassador, Thomas Matussek asserted that the British retain ""an obsession with the Nazi period"", while remaining, he alleged, lamentably ignorant about contemporary Germany. One would not want to exaggerate, and describe it as an ambassadorial obsession, but it has become something of a tradition for German dignitaries to get exercised on this point - so much so that they sometimes seem to forget how very many people, in contemporary Britain, never give the war a second thought. True, the 1995 VE day celebrations were extensive, joyful, and very well attended. But 10 years on, Tony Blair was too busy picking out a gift for Shaun Woodward to put on his doleful face, insert the crack in his voice, and lose a few minutes praying at the Cenotaph.  The ambassadors might also remember that, due to a prior engagement with Bono in Davos, Blair had to declare himself unavailable for a ceremony in January, commemorating the liberation of Auschwitz. In this country, the ceremonies for VE and and VJ day are to be merged into an all purpose commemorative day on July 10.  The prime minister's conspicuous no-show in Moscow earlier this week was only the latest indication that the government has, to quite a remarkable degree, got over it. And yet Matussek rehearses the preoccupations of his predecessor, Gebhardt von Moltke (who asked if British history lessons stopped with the death of Hitler), and of Michael Naumann, the former culture minister, who complained in 1999 that Britain, alone in the world, ""has decided to make the second world war a sort of spiritual core of its national self, understanding and pride"".  Assuming he was correct about this decision, Naumann would surely allow that we seem to be having some trouble sticking to it. In the absence of any significant public recognition of VE day, which will be the last major anniversary witnessed by many survivors, it has been left to the BBC to draw attention to this shrinking generation. In Charles Wheeler's compelling Radio 4 series, Coming   Home, survivors of different nationalities, offer accounts of the aftermath of war - not only the arduous homecomings of 1945, but its legacy today. A woman whose husband was killed in action explained how she still dreams, if anything, she said, more vividly than before, of her husband's safe return.  Devoid of triumphalism, self-congratulation, Vera Lynn-impersonating mawk, Nazi-bashing, or whatever it is that vexes German ambassadors when they spend too long reading the Sun - the radio series makes for wrenching listening, suggesting that, far from getting over it, as a country, we still have much to learn about the war, the more pressingly while there are still survivors ready to talk. Or should we tell them to get over themselves? In one of Wheeler's programmes, a Japanese PoW, David Wilson, remembered how his father, a vicar, did not want to listen. ""I was desperate to tell him what the Japanese were like."" The vicar remained, his son said, utterly uncompassionate. ""It was beneath his dignity to ask what conditions were like.""  In the light of such accounts, Blair's recent reluctance to attend various important 60th-anniversary commemorations appears all the more mysterious. What explanation does he have, for spurning the ceremony at Auschwitz, and sending Jack Straw in his place? For using John Reid as a surrogate at the Cenotaph? For offering John Prescott to the statesmen's line-up in Red Square? If only we could attribute it to Blair's shrewd anticipation of Putin's Stalinist choreography. Or think of this and his other absences as the tactless mistakes of a busy man, rather than as distressing lapses of feeling and judgment. Although Blair is routinely said to have no sense of the past, his non-appearance alongside old allies in this piece of instant historical imagery seems an uncharacteristic oversight for a man who devotes so much thought to his place in history - which he seems to regard as a severe schoolmistress, who will one day tot up his marks and choose whether to damn him, forgive him, or award him some sort of special prize for achievement.  But perhaps, being ostensibly to commemorate the defeat of Nazism, the Moscow solemnities struck Blair as belonging to a part of history which does not interest him overmuch: that long, dark, dreary bit before he came along. We now appreciate that he prefers forward-looking 21st-century celebrations in a brand new dome filled with grateful tinies, to weepy, regressive events featuring Churchilliana and old women.  This perhaps explains why, instead of VE day, British veterans will have to be satisfied with a replacement event in July, scheduled for a day on which, 60 years ago, no one gathered to celebrate, because nothing in particular had happened. It may be a bit soon to claim we're really over Hitler and the Nazis, but even the German ambassador would have to admit, it's a start. <b>The most reluctant Lord Adonis</b>With the election behind us and tumble dryers now such a popular household convenience, many Guardian readers have been debating how best to dispose of their used clothes pegs. I entreat you to waste no time in sending them to Lord Adonis, Andrew as was, to help him through the profound revulsion he must feel on having to accept a peerage. As fans from Lord Adonis's newspaper punditry days will   recall, the new lord was once a determined reformer, who used regularly to denounce the creation of ""a quango Lords"", to insist that ""an elected second chamber is needed to provide a necessary measure of parliamentary independence"", and to urge abolition of all the old titles: ""there is no public enthusiasm for lords, ladies and the other feudal relics"".  The destruction of the lords would be, Lord Adonis proposed, ""a blow against the snobbery and anti-democratic imagery which still permeates Britain"". In its place, he wanted a senate, whose members would receive ""not titles, but the simple designation, 'MS' (member of the Senate), after their unadorned name"". But in 1997, bitterly advising readers to ""forget    the dinner jackets and ""call me Tony"", Andy regretted that ""New Labour looks set to uphold the  ancien rgime . . . politicians will still corner the lion's share of the juiciest plums - namely peerages"".  He could not then have known - who could? - how many juicy plums Blair would also reserve for never-elected flatmates, favourites and paying clients such as Lord Powderject. But were he still in the punditry business, it seems a certainty that these shameless creatures, along with their preposterous new titles, would also have been treated to Andy's most condescending line in ridicule. ""I had forgotten that Ted Short, a stalwart of the Wilson cabinets, was still with us"", he once wrote. ""This was easily done, for on retiring from the Commons, Short   disguised himself as Lord Glenamara. When the former Liberal prime minister HH Asquith performed this trick, reincarnating himself as Earl of Oxford, one wag said it was like a suburban villa calling itself Versailles.""  We can only hope, now that Adonis himself has been reincarnated (title tbc), that he will continue to fight against the lordly affectations which have, in the past, brought on such ecstasies of disdain. ""No one,"" Adonis once wrote, ""likes being abolished, particularly when the perks of existence are as pleasant as those of a peer of the realm.""  But I feel sure, don't you, that if we send him a big enough supply of clothes pegs, Mr Blair's favourite member of the  sans culottes will prove the exception to this rule?","Launching his Big Conversation last week, Tony Blair issued a little warning to those enemies of the state who would, he predicted, rubbish this ""real debate"" about the future of our nation.

Imagine bulletins from Iraq that were uninterrupted by unwelcome equivocation about civilian casualties, brutality, WMDs, but ran along the following lines: ""I am authorised to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end.""  In reality, the war in Iraq is a subject the Big Conversationalists have yet, at the time of writing, to engage with (those Conversationalists, that is, whose contributions have been selected for the website). Ditto international relations, George Bush, terrorism, the EU constitution, drugs, asylum, foundation hospitals, parliamentary democracy, waiting lists, council tax, prisons, the House of Lords, the new supreme court, identity cards and the state of London Underground. On the other hand, experiences of the NHS mentioned here have been, without exception, positive: ""the care... was second to none"". On student fees, there is just the one contribution, from Alex, 19: ""I think tuition fees are important because they make people realise the value of education.""  A foreigner consulting this website to enhance her understanding of this country could only conclude, like the visitors to Stalin's wholesome Potemkin villages, that all is for the best under this best of all possible administrations. Or, as Andy Saxon, who was invited to contribute to the site, put it: ""I think Tony Blair's got an impossible job but he does it well.""  There are, inevitably, various hopeless personal petitions of the sort traditionally reserved for the attention of constituency MPs - who are, presumably, overjoyed to see so many monomaniacs diverted out of their surgeries and into this new bores' paradise. Labour has promised to consider comments from all such supplicants, who currently include: a man who says the NHS dentists near him are full; a woman preoccupied with the A36 bypass; a man who wants classical music on the underground; a woman who says we need legal protection for pagans. So far the only substantial and consistent source of complaint to emerge on the site is anti-social behaviour; a problem which, since it reflects worst on the parents and children responsible, can hardly be attributed to government incompetence.  But the Conversation has only just begun. Perhaps not many people have written in yet. Perhaps its unnerving tone of virtually unqualified approval is not so much the achievement of Labour's thought police, but the result of a complete lack of popular interest. We must hope that in time, with sustained promotion, this ""real debate"" will cease to resemble a letters page from a pre-1989 edition of Pravda. If not, the only illuminating thing about Blair's Big Conversation might well be its unsettling echoes of Orwell's Big Brother. And then those cynics would have a field day.<B>Little people can dump gongs too</B>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown ended her announcement that she plans to return her MBE with a confession that she is not quite sure how one goes about it. Clearly she does not have the good fortune to live in Islington, where the the clatter of unwanted CBEs, MBEs and OBEs recently became so deafening that the council issued each household with a handy honours recyling bin, in which unwanted medals can simply be left on the doorstep every Monday alongside the boxes containing empty Chardonnay bottles and assorted printed refuse. The honours are then melted down and the profits used to start up call centres in former outposts of the British empire.  But as Alibhai-Brown implied, it may be some time before everyone shares the ""self-contempt"" that she now feels at having accepted her honour. With a perceptiveness reminiscent of Leona Helmsley's, who remarked - as a millionairess - that ""only little people pay taxes"", the Independent columnist noted that, ""It is important to remember that the little people are often in the lists which come out - nurses, community activists, dinner ladies - for whom such recognition is priceless...""  What can be done to bridge this gap; to make these endearingly humble dinner ladies and nurses more receptive to the urgings of that latter-day Jiminy Cricket, Benjamin Zephaniah? Maybe, if like Zephaniah and Alibhai-Brown, the grateful nonentities could be offered recognition of a different kind - a newspaper platform, for example, in which to simultaneously advertise and    repudiate the state's recognition of their achievements - they, too, might be encouraged to snub the authorities? Although they cannot, as a general rule, be allowed a whole article each, there seems no reason why in future, the New Year honours lists should not be accompanied by yet more elite, honours-disdained/returned lists, in which conscience-stricken little people can experience, for a moment, just what it feels like to be big."
0,"If it was upsetting to war veterans, last Sunday's barely-there official commemoration of VE day presumably satisfied one leading non-participant. In an interview published on the same day, and headlined, ""the war ended 60 years ago - get over it"", the German ambassador, Thomas Matussek asserted that the British retain ""an obsession with the Nazi period"", while remaining, he alleged, lamentably ignorant about contemporary Germany. One would not want to exaggerate, and describe it as an ambassadorial obsession, but it has become something of a tradition for German dignitaries to get exercised on this point - so much so that they sometimes seem to forget how very many people, in contemporary Britain, never give the war a second thought. True, the 1995 VE day celebrations were extensive, joyful, and very well attended. But 10 years on, Tony Blair was too busy picking out a gift for Shaun Woodward to put on his doleful face, insert the crack in his voice, and lose a few minutes praying at the Cenotaph.  The ambassadors might also remember that, due to a prior engagement with Bono in Davos, Blair had to declare himself unavailable for a ceremony in January, commemorating the liberation of Auschwitz. In this country, the ceremonies for VE and and VJ day are to be merged into an all purpose commemorative day on July 10.  The prime minister's conspicuous no-show in Moscow earlier this week was only the latest indication that the government has, to quite a remarkable degree, got over it. And yet Matussek rehearses the preoccupations of his predecessor, Gebhardt von Moltke (who asked if British history lessons stopped with the death of Hitler), and of Michael Naumann, the former culture minister, who complained in 1999 that Britain, alone in the world, ""has decided to make the second world war a sort of spiritual core of its national self, understanding and pride"".  Assuming he was correct about this decision, Naumann would surely allow that we seem to be having some trouble sticking to it. In the absence of any significant public recognition of VE day, which will be the last major anniversary witnessed by many survivors, it has been left to the BBC to draw attention to this shrinking generation. In Charles Wheeler's compelling Radio 4 series, Coming   Home, survivors of different nationalities, offer accounts of the aftermath of war - not only the arduous homecomings of 1945, but its legacy today. A woman whose husband was killed in action explained how she still dreams, if anything, she said, more vividly than before, of her husband's safe return.  Devoid of triumphalism, self-congratulation, Vera Lynn-impersonating mawk, Nazi-bashing, or whatever it is that vexes German ambassadors when they spend too long reading the Sun - the radio series makes for wrenching listening, suggesting that, far from getting over it, as a country, we still have much to learn about the war, the more pressingly while there are still survivors ready to talk. Or should we tell them to get over themselves? In one of Wheeler's programmes, a Japanese PoW, David Wilson, remembered how his father, a vicar, did not want to listen. ""I was desperate to tell him what the Japanese were like."" The vicar remained, his son said, utterly uncompassionate. ""It was beneath his dignity to ask what conditions were like.""  In the light of such accounts, Blair's recent reluctance to attend various important 60th-anniversary commemorations appears all the more mysterious. What explanation does he have, for spurning the ceremony at Auschwitz, and sending Jack Straw in his place? For using John Reid as a surrogate at the Cenotaph? For offering John Prescott to the statesmen's line-up in Red Square? If only we could attribute it to Blair's shrewd anticipation of Putin's Stalinist choreography. Or think of this and his other absences as the tactless mistakes of a busy man, rather than as distressing lapses of feeling and judgment. Although Blair is routinely said to have no sense of the past, his non-appearance alongside old allies in this piece of instant historical imagery seems an uncharacteristic oversight for a man who devotes so much thought to his place in history - which he seems to regard as a severe schoolmistress, who will one day tot up his marks and choose whether to damn him, forgive him, or award him some sort of special prize for achievement.  But perhaps, being ostensibly to commemorate the defeat of Nazism, the Moscow solemnities struck Blair as belonging to a part of history which does not interest him overmuch: that long, dark, dreary bit before he came along. We now appreciate that he prefers forward-looking 21st-century celebrations in a brand new dome filled with grateful tinies, to weepy, regressive events featuring Churchilliana and old women.  This perhaps explains why, instead of VE day, British veterans will have to be satisfied with a replacement event in July, scheduled for a day on which, 60 years ago, no one gathered to celebrate, because nothing in particular had happened. It may be a bit soon to claim we're really over Hitler and the Nazis, but even the German ambassador would have to admit, it's a start. <b>The most reluctant Lord Adonis</b>With the election behind us and tumble dryers now such a popular household convenience, many Guardian readers have been debating how best to dispose of their used clothes pegs. I entreat you to waste no time in sending them to Lord Adonis, Andrew as was, to help him through the profound revulsion he must feel on having to accept a peerage. As fans from Lord Adonis's newspaper punditry days will   recall, the new lord was once a determined reformer, who used regularly to denounce the creation of ""a quango Lords"", to insist that ""an elected second chamber is needed to provide a necessary measure of parliamentary independence"", and to urge abolition of all the old titles: ""there is no public enthusiasm for lords, ladies and the other feudal relics"".  The destruction of the lords would be, Lord Adonis proposed, ""a blow against the snobbery and anti-democratic imagery which still permeates Britain"". In its place, he wanted a senate, whose members would receive ""not titles, but the simple designation, 'MS' (member of the Senate), after their unadorned name"". But in 1997, bitterly advising readers to ""forget    the dinner jackets and ""call me Tony"", Andy regretted that ""New Labour looks set to uphold the  ancien rgime . . . politicians will still corner the lion's share of the juiciest plums - namely peerages"".  He could not then have known - who could? - how many juicy plums Blair would also reserve for never-elected flatmates, favourites and paying clients such as Lord Powderject. But were he still in the punditry business, it seems a certainty that these shameless creatures, along with their preposterous new titles, would also have been treated to Andy's most condescending line in ridicule. ""I had forgotten that Ted Short, a stalwart of the Wilson cabinets, was still with us"", he once wrote. ""This was easily done, for on retiring from the Commons, Short   disguised himself as Lord Glenamara. When the former Liberal prime minister HH Asquith performed this trick, reincarnating himself as Earl of Oxford, one wag said it was like a suburban villa calling itself Versailles.""  We can only hope, now that Adonis himself has been reincarnated (title tbc), that he will continue to fight against the lordly affectations which have, in the past, brought on such ecstasies of disdain. ""No one,"" Adonis once wrote, ""likes being abolished, particularly when the perks of existence are as pleasant as those of a peer of the realm.""  But I feel sure, don't you, that if we send him a big enough supply of clothes pegs, Mr Blair's favourite member of the  sans culottes will prove the exception to this rule?","There may, at last, be the beginning of wisdom. Our erstwhile ""natural party of government"" does not expect to win the next election (or, perhaps, the one after that). It's down there in the pits, snarling at the Liberal Democrats, trying to hang on to second place. Even today, through a winter of liverish complaint, it is still failing. But at least abandoning immediate hope is a start. Indeed, Iain Duncan Smith - enduring yet another TV re-relaunch with Frost yesterday - seemed to go out of his way to play Charlie Kennedy without the jokes. He talked only about ""alternative"" policies (to be formulated) and a ""strong, clear sense of direction"" (to be be discovered). His claim to credibility (pure Lib Demery) rested on the supposedly mighty achievements of Tory councils out there in the wide blue yonder, so many of them apparently that few more could be expected in May. The phrase ""when I'm prime minister..."" never crossed his dry, pursed lips.  A turning point. The Conservatives have spent almost six years pretending that Blair and New Labour are merely some brief aberration, a hiccup amid continuing hegemony. They picked William Hague because he was the obvious young pretender, the inheritor. Then they sucked their thumbs and picked Duncan Smith. Now ""desperate Tory MPs"" (according to the Daily Telegraph) are hunting round for some ""men in grey suits"" to give IDS the push. Darkness without much sight of dawn, and six wasted years.  There will doubtless be war in Iraq this year, but there will be no euro referendum. Tony Blair has his own problems. He's wasted his extra layers of popularity. But what does that mean for the Tories?  It means that, at last, they have to be serious. Ken Clarke was the only serious runner in 1997. No go: a no-no on Europe. The assumption, remember, was that somehow the Tories would be swiftly back in office, so couldn't be led by some Brussels-truckling bruiser. And 2001? The same delusion ruled in the end. Duncan Smith's main selling point (with the Telegraph, among others) was that he wasn't Ken.  Yet, with only a thin smear of hindsight, there never was going to be a referendum during Labour's first term. Gordon Brown had got his fix in. And the second term is merely a re-run in less propitious circumstances. Will a third term look any better? Not if the big majorities have begun to shrivel. Not if the Conservatives begin to look remotely electable again. Not if what we fondly remember as ""real politics"" is coming back.  Take a real politician. Kenneth Clarke, now well into his 60s, is never going to be prime minister. He won't be available in 2010. He isn't the man for the long haul. But he is still - just about - the man to rough up a government losing its confidence and way as fatigue starts to gnaw. He knows about running Treasuries and Home Offices and Health and Education. Been there, done that.  Nobody has to look at him, as they do at IDS, and wonder how he would cope. If the job is effective opposition, making up lost ground, bringing a few talented people distantly remembered back on to the front bench, then he remains the obvious choice. If they'd picked him for 2001, then Labour would already be breathing less easily - and 2005 or 2006 would look much more problematic.  But it's surely too late for any of that. Iain Duncan Smith isn't going to fall on his sword because Lord Black of Crossharbour comes calling. The ""Hague rules"" for electing a new leader are death to men in grey suits. The next election is lost and the only remaining question is: how badly? And that is where any sensible party, gradually recovering its scattered wits, would start to think hard.  The job next time is damage limitation. The essential task is seeing off the Liberal Democrats. (Not so easy if Charlie, rather bravely, turns out to have called Iraq right.) The true focus is on the future, on 2010. That may not be instant politics as we know them, a shift to some distant time frame. It may be not suit what remains of the Tory press - ludicrously hailing Bush for his billions in tax cuts and deficits.  The Conservatives won't get another new leader in midstream. They could, however, get a deputy leader, a leader in waiting for next time round. Say Oliver Letwin. They could actually start to develop policies which will have resonance during Labour's third term (when the money has gone in properly and public services are either better or worse). They could resolve their tangle over reduced taxation or increased provision with something a bit more solid than phrase-making.  They could, in short, look serious again by admitting what they seriously know in their hearts: that this is the longest haul, without quick fixes. That, compared with all the toil Neil Kinnock endured, they haven't even begun."

Their favourite meal is fish and chips and they feel sure GM food is a very bad thing. Almost half of them don't think the MMR jab is safe. People underestimate the hygiene complications of preparing a Christmas turkey. They have never heard of the European Constitution. They think parents have the right to know the name and address of any sex offender in the neighbourhood. They think parental selection of a baby's gender is so awful it should be banned. Mercifully, for those who deviate from the majority position on most of the above, the public view does not have to be emulated, or obeyed. We are not subject to its moronic line on literature, music or the paranormal. On gender selection, however, the feelings of the mob are to be enforced. When Suzy Leather, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, explained why this body, after a year's review, now advocates a ban on sex selection, the main reason adduced for the decision was that the majority of people say they don't like the idea. Or as Leather put it, there is ""a substantial public consensus against sex selection for social reasons"". In this area, then, the conduct of your private life is to be directed by public consultation backed by a Mori poll. Unless, that is, you have the energy and cash to defy the public fiat: sex selection is legally available, at a price, at private clinics in America and across the Channel.  Quite why ""people"" should be so against this ostensibly not very wicked expression of a preference is not easily understood. If people had concluded, having completed the relevant research, that gender selection might result in a great preponderance of girls or boys, or an increased number of abortions or incidence of neglect, then one might sympathise with their fears, when polled. The deputy chairman of the HFEA, Tom Baldwin, has said that much of the opposition sprang from ""widespread hostility"", and from anxieties about a ""slippery slope"". So it is not because sex selection was found wanting by the HFEA experts, you gather, so much as to assuage the public's nightmares about designer babies or hundreds of mini-Bin Ladens (quite understandable if you watch a lot of late-night television) that women such as Nicola Chenery, of Plymouth, who really wanted a daughter after her four boys, should now be prevented from having sex selection by IVF at a clinic in Spain. If this decisive body of technophobes had got their way a bit earlier, Chenery's twin baby girls would never have been born. How fortunate, in fact, that Mori polls were not in charge around the time IVF was invented. Ditto blood transfusion and heart transplants.  But it's true: slippery slopes can be awfully worrying. What, for example, are the implications of the HFEA's deferral to public opinion in a country where politicians customarily go to great lengths to avoid doing what the public actually wants? Should we now look forward to seeing paedophiles in the stocks, zero fuel tax, the prohibition of speed limits, a quick exit from Europe and the immediate expulsion of all asylum seekers?  The HFEA's recourse to public sentiment suggests that consultation should go much further than that. Most of us, after all, have some acquaintance with the issues of crime and of tax-paying, some opinion on public services. In the case of sex selection, there can be no recourse to experience or, even, to folk wisdom. It's a question many poll respondents might never have considered before - unless you count inclining, secretly, to one sex or the other.  If fertility experts on the Clapham omnibus can decide policy on gender selection as well as the outcome of Pop Idol, there is no reason why they should not be invited to rule on other scientific advances likely to prompt substantial ethical debate. Those clinicians currently hoping to attempt a facial transplant, for example, and the few gravely disfigured individuals who have expressed interest in the operation, may need to consider not only the profound questions of identity involved in such a procedure, but whether the public will, once again, be so utterly outraged by the affront to nature that doctors, ethicists and prospective patients must all bow to its opinion. <BR><BR><B>Presidents and the right to protest</B><BR><BR>Isn't it time we had Jiang Zemin round? It's been ages and on his last stay, thanks to Robin Cook's insistence on sparing the feelings of the Chinese president, he hardly got to meet anyone. Quite possibly he went home with the idea that the United Kingdom is, leaving aside 1,000-year-old eggs and the occasional peasouper, just like China. A ruthless police state in which any dissent is either concealed from visitors or suppressed, if necessary by violence. But after George Bush's visit, that should all be different, shouldn't it? Even those who maintain that Bush is the vilest ruler of the most evil empire that ever existed must concede that, if his visit helps restore the right to peaceful protest that Cook suddenly withdrew in 1991, it can't have been all bad. Next time Jiang comes to stay, the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens will want to make sure that he sees the welcoming Tibetan flags, banners and T-shirts instead of having all the human rights demonstrators obscured from the presidential view or dragged away by police. Unless, that is, Blair's government has no objection to our shouting abuse at passing democrats, who are probably used to that sort of thing, but draws the line at anything that might offend the sensitive visitor from less tolerant climes.  There's only one way to find out. Come back, Jiang, and next time, bring your mates.<BR><BR><B>Where are the women?</B><BR><BR>Was Patricia Hewitt well advised to make gleeful capital out of Michael Howard's almost all-male shadow cabinet? True, Howard's one-to-12 ratio is almost comically shameful (though he was apparently spurned by Ann Widdecombe). But is Blair's record with women so much better? After the departure, hurt, of Mowlam, Short and Morris, Blair's six senior women (out of a cabinet of 21) are: an extremely disturbed person called Margaret Hodge, who seems in need of a long rest; Tessa Jowell, who is probably busy with the Olympics; the tireless caravanner Margaret Beckett; the not-readily-identifiable Hilary Armstrong; Baroness Valerie Amos (appointed, doesn't count); and Patricia Hewitt herself, who is still having a little difficulty reconciling her 1970s feminism with the present day. The Labour ministers with big jobs, are, like Howard's favourites, all men. Until Labour gets closer to electing a woman leader, any triumphalism in this department looks distinctly premature.","This morning, shortly after he got up, President Bush considered how to get away from ""pettiness and paltriness of mind"". What did his spiritual guide advise? ""Ask God to keep the eyes of your spirit open to the Risen Christ, and it will be impossible for drudgery to damp you."" Thus fortified, Bush resumed hostilities against Iraq. That the president is a devout, born-'again leader of a crusading administration is well known. An article in Newsweek goes into much more detail about his religious practices, evoking the scene ""ahead of the dawn"", when ""even before he brings his wife, Laura, a morning cup of coffee, he goes off to a quiet place to read alone"". Bush's chosen text, Newsweek discloses, is My Utmost for his Highest, a book of devotional readings by Oswald Chambers, an evangelical bible teacher who died in 1917. It provides a biblical text, along with Chambers' commentary, for every day of the year.  Assuming Newsweek is correct, we can all of us, each day, accompany Bush on his spiritual journey. Tomorrow, for example, he is due to contemplate a passage headed Undaunted Radiance, in which Chambers reminds the sinner that ""the experiences of life, terrible or monotonous, are impotent to touch the love of God...""  The calendar format allows us to look back at key moments in this conflict and identify the spiritual text which might have informed the president's day. On January 20, when he announced that he was ""sick and tired of games and deception"", Bush would have begun with a pre-dawn reflection on Isaiah's response to God's call, ""Here am I; send me"". On February 20, the day Bush agreed, with Blair, on a ""final ultimatum"" he would have considered Chapman's exhortation to action, ""always beware of giving over to mere dreaming once God has spoken"". And if, as was reported then, concerted military attack is still fixed for March 14, then that morning Bush will have his mind on higher things: ""There is no release in human power at all, but only in the Redemption"".  Transcribed by Chambers' wife, Gertrude, after his death from appendicitis, My Utmost for His Highest is less concerned with tips on appropriate conduct, than with the forging of an intimate relationship with God: ""If the crisis has come to you on any line, surrender your will to Him absolutely and irrevocably.""  Spiritually, Chapman is a challenging, relentlessly demanding teacher; in worldly terms, he suggests an almost fatalistic surrender to God's purpose (to be disclosed by the God-given outcome of things), which apparently made Chapman popular among troops in Egypt, where he volunteered as an army chaplain during the first world war. At his funeral, according to Oswald Chambers Publications Association Ltd, the charity which holds world rights in his work, 100 men escorted the gun carriage. The charity's general manager, Mary Hutchison, suggests that his purpose was to impart faith to the soldiers, ""so they could be seen through the crisis"".  Today, with both the Pope and the Anglican church condemning war with Iraq as unjust, you can see how Chapman's message of resolute submission to the Almighty might have considerable appeal for America's commander-in-chief, as he confronts the ""axis of evil"". ""Rise to the occasion, do the thing,"" Chapman urges, ""May God not find the whine in us any more, but may he find us full of spiritual pluck and athleticism, ready to face anything he brings"".  To Hutchison's regret, such reflections have never been as popular here as in the US, where ""Utmost"", as she calls it, has sold two million copies since 1991. In Britain it sells 500 copies a month. Thanks to George Bush, that might change. ""I can't tell you how pleased I am"", she says, ""we're so pleased, we've been praying for years that there would be some kind of revival"". Sometimes, God moves in a most mysterious way. <B>But what about snake oil?</B> Imagine the excitement of Mark Field's London constituents when, for the first time anyone could recall, the Conservative MP wrote asking for comments ""on three issues of national importance"". At last - an MP who really cared what they thought about the war, foundation hospitals, climate change, or similar. But it seems Field is kept awake, of a night, by more pressing questions relating to licensing hours, broadcast communications, and perhaps dearest to his heart, snake oil.   ""I am a regular taker of vitamin supplements"", confessed Field, asking his constituents if alternative medicine should be ""embraced more actively"".  Although, with a war almost on, some constituents find Field's investigations faintly superfluous, such democratic commitment, extending, he stresses, to those who are anxious ""about the harmful health effects of dogs defecating in the streets"", is surely exemplary. And besides, maybe he knows of a good alternative smallpox remedy.<B>Cull New Labour</B>Critics of the impending ruddy duck cull argue that it sets an alarming precedent, and certainly if duck-purity principles were to be applied to British political fauna the consequences would be devastating. Given the similarities between the plight of the rare, white-headed duck and that of the endangered British Tory, now vigorously interbreeding with New Labour to produce a probably sterile hybrid, there is every reason, following ruddy duck logic, to carry out a cull of the American intruder. With some scientists concerned that there may be only one native Tory breeding pair left in the country (Mr and Mrs Nicholas Soames), time is short. True, at 915 per bird - or politician - the cost of such intervention is high and might outrage the British public. On the other hand ducks are widely preferred to MPs; in the absence of any politician welfare groups, the ruthless extermination of New Labour might be seen for what it is, a well-meaning attempt to give nature a helping hand. <B>Torygraph goes gothic</B>Readers of the Daily Telegraph, which has just been subjected to an amusing redesign, are divided on the merits of its gothic-style masthead. Is the heavy typeface once chosen by David Beckham to memorialise the birth of his son in a buttock-skimming tattoo, really up-to-the-minute enough for a happening young paper like the Telegraph? After all, Brooklyn has just celebrated his fourth birthday. But a new Heineken advertising campaign featuring similar lettering on the stomach of the young singer Craig David, confirms that the redesign was worth every penny: in the tattoo parlours that presumably contain its target audience of goths, football fans and connoisseurs of fine lagers, the brand new Telegraph will be a must-have."

If fertility experts on the Clapham omnibus can decide policy on gender selection as well as the outcome of Pop Idol, there is no reason why they should not be invited to rule on other scientific advances likely to prompt substantial ethical debate. Those clinicians currently hoping to attempt a facial transplant, for example, and the few gravely disfigured individuals who have expressed interest in the operation, may need to consider not only the profound questions of identity involved in such a procedure, but whether the public will, once again, be so utterly outraged by the affront to nature that doctors, ethicists and prospective patients must all bow to its opinion. <BR><BR><B>Presidents and the right to protest</B><BR><BR>Isn't it time we had Jiang Zemin round? It's been ages and on his last stay, thanks to Robin Cook's insistence on sparing the feelings of the Chinese president, he hardly got to meet anyone. Quite possibly he went home with the idea that the United Kingdom is, leaving aside 1,000-year-old eggs and the occasional peasouper, just like China. A ruthless police state in which any dissent is either concealed from visitors or suppressed, if necessary by violence. But after George Bush's visit, that should all be different, shouldn't it? Even those who maintain that Bush is the vilest ruler of the most evil empire that ever existed must concede that, if his visit helps restore the right to peaceful protest that Cook suddenly withdrew in 1991, it can't have been all bad. Next time Jiang comes to stay, the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens will want to make sure that he sees the welcoming Tibetan flags, banners and T-shirts instead of having all the human rights demonstrators obscured from the presidential view or dragged away by police. Unless, that is, Blair's government has no objection to our shouting abuse at passing democrats, who are probably used to that sort of thing, but draws the line at anything that might offend the sensitive visitor from less tolerant climes.  There's only one way to find out. Come back, Jiang, and next time, bring your mates.<BR><BR><B>Where are the women?</B><BR><BR>Was Patricia Hewitt well advised to make gleeful capital out of Michael Howard's almost all-male shadow cabinet? True, Howard's one-to-12 ratio is almost comically shameful (though he was apparently spurned by Ann Widdecombe). But is Blair's record with women so much better? After the departure, hurt, of Mowlam, Short and Morris, Blair's six senior women (out of a cabinet of 21) are: an extremely disturbed person called Margaret Hodge, who seems in need of a long rest; Tessa Jowell, who is probably busy with the Olympics; the tireless caravanner Margaret Beckett; the not-readily-identifiable Hilary Armstrong; Baroness Valerie Amos (appointed, doesn't count); and Patricia Hewitt herself, who is still having a little difficulty reconciling her 1970s feminism with the present day. The Labour ministers with big jobs, are, like Howard's favourites, all men. Until Labour gets closer to electing a woman leader, any triumphalism in this department looks distinctly premature.","I>Poor Mr Baradei,   <BR>His mission is a parody:    <BR>He tells the states (with some aplomb)    <BR>They can and cannot have the bomb</I>Here is the world's most nonsensical job description. Your duty is to work tirelessly to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And to work tirelessly to encourage the proliferation of the means of building them. This is the task of the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei.  He is an able diplomat, and as bold as his predecessor, Hans Blix, in standing up to the global powers. But what he is obliged to take away with one hand, he is obliged to give with the other. His message to the non-nuclear powers is this: you are not allowed to develop the bomb, but we will give you the materials and expertise with which you can build one. It is this mortal contradiction which permitted the government of Iran this weekend to tell him to bog off.  His agency's motto - ""Atoms for Peace"" - wasn't always a lie. In 1953, when Eisenhower founded it with his famous speech to the United Nations, people really seemed to believe that nuclear fission could solve the world's problems. An article in the Herald Tribune, for example, promised that atomic power would create ""an earthly paradise... Our automobiles eventually will have atomic energy units built into them at the factory so that we will never have to refuel them... In a relatively short time we will cease to mine coal.""  Eisenhower seemed convinced that the nuclear sword could be beaten into the nuclear ploughshare. ""It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace."" The nuclear powers, he said, ""should... make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials"" which should then be given to ""the power-starved areas of the world"", ""to provide abundant electrical energy"". This would give them, he argued, the necessary incentive to forswear the use of nuclear weapons.  The IAEA, its statute says, should assist ""the supplying of materials, equipment, or facilities"" to non-nuclear states. It should train nuclear scientists and ""foster the exchange of scientific and technical information"". Its mission, in other words, is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons, while spreading nuclear technology to as many countries as possible. It is also responsible for enforcing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which has the same dual purpose.  There might have been a case, while Eisenhower's dream could still be dreamt. But to persist with this programme long after it became clear that it caused proliferation, not containment,   suggests that the global powers are living in a world of make-believe. The International Atomic Energy Agency has put nuclear technology ""into the hands of those who will know how to strip its civilian casing and adapt it to the arts of war"".  It's not difficult. Every state which has sought to develop a nuclear weapons programme over the past 30 years - Israel, South Africa, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Iraq - has done so by diverting resources from its nuclear power programme. In some cases they built their weapons with the direct assistance of Atoms for Peace.  India developed its bomb with the help of fissionable material and expertise from Canada, the US, Germany, France, Norway and the UK. Pakistan was able to answer the threat with the help of Canada, the US, Germany, France, Belgium, China and the UK. In the name of peace, we equipped these nations for total war.  Now there are about 20 countries which, as a result of foreign help for their civilian nuclear programmes, could, if they choose, become nuclear weapons states within months. When Russia shipped uranium and the technologies required to build a bomb to Iran, it not only had a right to do so: under the non-proliferation treaty, it had a duty to do so.  It's not yet clear whether Iran has stepped over the brink. It is plainly enriching uranium and producing heavy water, which could enable it to build both uranium- and plutonium-based bombs. But both processes are also legitimate means of developing materials for nuclear power generation. To enrich uranium from power-grade to bomb-grade you need only pass it through the centrifuges a few more times. The non-proliferation treaty gives Iran both the right to own the materials and the cover it requires to use them for a weapons programme. If you want to build a bomb, you simply sign the treaties, join the IAEA, then use your entitlements to do what they were designed to prevent.  Iran certainly has plenty of motives for seeking to become a nuclear power. Israel has enough nuclear weapons to wipe it off the map. Sheltered by the US, it has no incentive to dismantle them and sign the non-proliferation treaty. Both the US and the UK have abandoned their own obligations to disarm, and appear to be contemplating a new generation of nuclear weapons. Both governments have also suggested that they would be prepared to use them pre-emptively. Iran is surrounded by American military bases, and is one of the two surviving members of the axis of evil. The other one, North Korea, has been threatening its neighbours with impunity. Why? Because it has the bomb. If Iran is not developing a nuclear weapons programme, it hasn't understood the drift of global politics.   But what can El Baradei do? He can beg Iran to stop developing enriched uranium, but the treaty he is supposed to be enforcing gives him no authority to do so: the government has pointed out that it's legally entitled to pursue all the processes he fears. This is why he's seeking to persuade it to stick to ""voluntary agreements"".  I hope I don't need to explain how dangerous all this is. The official nuclear powers have junked the non-proliferation treaty, while the non-nuclear powers are using it to develop their own programmes. If Hizbullah clobbers Israel, Israel might turn on Iran, and the Middle East could go up in nuclear dust, rapidly followed by everyone else who has decided to join the second nuclear arms race. And the man charged with preventing this from happening is still facilitating it.  The obvious conclusion is that you can't phase out nuclear weapons without phasing out nuclear power. Now that the old treaty has become worse than useless, now that the promise of an earthly paradise of free power and electricity too cheap to meter has been shown to be false, isn't it time for a new nuclear treaty, based not on Eisenhower's chiliastic fantasy but on grim global realities? Isn't it time for Mr Baradei to stop destroying the world in order to save it?  www.monbiot.com"
1,"Just what did Osama bin Laden's signature say to you? To me, it looked just like you'd expect the faxed handwriting of a terrorist mastermind in a hurry to look like, but I could be wrong. To Erik Rees of the British Institute of Graphologists, who was consulted by the Times, the smudgy scrawl suggested that Bin Laden was ""not a happy man"", with ""a deep feeling in him that he has bitten off more than he can chew"". The round bit (""graphologists call this a cocoon"") in the middle showed a need for ""self-protection"". In a roundish sort of cave, perhaps? Meanwhile, the ""three leading figures"" from the British Academy of Graphology, consulted by the Daily Telegraph, used a different, ""ancient"" technique to diagnose Bin Laden as ""a rebellious individualist"" with ""an above-average libido"". Impressive as this is (particularly as none of the graphologists appears to have been Arabists), if these two leading broadsheets intend to persist with this unconventional form of character analysis, it might be an idea if, next time, they extract their graphologists' opinions before revealing the author's identity. Otherwise, people might get the idea that graphology is something more than a voguish species of divination, as useless and as about as tasteless as would be casting Bin Laden's horoscope.  The arrival of graphologists on our horror-dominated front pages may not be as gruesome as the popular hots for Nostradamus, but it's close - uncomfortably close.","Launching his Big Conversation last week, Tony Blair issued a little warning to those enemies of the state who would, he predicted, rubbish this ""real debate"" about the future of our nation. ""There are obvious risks in this. The policy choices are hard. The cynics will sneer."" And if the cynics did sneer, even before the exercise had properly started, those responsible for naming Blair's great mission after a recent management consultancy wheeze at the BBC should perhaps take some of the blame. Almost a week later, with around 50 contributions on the website, the least cynical eavesdropper would have to admit that conversation is, to put it mildly, stilted. A typical participant begins: ""I am so proud to have voted Labour with my first ever vote a few years ago. Everywhere I look I see new cars, wealth, opportunities, investment and most favourable mortgage rates.""  Fellow chatterers do not so much reply to these sallies, as attempt to outstrip them in flattery. Caroline, for instance, speaks highly of British trains. ""I experience a reasonably good rail service as I commute to work in London. When I've needed a doctor or hospital service, the NHS has always delivered the best services quickly."" Other contributors, such as Carrie, contrast their current bliss with the hardship and evil of the old, Thatcherite days. ""I can remember when I was young growing up with Conservatives and my mum had to work every hour to try and keep me and my sister and there was no childcare facilities.""  Another contributor writes: ""In the old days, before the glorious Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under...""  Actually, that comes from the party's history textbook in Orwell's 1984. Still, the intended effect is surely not that different from this Big Conversation contribution from Jayne, a teacher: ""Have people forgotten the poll tax, the massive interest rates and all the sleaze of that administration?"" Or Ian's memories of the 80s when, ""I wallowed on the dole. I was in despair, forever chasing Tory dreams - 'get on your bike', 'woolly hats' etc, etc. Ten years after voting Tony Blair in, I am now in a very well-paid job, I have a property here in the UK and a property in Tenerife (Spain). Things have certainly 'got better' for me and all my friends who have similarly suffered in the past and have excelled under the New Labour parliament.""  Naturally, those running the Big Conversation have realised that, for the sake of credibility, these impeccably loyal effusions need to be balanced with some constructive criticism. A P O'Neill, for example, pleads for ""many more party political broadcasts on TV and radio so we can hear directly from our leaders what they really think, what the problems really involve and how they can be sorted out... The TV and radio should be obliged to carry short government broadcasts each night so that a real debate could be founded on proper information and facts.""  And if I can join in the Big Conversation for a second, why stop there? Ideally, a telescreen in every flat would broadcast party news continually, untroubled by the media cynics and pundits whose carping seem to have upset several contributors to the Big Conversation. Imagine bulletins from Iraq that were uninterrupted by unwelcome equivocation about civilian casualties, brutality, WMDs, but ran along the following lines: ""I am authorised to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end.""  In reality, the war in Iraq is a subject the Big Conversationalists have yet, at the time of writing, to engage with (those Conversationalists, that is, whose contributions have been selected for the website). Ditto international relations, George Bush, terrorism, the EU constitution, drugs, asylum, foundation hospitals, parliamentary democracy, waiting lists, council tax, prisons, the House of Lords, the new supreme court, identity cards and the state of London Underground. On the other hand, experiences of the NHS mentioned here have been, without exception, positive: ""the care... was second to none"". On student fees, there is just the one contribution, from Alex, 19: ""I think tuition fees are important because they make people realise the value of education.""  A foreigner consulting this website to enhance her understanding of this country could only conclude, like the visitors to Stalin's wholesome Potemkin villages, that all is for the best under this best of all possible administrations. Or, as Andy Saxon, who was invited to contribute to the site, put it: ""I think Tony Blair's got an impossible job but he does it well.""  There are, inevitably, various hopeless personal petitions of the sort traditionally reserved for the attention of constituency MPs - who are, presumably, overjoyed to see so many monomaniacs diverted out of their surgeries and into this new bores' paradise. Labour has promised to consider comments from all such supplicants, who currently include: a man who says the NHS dentists near him are full; a woman preoccupied with the A36 bypass; a man who wants classical music on the underground; a woman who says we need legal protection for pagans. So far the only substantial and consistent source of complaint to emerge on the site is anti-social behaviour; a problem which, since it reflects worst on the parents and children responsible, can hardly be attributed to government incompetence.  But the Conversation has only just begun. Perhaps not many people have written in yet. Perhaps its unnerving tone of virtually unqualified approval is not so much the achievement of Labour's thought police, but the result of a complete lack of popular interest. We must hope that in time, with sustained promotion, this ""real debate"" will cease to resemble a letters page from a pre-1989 edition of Pravda. If not, the only illuminating thing about Blair's Big Conversation might well be its unsettling echoes of Orwell's Big Brother. And then those cynics would have a field day.<B>Little people can dump gongs too</B>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown ended her announcement that she plans to return her MBE with a confession that she is not quite sure how one goes about it. Clearly she does not have the good fortune to live in Islington, where the the clatter of unwanted CBEs, MBEs and OBEs recently became so deafening that the council issued each household with a handy honours recyling bin, in which unwanted medals can simply be left on the doorstep every Monday alongside the boxes containing empty Chardonnay bottles and assorted printed refuse. The honours are then melted down and the profits used to start up call centres in former outposts of the British empire.  But as Alibhai-Brown implied, it may be some time before everyone shares the ""self-contempt"" that she now feels at having accepted her honour. With a perceptiveness reminiscent of Leona Helmsley's, who remarked - as a millionairess - that ""only little people pay taxes"", the Independent columnist noted that, ""It is important to remember that the little people are often in the lists which come out - nurses, community activists, dinner ladies - for whom such recognition is priceless...""  What can be done to bridge this gap; to make these endearingly humble dinner ladies and nurses more receptive to the urgings of that latter-day Jiminy Cricket, Benjamin Zephaniah? Maybe, if like Zephaniah and Alibhai-Brown, the grateful nonentities could be offered recognition of a different kind - a newspaper platform, for example, in which to simultaneously advertise and    repudiate the state's recognition of their achievements - they, too, might be encouraged to snub the authorities? Although they cannot, as a general rule, be allowed a whole article each, there seems no reason why in future, the New Year honours lists should not be accompanied by yet more elite, honours-disdained/returned lists, in which conscience-stricken little people can experience, for a moment, just what it feels like to be big."

A seven-year-old Swedish boy tramps the streets of Phuket, searching for his parents and two brothers. A mother from the Andaman Islands weeps as she feeds her baby. The poster children of disaster and the pietas of grief are the images that cling, rather than the bodies washed ashore in a soup of debris. As the new year begins, the story of the tsunami is being shaped into a simple parable. Nature is vicious and people are kind; 150,000 corpses and 50 million in British donations alone stack up to prove a message that turns global wisdom on its head. In 2004, manmade disaster prised nations and religions apart, as dead children, from Beslan to Baghdad, supplied proof of human viciousness. Then, in a codicil to a year of terror, the planet showed that it could do apocalypse and primal fear better than any mortal agent.  So goodbye cosmic solitude, banished in a tragedy that united rich tourists with the 'sea gypsies' of poor Muslim communities, eking out such a threadbare existence on the shoreline of paradise that the tidal wave bore no economic sting to the countries it devastated. The tsunami's damage to India, for example, is likely to amount to only 0.07 per cent of its gross domestic product.  Anguish is not often universal. Susan Sontag, the American writer who died of leukaemia last week, argued that victims guarded their sorrows jealously. 'It is intolerable to have one's own sufferings twinned with anyone else's,' she wrote. Not any more, as newspaper elegists focus on victims from Surrey to Sumatra and the world huddles round its shared catastrophe.  The vast sums collected reflect, beyond altruism, a hope that the wildness of nature and the folly of men can be bought off in corporate donations and pensioners' heating allowances. Individuals' generosity, though praiseworthy and humbling, suggests something more complicated than kindness.  Hideous and dramatic scenes instil to help, but they also catalyse an adrenaline of mourning. That mood does not necessarily promise a better tomorrow. The solidarity following 9/11 fractured into revenge that ushered in a more perilous world and bystanders inured to the pain of others. In contrast to the audit of tragedy after the tsunami, no government bothered to count the bodies of Iraqi civilians.  Collective emotion is always fickle and sometimes tainted. In one of the last great outbreaks of group grieving, cellophane-wrapped bouquets piled up for Princess Diana, and the media clamoured for leadership. Just as the Queen was bidden back from Balmoral, so Tony Blair was urged to get off his Egyptian deckchair and fly home. The mawkish wake for Diana is not to be compared with the heartfelt response of people who could understand, in the tsunami victims' agony, how it must feel to watch a partner drown, to cry in vain for a lost child or to lament the disappeared.  But both real and synthetic grief slide easily into blame. Scapegoats of the tsunami range from organised religion to shambolic aid providers to moneyed Westerners with an unhealthy yen for beachside primitivism. For blamers and the givers to draw what sense and solace they can from horror is not a disreputable response.  It is not an endorsement of William Hazlitt's view that love of cruelty is as natural as sympathy to human beings, let alone of Edmund Burke's belief that we have 'a degree of delight' in the pain of strangers. Modern citizens, sated by images of death, do not need a tsunami to teach them how randomly the bell tolls.  But disaster also offers a strange comfort. The solidarity of giving assuages the guilt and fractiousness of societies normally force-fed on fear and mistrust. It also lulls people into using the unthinkable as an affirmation of their own worldviews, rather than the challenge it should be.  Secularists deride the platitudes of churchmen and ask how the religious can believe in a god who sanctions such atrocities. The devout criticise the nihilism of rationalists and describe their own faith as a candle in the darkness. Creationists, who still think that 'the fountains of the great deep' in Genesis 7.11 signified the tsunami that launched Noah and his floating zoo, presumably consider the latest earthquake another instalment in the Almighty's great partwork.  Those who consider global warming an overrated fuss see the earthquake as proof that outlawing aerosols and recycling the new year champagne bottles are pointless gestures. More plausibly, people who warn that the world is on a reckless path to self-destruction decipher in the earthquake an urgent warning of what is happening to a planet cursed by hurricanes, typhoons and rising seas.  The tsunami has confirmed, and never confounded, the views of its spectators. An earthquake may tilt the world on its axis, but it cannot shake the human mind. President Bush, whose initial pledge of $15m was half the cost of his inauguration, will still not sign up to Kyoto. Mr Blair writes boldly in the Economist of 'aiming high' on climate change during the presidency of the G8, but many worry that his market-based approach to climate change and lack of curbs on lavish energy consumers smack of pitching his efforts far too low.  Ordinary citizens, even the most generous, need to notice the 30,000 children under five who die each day, irrespective of whether their corpses lie alongside those of Western babies. The godless, like me, should never presume to see catastrophe as a snub to people of faith, just as all believers should acknowledge that their god is supremely short of answers when worlds cave in and children rot to death in hospital corridors.  The donations will be counted, the aid will kick in and the monolith of the UN will creak into action, for a time. New earthquake monitors will ensure that no crab can scuttle across the floor of the Indian Ocean without activating a sensor in Jakarta or Bangkok.  But nothing will really change unless the spirit of global co-operation is real. That means confronting the overlapping problems of climate change, humanitarian crises and war. It means never again embarking so recklessly on the sort of manufactured catastrophe still unrolling in Iraq. It means realising that a volatile planet and uniquely powerful warmongers form a mix no species can reliably withstand.  The tsunami offers many lessons, but one is the selectivity of pity. A Swedish boy searches for his parents. A mother from a vanishing tribe gazes across her infant's body through a wall of tears, and the world responds to both. But the test of compassion is what happens next to millions of people made hungry and poor by acts of nature and global policy alike.  In the optimistic view, people have signalled a universal empathy not just with last week's survivors but with the legions of shadowy victims marginalised, demonised or massacred at the whim of the mighty. Citizens have distilled the essence of reform. It is up to politicians to bottle and sell it."
